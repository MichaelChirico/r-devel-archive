Subject: [R-sig-Geo] Advice on starting to analyze smokestack emissions?
References: <c3506d1310f8d49694bf34b016393d8c020924e1.camel@zembower.org>

Hello, all,

I'm trying to get started analyzing the concentrations of smokestack
emissions. I don't have any professional background or training for
this; I'm just an old, retired guy who thinks playing with numbers is
fun.

A local funeral home in my neighborhood (less than 1200 ft from my
home) is proposing to construct a crematorium for human remains. I have
some experience with the tidycensus package and thought it might be
interesting to construct a model for the changes in concentrations of
the pollutants from the smokestack and, using recorded wind speeds and
directions, see which US Census blocks would be affected.

I have the US Government EPA SCREEN3 output on how concentration varies
with distance from the smokestack.
See?https://www.epa.gov/scram/air-quality-dispersion-modeling-screening-models#screen3
if curious. As a first task, I'd like to see if I can calculate similar
results in R. I'm aware of the 'plume' steady-state Gaussian dispersion
package, but am a little concerned that this package was last updated
11 year ago.

As professionals in this field, do you have any recommendations for me
on how to get started analyzing this problem? Is 'plume' still the way
to go? I'm aware that there are many atmospheric dispersion models from
the US EPA, but I was hoping to keep my work within R, which I'm really
enjoying using and learning about. Are SCREEN3 and 'plume' comparable?
Is this the best R list to ask questions about this topic?

Thanks for any advice or guidance you have for me.

-Kevin

Dear community,

I am recently digging into the quadrat test in library(spatstat). It is known that if you plot the result of quadrat.test, you will get three numbers in each grid: the observed number of points, the expected number of points assuming CSR holds, and the "residual".

For example:
library(spatstat)
plot(ponderosa, pch=16, cex=0.5, cols='grey50')
quadrat.test(ponderosa, 3, 4) -> a
plot(a, add=TRUE)

And you get:
[cid:16f82480-6395-4498-9ce8-742cbbd41660]

According to what I learnt about the quadrat test (Rogersson and Yamada 2005, p. 48), and the help document from quadrat.test, I assume the "residual" should be (observed-expected)^2/expected. However, the numbers in the above figure does not support my guess. Take the first grid as an example, in this grid 15 points are observed, with an expectation of 9. So the "residual" should be (15-9)^2/9=4, rather than 2.

Moreover, if you look at the 2nd, 3rd, and 5th grids, you will find that when the observed number of points is deviating from the expectation, the "residual" grows linearly rather than squarely, indicating there is no squared term in the numerator when calculating the "residual", letting alone the sum of them does not agree with the reported chi-squared statistic.

I will be grateful if someone can shed some light on how this "residual" calculated.
Thanks in advance!

This is where the open source code matters.

The code here at https://github.com/spatstat/spatstat.explore/blob/52a94f6a90314c593472f7b1a80da36e7a99585a/R/quadrattest.R#L286 shows:

residuals = (OBS - EXP)/sqrt(EXP)

and:

> all.equal((a$observed - a$expected)/sqrt(a$expected), a$residuals)
[1] TRUE

This is also documented in the big Spatial Point Patterns book, Baddeley, Rubak & Turner (2015), p. 166, described as Pearson residuals.

The definition you refer to is:

(a$observed - a$expected)^2/a$expected

which is the vector summed to perform the basic Chi-square test.

?quadrat.test and the book section are worth reading, especially the criticism of quadrat tests in general, as they are badly affected by the number and position of the chosen rectangles, just as histograms are badly affected by the positioning of the breaks.

Hope this clarifies,

Roger

Dear Prof. Bivand,

Thank you very much for your crystal-clear answer, my question is well resolved. And thank you for the recommendation of Baddeley, Rubak & Turner (2015), I will read it.

I agree with your comment on the impact of the study area on the statistic itself. As long as the study area/observing window is large enough, any point pattern is clustered. (But it also gives me the sense that, an 'optimal' or 'characteristic' study area may exist for a given point pattern, with the cost that such an 'optimal' study area will be sensitive to the location of a few peripheral points.)

Stay warm, and happy holidays!

Message-ID: <CAGg5H0bxr=KdP6R9v6TOubGjHm=8WObziZzKagKdyc=_TOkkDQ@mail.gmail.com>

I have 12 raster images which I stack them. Then I converted the
rasterstack to a matrix, I remove the NA's from the matrix and I convert
the matrix to monthly time-series matrix. Finally, I run the bfastlite
function, like so:

library(bfast)

wd <- "path"

l <- list.files(paste0(wd), pattern='.tif$',
                all.files=TRUE, full.names=FALSE)

r <- raster::stack(paste0(wd, l))

m <- raster::as.matrix(r)
m <- m[!rowSums(is.na(m)), ]

# convert the matrix to timeseries matrix
tm <- ts(data = m, start = c(2019, 1), end = c(2019, 12), frequency = 12,
class = "ts")
class(tm)

bf <- bfastlite(
  tm,
  formula = response ~ trend + harmon,
  order = 3,

  stl = "trend",
  decomp = "stl",
  sbins = 1,
  h = 0.5,
  level = 0.5,
  type = "OLS-MOSUM"
)
And the error:

Error in stats::stl(x, s.window = "periodic") :
  series is not periodic or has less than two periods

I have tried many variations in the parameters of the bfastlite function.

Any ideas what that error means and how I can overcome it? The dataset can
be downloaded from my GoogleDrive (
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1V115zpdU2-5fXssI6iWv_F6aNu4E5qA7).

Could it be that the 12 monthly data do not show more than one full 
period of whatever the rasters are showing? That seems to be what the 
error is indicating. If you want to decompose some seasonal time series, 
then you need several seasons of data.

Subject: [R-sig-Geo] Plotting part of the nb object
Message-ID: <BN7PR15MB2244502DB8126AE7BFC16577B099A@BN7PR15MB2244.namprd15.prod.outlook.com>

Dear community,

I am using the plot() method (actually plot.nb() method) to visually discover the neighborhood network generated by poly2nb() and its sibling functions. When I want to plot only part of the neighborhood network to make a visual comparison, I intuitively tried something like below, but failed:

library(sf)
library(spdep)
library(spDataLarge)

poly2nb(bristol_zones) -> bqueen
plot(bqueen[5], st_geometry(bristol_zones)) # This line will fail

I am thinking of extracting the neighboring regions into a new sf object, then drawing the neighborhood network of the new sf object, but it won't give me what I want: instead of a stellated-shaped ego-network, it still contains the redundant peripheral edges:

bristol_zones[c(5, bqueen[[5]]), ] -> temp
plot(poly2nb(temp), st_geometry(temp)) # This line generates unwanted peripheral edges

Is there any built-in or roundabout method to plot part of the nb object?

Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!

I do believe the plot is correct. That's because "South Gloucestershire 
005" is a neighbor to "South Gloucestershire 018" and the edges are 
drawn for all neighbors in the (sub)set. Your workaround to create a 
temporary sf object first might be the best solution, as plot.nb() 
requires nb class object.

t <- poly2nb(bristol_zones)
t5 <- bristol_zones[c(5, t[[5]]), ]

t <- poly2nb(t5)

plot(1,
 ? xlim = c(sf::st_bbox(t5)[1], sf::st_bbox(t5)[3]),
 ? ylim = c(sf::st_bbox(t5)[2], sf::st_bbox(t5)[4]),
 ? xlab = "", ylab = ""
)
plot(t5[, c("name", "geometry")], add = TRUE)
plot.nb(t, st_geometry(t5), add = TRUE)

Regards,
Grzegorz
