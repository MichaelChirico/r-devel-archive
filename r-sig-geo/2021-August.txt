Subject: [R-sig-Geo] question about accessing geometry from an sf object
Message-ID: <CACxE24nntrgVeND4Xy2GEdAUt0Efx=deuUt+N6At1RAh_E_7kw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello!

I have the following sf object:

> bt.cent
Simple feature collection with 8 features and 1 field
Geometry type: POINT
Dimension:     XY
Bounding box:  xmin: -105.0746 ymin: 38.97641 xmax: -104.7917 ymax: 39.82494
CRS:           +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs
   rnorm.10.                   geometry
1  0.3297790 POINT (-105.0746 38.97641)
2         NA POINT (-104.7917 38.97641)
3 -1.0734667 POINT (-105.0746 39.25925)
4         NA POINT (-104.7917 39.25925)
5 -0.1284898  POINT (-105.0746 39.5421)
6 -0.4071287  POINT (-104.7917 39.5421)
7         NA POINT (-105.0746 39.82494)
8  1.4171128 POINT (-104.7917 39.82494)

And I am accessing the geometry (to build covariances) as:
> bt.cent$geometry[[1]][1]
[1] -105.0746
> bt.cent$geometry[[1]][2]
[1] 38.97641

Is that the best way to handle the geometry items, please?

Thanks in advance,
Sincerely,
Erin

Hi Erin,

Maybe consider st_coordinates() to get a matrix of coordinates, 
preferably from st_geometry() of the "sf" object, as hard-coding the name 
of the column containing the "sfc" object might be affected in some cases 
by a different name. Then subset the matrix as you wish.

Hope this helps,

Roger

I am conducting a study of Regionalization for the Ministry of Health of Colombia, using a MST and SKATER algorithm proposed by Assauncao. I have included 121 social and health covariates sumarized on a SImilarity matrix (After Explratory Factor analysis dimensiionality treatment).? that will be used into skater function.
I am using a spatialpolygons dataframe with the 1081 municipalities? that I've proccesed with nb2list() function. Also I have the geographic distance? (extracted from openstreetmaps) from each capital city to anotherone, and I want to use it in nbcosts() function.? When? I read the nbcosts documentation I read that the data must be in dataframe class object but what i have is a dist object. The code does not show any error but im not sure how the dist object is computing it.
> ady <- poly2nb(colpeso.utmsub)

I suppose that I have to covert a dist object into a nbdist object? or find the way to use it properly into nbcost function,?
I'll apreciate your opinion on this.?
Thank you in advance

No, this is not a sensible way of using this approach. The data.frame 
should contain observations for the spatial objects on variables relevant 
for the regionalization being undertaken, not a distance matrix. These 
variables might be demographic, socio-economic, or others relevant to the 
regionalization. It is the "distance" in variable, not geographic, space 
that is used to weight the edges of the graph, so that less similar edges 
are dropped and more similar edges retained. The geographical distances 
between observations are implicit in the neighbour graph - see 
https://keen-swartz-3146c4.netlify.app/area.html#higher-order-neighbours 
for a discussion. Run example(skater) to see that four variables are used 
in the dpad data.frame.

Hope this clarifies,

Roger

Subject: [R-sig-Geo] question on the use of Leaflet for plotting points and
 rater GeoTIFF
Message-ID: <CAAKwTDEeiNdDLs8FnqLMraDvS1kvbio_fV8e-sjcGJTVfOtjTA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello.

I would like to use Leaflet package to plot over a Google Satellite base
map :

1.  a shapefile of polygon
2.  a shapefile of points
3,  a GeoTIFF image

I could use the Leaflet package to get plotted successfully only the first
Item of the list above with the following code :

require(rgdal)
library(rgeos)
library(raster)

shapeData <- raster::shapefile('Seattle_boundries.shp')
shapeData <- spTransform(shapeData, CRS("+proj=longlat +ellps=GRS80"))

leaflet() %>%
  addTiles(urlTemplate = "
https://mts1.google.com/vt/lyrs=s&hl=en&src=app&x={x}&y={y}&z={z}&s=G",
attribution = 'Google')  %>%
  addPolygons(data=shapeData,weight=5,col = 'red')

How is it possible to find a way to complete the code above for plotting
the item 2 and 3 as well in the same Leaflet figure.

Is there any possible solution that can enable this task?

Thanks for your help.

Kind regards
Gabriel

Dear Ben,

Thanks a lot for your help!
Actually it worked very well for me with the link you gave me.
However, for some reason the numbers of the values in color scale goes from
the lower values set at the top  (blue) of the sacale to the higher values
set at the bottom (red ) and it would be better for me if it goes from from
the lower values in the bottom (blue) to higher value in the top (red),
since is temperature going from the lower to the higher.
 Another issue I found a bit problematic for me to modify is that the color
palette is too "light", for instance not like the color palette "Jet" in
Matlab or Python, it seems as if the intensity of the colors of the
temperature colors is low or light maybe is a transparency and should
change opacity ....?

Maybe you or somebody knows a possible way to improve these two issues a
bit ?

Here is the code :

# color palettes
# pal <- colorNumeric(palette = "Spectral", values(raster), na.color =
"transparent" , reverse = TRUE)
pal <- colorNumeric(palette = "RdYlBu", values(raster), na.color =
"transparent" , reverse = TRUE)

# plot map
leaflet() %>%
  addTiles(urlTemplate = "
https://mts1.google.com/vt/lyrs=s&hl=en&src=app&x={x}&y={y}&z={z}&s=G",
attribution = 'Google')  %>%
  addPolygons(data = polygon,weight=5,col = 'black')  %>%
  addCircles(data = points, color = "White", radius = 500, fillOpacity =
1,opacity = 9)%>%
  addRasterImage(raster, project = FALSE, colors = pal) %>%
  addLegend(pal = pal, values = values(raster), title = "Temperature",
opacity = 9)  # ,labFormat = labelFormat(transform = function(x) sort(x,
decreasing = TRUE)))

Thanks a lot again for your help.
Kind regards,
Gabriel

Hi,

I don't think we can run the code since it isn't reproducible (see
https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=reprex
<https://cran.r-project.org/package=reprex> for help with that.)  But here
are some hints:

flipped color bar - I love to use RSeek.org which is an R-centric search
engine -  you may want to bookmark it or add it to your search engine list
if your browser supports that. https://rseek.org/?q=leaflet+flip+color+bar
This search hits a number of discussions on flipping the color bar.

color intensity - oooooh, there is so much discussion in the world about
colors.  By default raster images have opacity of 1 (fully opaque) when
rendered in leaflet, so really it is a matter of finding the color table
you want and then applying colorNumeric judiciously.  For me it comes down
to trial and error.  If you are looking for eye pop! then perhaps check out
the viridis options.  See ?colorNumeric

Cheers,
Ben

Dear Ben,

Thanks a lot for your help with the useful and appropriate link you sent
me. There was the solution for the flipping of the colorbar.
I could finally flip the color bar and it worked out correctly. I also
found a little bit less opaque color palette, that is the matlab "jet"
color in the R "matlab" package, but it is still a bit opaque for
my personal taste. I will give it some trials and errors with many
different opacities to see what happened.

Thanks a lot again for your helpful advice and guidance,

Kind regards,
Gabriel

Subject: [R-sig-Geo] Uncertainty of a spatial model
Message-ID: <9815e283-3eb8-a778-5f21-2ccb21bfc288@yeah.net>

Hi there,

I have encountered difficulties in determining the uncertainty of a 
spatial model. I hope you would like to share your knowledge and help 
me. Thanks in advance!

Here we assume that we have three input layers, A, B, and C, and one 
output layer R with R = A + B + C. I hope to estimate how the 
uncertainty of input layers propagates to the model output.

I learned that the input layer could be treated as a spatial random 
field, and the uncertainty could be estimated with MCMC algorithm[1]. 
However, I don't know how to include the spatial component of the model 
into the MCMC.

Any hint will be really appreciated.

Best wishes,
Jinsong
