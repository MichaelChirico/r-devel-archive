Subject: [R-sig-Geo] spgwr package alpha (depends on sp) on sourceforge
In-Reply-To: <002901c43d56$bf0368d0$268001db@webgis>
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0406100922390.2718-100000@reclus.nhh.no>

Partly as a response to the discussion between Hisaji Ono and Danlin Yu, 
and partly because Danlin has made lots of helpful contributions of ideas 
and code, source packages and Windows binary packages for sp and spgwr are 
now available on:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/r-spatial/

spgwr implements some of the methods used in Geographically Weighted 
Regression (Stewart Fotheringham, Chris Brunsdon, Martin Charlton, 2002, 
Wiley), but the implementations are not authoritative, and are intended 
for exploring the potential of the proposed methods.

Remember to install sp first - spgwr depends on it!

Documentation is incomplete, please look at the examples or in function 
code for further information; this will improve. Anybody have nice 
examples that we can use?

The sp release notes are: Minor modifications to package - please note 
this is still alpha, and any production work objects must also be stored 
in externally readable formats, because the slots in the classes can 
change!

The spgwr notes: This very early alpha package builds on earlier work and
major contributions by Danlin Yu, and provides both GWR functions, the
Georgia data set from the GWR bo ok, and is at the same time a testbed for
using the S4 classes from the sp packa ge in an analytical setting. As
mentioned, this is a trial release, and both obj ect formats and the way
results are calculated will change - store all important data in
externally retrievable formats!

Please pass comments to me as package maintainer, input is very welcome!

Hi,

It is happy to see version-up of maptools.  I admire Roger's work.

However the change-log that may describe the improvement of maptools
was not found.  Is not there system to inform the difference in R
package?

Thanks a lot for this comment - implemented in maptools_0.4-5, sent to 
CRAN/incoming this morning, should be available before long. The solution 
is a file called "changes" in inst/ in the source package, in the package 
root when installed, and accessed by maptools(changes=TRUE); it may be 
improved internally, but the access function should continue to look like 
this. 

The recent changes have been caused by stress-testing with strange
shapefiles, with 0.4-4 trying to avoid occasional crashes under Windows
(re-writing C code for interfacing shapelib functions) and 0.4-5 removing
a buffer overflow when DBF files had character fields wider than 50
characters.

Please bear with me on these changes - the longer-term goal is to read 
point shapefiles into an S4 class SpatialDataFrame and polygons into 
SpatialDataFramePolygons as documented in the alpha "sp" package on 
sourcefourge under "r-spatial", but S3 maptools will continue to be 
supported even when the more robust S4 version is released to CRAN (about 
September/October). Should we try to post a roadmap on sourceforge? - I 
would encourage people to look at "sp" and report your experiences.

Roger
