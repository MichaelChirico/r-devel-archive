Hello,

NOAA's Ocean Prediction Center (https://ocean.weather.gov/) serves the
US Navy's almost-daily estimate of the locations of the north and
south walls of the Gulf Stream in the North Atlantic
(https://ocean.weather.gov/gulf_stream_latest.txt). The also serve an
archive via a FTP server
(https://ftp.opc.ncep.noaa.gov/grids/experimental/GStream) for
downloads by year.  The dataset provides manually estimated of
locations along the so-called north and south walls of the Gulf
Stream, although there is ongoing research and debate about the best
way to define the Gulf Stream. My colleagues and I have been slowly
pulling together a small package to make working with this data easier
(https://github.com/BigelowLab/gstream).

This dataset provides an interesting spatial puzzle because the points
for a specific wall on a given date are not ordered.  Assuming that
the points could be ordered into LINESTRING, the problem is how to do
it.

We probably can use sfnetworks package
(https://luukvdmeer.github.io/sfnetworks/) extensive tools to follow a
shortest path... but first one of the two endpoints must be found.
Eeek! How does one do that programmatically?  The plot attached shows
the points for the north wall on 2020-12-19.  Also shown are the first
and last points in the record which are clearly not the endpoints of a
path we might assemble from the points.

Hi Ben,

I had a bit of fun with this [1]...the act of following a shortest path 
and finding the endpoints are sort of related (in that if you follow the 
shortest path setting a maximum distance threshold, eventually you will 
fail to find any more points, and you've found (maybe) and endpoint!).

I hope this is helpful!

Cheers,

You make it look so easy!  That is just what I was trying to noodle
out.  I need to spend more time digging into the
[s2](https://r-spatial.github.io/s2/index.html) package.  Thank you!

This is a special case of the Travelling Salesman Problem
and you could use the R package 'TSP' for example..

Subject: [R-sig-Geo] simulation envelopes with Kmark(),
 for an inhomogeneous point pattern
Message-ID: <2739a3db-ab45-d2da-19f0-bb27a01f3a53@binghamton.edu>

It's been a while since I've worked with point patterns.

I have a marked point pattern X consisting of household locations, with
the marks being waiting time to get a lab test. I'm interested in the
spatial distribution of those waiting times. Among other exploratory
methods, I'm looking at Kest(), Kinhom(), and Kmark(), all with
simulation envelopes.

Disregarding the marks, certainly the points are not CSR. The center of
our county is urban, the periphery rural.

envelope(X, Kinhom, nsim = 99)  ## not adjusting other arguments, for
sake of discussion

is pretty straightforward, but disregards the marks.

envelope(X, Kmark, nsim = 99)

also seems useful.  But does it address the inhomogeneity of the
locations (considered simply as unmarked points)?

Guess what I'm asking is: Is there an inhomogeneous version of Kmark, or
is it an inevitable part of how Kmark works? Or are these meaningless
questions?

I thought of calculating the (inhomogeneous) density of X first, and
using it to generate the 99 simulated patterns in envelope, like this,
as at top of page 401 in Spatial Point Patterns, Baddeley et al:

D <- density(X)
envelope(X, Kmark, simulate = expression(rpoispp(D)), nsim = 5)  ##
fewer sims while figuring this out

but it produces an error for each attempted simulation:

Error in (function (X, f = NULL, r = NULL, correction = c("isotropic",  :
  is.ppp(X) && is.marked(X) is not TRUE

I think I'm failing to generate the marks in the simulated patterns?

Grateful for any advice.

Thanks.

Subject: [R-sig-Geo] error occured when combining st_sample() with
 raster::extract()
Message-ID: <SA1PR15MB63970B638E81F39D4DCCD7AEB0CB2@SA1PR15MB6397.namprd15.prod.outlook.com>

Dear community,

I am exploring the functionality of raster package by following the online textbook Geocomputation with R, 1st ed. (I know the newer version of the textbook is online, I just want to finish what I left). The problem I encountered is associated with the example from Section 5.4.2, raster extraction:
https://bookdown.org/robinlovelace/geocompr/geometric-operations.html#raster-extraction
When I want to combine it with st_sample() from Section 5.2.3, i.e. extract the pixel values from say 15 randomly chosen locations, I met an error.

Here comes the script:

library(sf)
library(raster)

filename=system.file('raster/srtm.tif', package='spDataLarge')
srtm=raster(filename)
filename=system.file('vector/zion.gpkg', package='spDataLarge')
zion=st_read(filename)
zion=st_transform(zion, projection(srtm))

data('zion_points', package='spDataLarge')
extract(srtm, zion_points) # textbook example, work as expected

sampled_sites=st_sample(zion, 15)
extract(srtm, sampled_sites) # error occurred.

The error message says "????: ??????extract???????x = "RasterLayer", y = "sfc_POINT"?????????????"
There is Chinese text embedded because my OS is in Chinese. Translated into English, it reads "ERROR: function 'extract' labelling ??x = "RasterLayer", y = "sfc_POINT"?? cannot find the inherited methods".

My question: what's the reason of this problem, and how to fix it?

Thank you in advance!

Dear Xiang,

I guess that the reason for the error is that zion_points is an sf 
object, while sampled_sites is an sfc object. You should create a 
0-column sf object from the sfc using function st_as_sf().
Please try the following code:
extract(srtm, st_as_sf(sampled_sites))
