Subject: [R-sig-Geo] Enhance your coding skills for handling geographical
 data!!
Message-ID: <CAKoiDH+67aOCCPqkWrL5W+EiywM+tybHYx7mYBC4KHnHcvYrxA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Colleagues,
there are few seats left for the

*"GEO-OPEN-HACK-2024: Big Geospatial Data Hackathon
with Open Infrastructure and Tools (advance level)" *(
https://iiasa.ac.at/events/jun-2024/geo-open-hack-2024
-big-geospatial-data-hackathon-with-open-infrastructure-and-tools ) with
the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) in
Laxenburg, Austria.

This event will push the geo-computation to the next level, dealing with
HPC and cloud solutions for handling massive geo-data. The hackathon is
designed for on-site attendance and you on-line, nonetheless the on-site
will gain the most from direct interaction with both instructors and the
class peers.

Please forward to announce these opportunities within your network. I wish
to have such courses during my Ph.D.!!

Sincerely,

Giuseppe Amatulli  & the Spatial Ecology Team
