Subject: [R-sig-Geo] How to export a GeoTIFF 8 bit raster

this might work, your file link doesn't provide access to me so I created a
guess example

library(terra)
x <- rast(matrix(sample(0:255, 12), 3))
file.tif <- tempfile(fileext = ".tif")
#writeRaster(x, file.tif, gdal = "NBITS=8", datatype = "INT1U")
#rast(file.tif)

terra has its own controls over the options, some interact/overlap with the
gdal ones I haven't explored that

Hi, I tried to perform *Area-to-Area Regression CoKriging (AtACoK)* for
raster downscaling using the package *atakrig*. My dataset consists of 1
dependent variable with spatial resolution 400m and 2 covariates with 100m
pixel size. After performing  *AtACoK* the resulting raster's image values
are from 0:Infinity (I followed the steps included in the *atakrig*
package). Any ideas why those values? For comparison, when I tried
Area-to-Area Kriging (using 1 independent variable) the downscaled image
was fine. Thank you. Here is the code:

library(atakrig)
library(raster)
library(beepr)

ntl = raster("path/atacok/ntl_nov.tif") #dependent var
ndvi = raster("path/ndvi.tif") #independent var (any combination can be used)
pop = raster("path/pop.tif") #independent var

ntl.d <- discretizeRaster(ntl, 100);
ndvi.d <- discretizeRaster(ndvi, 100);
pop.d <- discretizeRaster(pop, 100);
grid.pred <- discretizeRaster(ndvi, 100, type = "value");

pop.d$areaValues$value <- log(pop.d$areaValues$value)
ntl.d$areaValues$value <- log(ntl.d$areaValues$value)
ndvi.d$areaValues$value <- log(ndvi.d$areaValues$value)
## area-to-area Kriging ----# point-scale variogram from combined ndvi and ntl
aod.combine <- rbindDiscreteArea(ndvi.d, ntl.d)
sv.ok_combine <- deconvPointVgm(aod.combine,
                                model = "Gau",
                                rd = 0.5,
                                maxIter = 20); beep(7)
# point-scale cross-variogram (for AtACoK)
aod.list <-list(ndvi = ndvi.d, ntl = ntl.d, pop = pop.d)sv.ck
<-deconvPointVgmForCoKriging(aod.list,
                                   model = "Exp", #Sph, Exp, Gau
                                   rd = 0.7,
                                   maxIter = 20); beep(7)
# prediction
pred.ataok <- ataKriging(ntl.d,
                         grid.pred,
                         sv.ck$ntl,
                         showProgress = TRUE); beep(7)


pred.atack <- ataCoKriging(aod.list,
                           unknownVarId = "ntl",
                           unknown = grid.pred,
                           ptVgms = sv.ck,
                           oneCondition = F,
                           auxRatioAdj = F,
                           showProgress = T); beep(7)

# convert result to raster
pred.ataok.r <-rasterFromXYZ(pred.ataok[,-1]);
plot(pred.ataok.r)

pred.atack.r <-rasterFromXYZ(pred.atack[,-1]);
plot(pred.atack.r)

Subject: [R-sig-Geo] Request for help on R codes for equivalent QGIS
 operation
Message-ID: <CAEGXkYV4JT-hY67JeFm=EEHcpo-FxA5AGZ+mFq=2+GOc1fsqVg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Everyone,

I have two shapefiles :

shp1 has 400 polygons. One of the columns is X.
shp2 has 10 polygons.

Both have the same extent and crs. I want to summarize the value of column
X from shp1 within the
boundary of each polygons for shp2

Can anyone please suggest to me an equivalent approach in R to join
attributes by location.

I am using the following approach in QGIS:

1) Under Processing Toolbox, select Vector General
2) Join attributes by location (summary)
3) Select shp2 as Input Layer
4) Select shp1 as Join layer
5) Under Geometric properties, select intersects, overlaps,
contains and within
4) Fields to summarizse: select X
5) Summaries to calculate: select sum


I would really appreciate some help or suggestions in this regard.

Thanks,
Bhaskar

Dear Bhaskar,

function st_join() from package 'sf' is what you are searching for. See 
the examples in the help page of the function about the aggregation of 
the spatially joined data:
https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/reference/st_join.html

Hello everyone, 

I have an sf object of multilinestrings (image "Linestrings") that I created by closing the gaps between (black) lines, thereby constructing a new set of (red) lines. I merged the two sets of lines into a multilinestring object and now would like to get the endpoints of every multilinestring. I know that there is the st_line_sample for linestrings, but when I st_cast my multilinestrings to linestrings, the function of course returns every endpoint from every linestring (black and red) that are contained in a mulitlinestring (image "Result_st_line_sample"). 

I grouped the individual linestrings to multilinestrings based on shared endpoints (image "Mulitlinestrings_grouped") but I don't know how to go on from there. I also tried to merge the mulitlinestrings into linestrings in various ways to overcome this issue and tested different approaches to get the endpoints, but nothing worked so far. 

Any help is much appreciated!

Many thanks,
Deborah
