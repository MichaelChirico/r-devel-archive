Hi again,
I took a look at maptools code and shapelib last night. It should not be
hard to modify to create and write 
shapefiles. I think I never developed it in maptools because I never
really thought of R as
being suitable for editing maps. I thought R would be very suitable for
designing cartographic dispays for 
statistical purposes. 

That said, If I can get it working in an evening or two I will submit it
to Roger for inclusion in maptools.
Do any of the other geo interfaces in development write map formats? Eg
the Rgdal interface?

Subject: [R-sig-Geo] Parallelizing  spatial computations
Message-ID: <1078162028.31675.69.camel@chomsky.estadi.uv.es>

Hi,

I have to run lots of simulations based on several spatial scan
statistics. Since the main overhead is due to a call to 'apply' , I 
was wondering whether it could be possible to parallelize this "loop".

I know there are a few packages for parallel computing in R but I don't
know whether it's worth trying them. Have anyone used these packages
before?

I have a linux machine with two 700-MHz processors and 256 Mb RAM. I
know it's not too much, but I hope to save some time by using both
processors.

Thank you in advance.

Hi

Is there a possiblity to estimate classification and regression tree 
models taking spatial dependence into account?
Or are there any viable functions in R to model spatial data with 
ordinal response, e.g. using something like autoregressive error terms?

Thanks for your advice!

Scott Urquhart at Colorado State University (nsu at stat.colostate.edu)
developed with a student a pre-whitening approach to handling spatial
dependence in regression trees.  There are a set of R/Splus functions
that I believe are available.  If you contact him and decide that you
want to use these, and he doesn't have them, I think I can find them.

Said to be ready by about useR! in Vienna in May. Maybe other parts of the 
connector work better - I've put a zip archive on:

http://spatial.nhh.no/R/stag/R_ArcGIS_example.zip

with R_ArcGIS_example.frm and R_ArcGIS_example.frx in it. This 
demonstrates and times moving a band from a raster (add a jpeg to an 
empty map in ArcMap) to R, returning the log of data+1. This was 
originally written by Helge Astad, and the timings show it goes fast once 
R is started.

Should we try to start a repository of *.frm/*.frx forms as demos 
somewhere? Learning from examples seems to be a good way forward?

I think you are correct in principle, but I can see situations where 
people want to export subsets of say polygons, lines, or points.

That's very generous - if you can make a first attempt at making your code 
work, that will give us a start. The places where my head ached were 
whether we need to check shapes for compliance before writing them to file 
- but maybe shapelib does that - I don't think so? Should we just let 
people write anyway?

It should but doesn't - you can (I think) overwrite bands, but this is 
something that needs fixing - for those interested, rgdal is on 
sourceforge, so checking out under cvs is possible, so that improvements 
and additions can be brought in under control.

Hi Roger,
Just working on it now. Just created an empty shapefile from R
complete with segmentation fault :)
debugging it now.

I think the code in shapelib, shprewind, is an example of using 
the shapelib api to do shape checking. I will follow this up further.
meanwhile i will work on getting something started.

Hi, there.

Import of point data in shape file seems to be fine with maptools.
There is no problem to plot the points with plot(Map.object), but I do
not know how to extract xy coordinates of points from Map.object for
overlying on another polygon map.

Thank you

Map2points() ?

The function returns a matrix with a maplim attribute for its bounding 
box, and class "Mappoints".

Dear list members:

    I was using the function localmoran.sad() in SPDEP package. Since I am
interested in the calculation of the star shaped weight list (Vi) of each
location, I set the save.Vi = TRUE. However, after I obtained the
saddlepoing approximated local Moran's I object (say, locmsad), the result
I got from using locmsad[[1]]$Vi is always "NULL". Does anybody have any
idea what I have done wrong? Thanks in advance.

There is a bug in the code. It will be removed in the next update. For now 
edit the code in localmoran.sad() (in mtlocalmoran.R in the source 
package, line 105) or a local copy (myfun <- edit(localmoran.sad)):

is: if (save.Vi) {Vi = Vi}

should be: Vi = if(save.Vi) Vi else NULL

which returns Vi if save.Vi is TRUE.

Subject: [R-sig-Geo] New package: DCluster
Message-ID: <1078931928.2622.36.camel@chomsky.estadi.uv.es>

Dear R users,

I am glad to announce the release of a new package for R: DCluster. It
implements a number of methods for the detection of clusters of disease.
It includes methods to test Poisson extra-variation (Chi-square test and
Potthoff-Whittinghill's test), Spatial Autocorrelation (Moran's I and
Geary's c), general clustering (Whittermore's statistic and Tango's
statistic), scan methods (Openshaw's GAM, Besag & Newell's methods and
Kulldorff & Nagarwalla's statistic) and a focused test (Stone's Test).

Bootstrap is used to estimate significance and a number of models are
proposed to simulate data: permutations and Poisson, Multinomial or Neg.
Binomial distributions.

I hope the package will be useful to epidemiologists and statisticians
involved in spatial epidemiological studies. As usual, feedback and
comments are welcome. Our hope is to improve the package, so suggestions
about new methods to be added are of interest.

With best regards,
