Subject: [R-sig-Geo] longitudinal data model with spatial correlation
Message-ID: <000701c43507$bb91bc30$a200a8c0@Lepc204>

Dear R users,

I would like to estimate a multivariate space-time series with the following
structure.

Dependent variable: rate of self-employment on region i at time t;

Covariates are: a set of economic (i.e. rate of unemployment, rate of
unemployment squared, sectoral composition) and demographic characteristics
(i.e. gender distribution, proportion of ethnical minorities, educational
level) of region i at time t-1.

The main factor of interest is the relationship between the rate of
unemployment of any given region at period t-1 and the level of
self-employment at period t. The hypothesis being tested is if individuals
are pushed of pulled into self-employment.

I'm using regional data from 100 different counties in the UK (i=100) as my
geographical units (I have both the shape file with the boundaries of this
regions and the centroids for each one of them). And I have over 11 years of
quarterly data (t=46). I've used the spdep package to run a few
cross-section models with spatial auto-correlation, but I would really like
to explore the longitudinal aspect of my dataset.

I would like to know if  you might have any idea of how I could set up a
space-time model using R commands. Any references and/or suggestions will be
more than welcomed.

All the very best,

Joao Pedro

Dear R colleagues,

My name is Jose Hernandez and work in the analysis of on-farm experiments.

I've been a R user for sometime now, however am still struggling figuring 
out some of my spatial analysis using R.

Most of my experiments have the following model:

Y_ij = Mu + r_i + T_j + e_ij

Where:
r_i is some replication and T_j some fixed treatment effect.

I many cases there is significant within block heterogeneity and therefore 
I can't assume that e_ij are iid.

An alternative is to use:

Y_ij = Mu + T_j + e_ij

And assume that:

e_ij follows some spatial covariance model such as exponential, spherical, etc.


Are there any R packages that will integrate spatial variability into the 
model ?

Thanks and advance and best regards !

Jose

Hi Jose
The function likfit() in the package geoR will fit those models.
Actually there is a data-set in the package with a similar structure
see:

require(geoR)
data(hoef)
help(hoef)

best
P.J.

Paulo

I think you need to provide a few more details here about how to fit 
those models using your function in geoR.
* note the r_i term, which means that the replications have different 
means. How would you specify this in your function ?
* I Assume the quantity of interest are the contrasts in T_j. Guess some 
manual fiddling is needed to obtain confidence intervals for these 
contrast ?

Alternatively, since the model is a multivariate Guassian, so it is 
definetely possible to do inference by figuring out what the mean vector 
and covariance matrix of the vector Y={Y_ij | i,j= ....} looks like, 
write down the likelihood function and use the nlm or optim function for 
maximising it.

Best regards Ole

Jose, I think package nlme can deal with such models as well, and
it may be slightly more oriented towards the analysis of experiments
than geoR is, please correct me if I'm wrong.

Hello.

 I've tried to run example(gwr.whole.test).

 I've got following errors.

gwr.whole.test(col.gauss)
Loading required package: ctest
Test of GWR model called as:

See ?Defunct.
In addition: Warning messages:

2: NA/Inf replaced by maximum positive value
3: package 'ctest' has been merged into 'stats'

 Could you teach me how to resolve this?

Hi, Hisaji ONO:
    Just an add-on. Since the warning message indicates that package 'mva'
and 'ctest' have been merged into 'stats', when you are altering the
source code, you can also replace all 'mva' and 'ctest' with 'stats'.

Hi, Hisaji ONO:

    I think the error message actually just indicates that the function
print.coefmat() that has been called in the gwr.whole.test() is no longer
part of R (you can find this infomation by using ?Defunct in R).
    From the ?Defunct you can also find that the print.coefmat() function
is an older name for 'printCoefmat' with a different default for
'na.print'. I therefore replaced all the print.coefmat in the source code
of spgwr with printCoefmat, and the program gives the correct responses. 
    Wish this help.

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0405182243240.18147-100000@reclus.nhh.no>

I would like to announce the release of new maptools and spdep revisions. 

I would also like to suggest that users consider thinking through 
upgrading before actually doing so - the internal representation of 
polylist objects changes in this release of maptools, ramping up towards 
the introduction of new-style classes later this year. 

The release tries to work out how to handle plot order and holes in
relation to the many shapefiles "in the wild" that do not follow ESRI
recommendations about holes having counterclockwise ring direction. This
means that both Map2poly() and plot.polylist() may give warnings that were
not there before. On the other hand, a major weakness of plot.polylist()
has been removed - it could overplot internal polygons without warning,
giving the wrong colour in choropleth maps - this should no longer happen
in polylists created using the new Map2poly from shapefiles.

Please contact me directly or via this list if things go wrong (or at
useR! in Vienna), I have tried to test the maptools release on difficult
shapefiles, but I am sure there are stranger shapefiles around than I've
seen yet.

spdep code for constructing neighbour objects from polylists has been 
rewritten in C, and should be faster and less memory-intensive.

I am told that it will be resolved after useR! 2004 - the automatic 
generation of Windows binaries was defeated by the simultaneous updating 
of both maptools and spdep. I can try to put up interim versions on my own 
server from Vienna tomorrow, but I think Uwe Ligges, who does an excellent 
and difficult jib supporting us with W32 binaries, will fix this on Monday 
or latest Tuesday CET.

mat2listw(<your matrix>)$neighbours should do it.

I'll add this to the documentation TODO - are vignettes or regular help

This will be happening, as of now in relation to the "sp" package on 
sourceforge, but it hasn't happened yet. Keeping the region names 
associated with the polygons is essential, and knowing when to use 
multi-polygons (how many polygons make up a region) too, so there is 
plenty to do -- help welcome!

I have been working with the Windows package build expert Uwe Ligges, and 
we hope things will now stabilise - a new source package for spdep 
(0.2-18) is now on CRAN, and we will see how tonight's automatic build for 
Windows goes. Note that older versions are preserved under the R release 
number directories, in a directory called "last", so that the Windows 
binary for 0.2-12 is at:

http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/contrib/1.8/last/spdep_0.2-12.zip

The check status of Windows binaries is tabulated on:

http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/contrib/checkSummaryWin.html

with links to information if there are problems. Uwe and I hope that this 
issue has been resolved, but it has been very difficult to find with 
certainty.

Since there were questions on this list about using SJava, this post by 
Duncan Temple Lang on r-help should be of use in understanding the current 
status of the package.

Subject: Re: [R] any simple examples for SJAVA please


The SJava package is a very flexible and general bidirectional
interface between R and Java that can allow not only 
simple data and complex data structures to be passed between
the languages, but also references to objects
including using R functions as Java methods.  Other approaches
to inter-system interfaces are much simpler and direct
but as  a result are more limited for general computation.
There is a great deal of infrastructure under SJava that makes
it a general Java interpreter. 
And building a variety of different communication mechanisms
to R really ignores the existng literature  in the subject.

Unfortunately, there are more opinions about the SJava
package than people who actually understand the issues.
At the moment, what is a real problem is that 
there isn't a significant culture for people
to help package authors distribute Windows binaries,
but more that Windows users require software
without any additional effort.
Unfortunately, I do not have the time to keep my Windows machine upgraded for service
packages, virus software, etc. simply to create binaries for
Windows users that I currently do not need.   

I would be very happy to work with someone who uses Windows
and wanted to take on providing binaries. I can 
both explain and simplify the build process
(dropping the support for S-Plus).  But it is prohibitive
to spend all my time supporting the Omegahat packages and R  on numerous platforms
while still doing research so that people have fresh ideas in 5 years time.
There is a real danger that statistical computing research will become
bogged down servicing currrent needs of users and extending 
concepts that were research topics 20 years ago  rather than
working on new concepts that will needed for the future.

So I am hoping that one or more people can volunteer to 
help with maintaining the Windows port.
It is definitely not trivial as the SJava package is more complex
in nature (and implemenation) than  many others, but it is 
feasible.
