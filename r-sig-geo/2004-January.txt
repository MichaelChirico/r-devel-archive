Dear Edzer,

Happy New Year!

I'm just muddling, but would it be OK to try to put my proj4R CRS class in 
SpatialCls for proj4string? This may mean setting proj4string as NA until 
the CRS has been set, and as.projected as NULL until proj4string is 
identified as latlong or !latlong? How should we handle this with regard 
to commiting to sourceforge, is this a situation where I need to do this 
locally, and send you a tarball to avoid introducing changes you'd prefer 
not to have?

A little question - does coordinates() preserve sdf row names as a way of 
keeping point IDs stuck to both objects?

I'm a bit worried about holes too in the polygon setting, the original
compiled code in maptools for finding ring direction seems buggy, and ring
direction seems to be a typical way of flagging holes as against
boundaries for fill.

Best wishes,

Roger

  Typical it may be, but I think its the wrong way of doing things! This 
sort of complex geometry would be better represented as a tree of rings. 
  Each ring may have child rings that represent islands or holes within 
the parent (depending on whether the parent is a hole or an island). In 
this way both the island/hole nature is preserved as well as the way 
each is embedded in the other.

  I think you can reconstruct this tree from the rings+holeflag form, 
but it involves doing point-in-poly tests using generated points 
guaranteed to be in a given ring.

  The tree structure leads to nice simple calculation of various 
properties of the rings. Consider a lake with islands with perhaps lakes 
- the area of water of the outer lake is the area(lake ring) minus 
area(child rings), whereas the amount of water within the outer lake is 
area(lake ring) minus amount of water within(child rings), a neat 
tree-based algorithm.

  Given that the tree can be reconstructed from the ring+holeflag 
representation, I'd settle for that if a method for constructing the 
tree is made available.

  Of course in an object-oriented sense, the users shouldn't see the 
representation - there shouldn't be a method for 'area' that returns a 
negative number if the thing is a hole - there should be an 
'isHole(x,y)' method or similar...

  Anyone notice a typo in a recent R-news posting that referred to 
'objection orientation' :)

If filling is the main concern, then it may not matter (which direction
inner polygons are recorded).  If, in this script,

p <- c(
  1,1,
  8,1,
  8,8,
  1,8,
  1,1,
      2,2,
      7,2,
      7,7,
      2,7,
      2,2,
  1,1,
          3,3,
          6,3,
          6,6,
          3,6,
          3,3,
  1,1,
              4,4,
              5,4,
              5,5,
              4,5,
              4,4,
  1,1,
  NA,NA)
p <- matrix (p, nrow=2, ncol=length(p)/2)
plot (p[1,], p[2,], type="n", axes=FALSE, xlab="", ylab="")
polygon (p[1,], p[2,], col=1)

the directions of the successive inner polygons are reversed, the
graphic result is the same.  The fill algorithm evidently uses the
parity feature (fill on, fill off, while crossing successive boundaries
in the direction of shading).  The diagonal line showing from (2,2) to
(3,3) is another matter.  I wrote Paul Murrell about this a couple of
years ago and he referred me to Ross Ihaka who, Paul said, was working
on new polygon routines.

For topological applications, the tree structure suggested by Barry
Rowlingson seems like an elegant method.

Hi Roger,
I thought I fixed the polygon direction code, but I may not have worked
it in to the version
I passed over to you. Sorry. I rember that the original code that came
with the shapelib library
in the contrib section did not work properly, and gave screwy results. I
remember replacing it with an algorithm from O'Rourke (Comp Geom in C)
that worked much better. Let me look in my backups (I think that was 3
computers and 2 jobs ago) and compare with the current maptools. If I
didn't work it in I will send you the code.

I think Barry's idea is great and not hard to implement. Essentially he
is suggesting to store the polygons  ' parts in a red-black tree. You can
refrence the polygon parts by id's and just suck them right out of the
array when plotting.

Please go ahead and commit; that's the idea of you being a developer.
The idea of using cvs is that you can go back to previous versions.

Yes; it returns a data frame with only the (2 or 3) coordinate columns

Hi, members

I'm Marcelo, oceanographer from Brazil
and actually work with fishery acoustical data
of brazilian shelf. I'm using R, GMT, ArcView (windows)
in Linux redhat 9.0 (Athlon Xp 1.6Ghz, 20Gb 540mb mem).
I run kriging analysis using gstat (R1.8.1) in
fishery acoustic data:

x     y     sa (backscatering acoustic parameter)

the output is ordinary kriging surface.
I need overlap these output to a map of
Brazil coastal shelf and slope but i don't
make this. I have a file (ascii) of Brazil coastal,
and shapefile. Someone can helps me with this
problem? I try in gimp, kpaint and others but i
need a better solution to learn more in R.

Thanks in advance!

Hi Marcelo,

If you have everything on the same coordenate system you can just plot
the Brasilian coast with plot(..., type="l") and add kriging surface
with points or something similar.

Hope this helps

Hello, Professor Bivand.

Currently I summaries GWR using Fotheringham et al. 's GWR book(Wiley).

Although current spgwr has no support of adaptive spatial kernel, I'd like
to add this kernel in it.

But for me it's not enough to implement this only reading page 46's footnote
in this books

Could you give any hint for implementing adaptive spatial kernel to me?

 Regards.

Hi, Mr. Hisaji Ono and all:

    I think Fortheringham and collegues are using the cross-validation to
obtain an optimal number of nearest neighbor to replace the optimal
bandwidth. This way, every data point will have the same number of
observations participating the locally weighted regression.
    I cannot actually implement the code in R myself, but I would like to
list my understanding of using the cross-validation procedure to obtain
the optimal number of nearest neighbors. If I am wrong in any aspect,
please correct me:
    1. Choose the weighting scheme (bi-squre, or similar ones like
tri-cube);
    2. Set the minimum number of nearest neighbor as the number of
explanatory variables plus 2, and the maximum number as the number of
observations (I guess for large number of observations, this may be very
computational intensive);
    3. Loop through the minimum to the maximum, and obtain a CV score for
each number of nearest neighbor;
    4. The smallest CV yields the optimal number of nearest neighbor.

    I hope this will help.

When Chris Brunsdon and I were in Lucca last September, some coding was
done, although it isn't yet ready for release. Some more work needs to
be done, also to introduce geographically weighted statistical summary
measures. The code does include the k-nearest neighbours adaptive kernel
used in GWR in some cases. If others would like to join in, I could
start a sourceforge project if you like.

Mmm, yeah, the trouble is that R is not a GIS, and
GMT and ArcView are no statistics packages.

I think you can import shapefiles using packages
maptools, and perhaps Rmap (not on CRAN?).
I imaging you can then plot the values with

image(values.krige)

and add polygons to the plot with the plot
commands in maptools, using the add=TRUE
argument.

levelplot, which I like much more because it
draws a legend, can currently not do this
easily (i.e., without customizing panel functions);
has anyone looked into this?

Hi.

 Against images imported by RGDAL, can R execute?Tomlin's Map Algebra or
Cartographic
Modelling(http://mutate.echiron.com/doc_center/library/pcraster/x30.htm)?

 Regards.

Cell by cell operations would work, because then you don't need to know
where you are. Any other operations do need to know, and wouldn't work
without functions being written. Maybe these are best handled in GIS - you
refer to PCRaster, which is downloadable, although closed source, for
Windows. GRASS is a cross-platform alternative, and its r.mapcalc gets you
a long way - my choice would be to write a wrapper to convert the image to
the structure needed to output to a GRASS raster, and do the work there.
Perhaps it would help to be able to create a new GRASS LOCATION from
within R running within GRASS?
