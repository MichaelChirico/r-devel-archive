Subject: [R-sig-Geo] geolocating image with info of other image
Message-ID: <BN6PR22MB0132840D5038894CC10DE1A3A62C9@BN6PR22MB0132.namprd22.prod.outlook.com>

Hi! I am trying to use the geolocation information of a tiff image to geolocate another. Both images are frames from the same drone footage, with the drone still over the same position. The one geolocated is a tif and the one to geolocate is a png, and it is to be converted to a tif. However, when I open the new tif in Google Earth Engine, I got it where I want it, but its almost all white. I have also noticed that the stack created from the original .png has a fourth layer that should not be there, all of it at maximum spectral value of 255. Do you know hwat might be going on? I have also tried with the first image not as a png but as a tif without geolocation and the same happened. I have also tried with bricks instead of stacks. I tried first with rasters, but the result was even worse. All the image was white. Here is my code:

library(raster)
library(rgdal)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

## Loading image of interest as raster
R_test <-
  stack("Pt6_clear.png")
R_test ## It does not have any CRS
plot(R_test)


## Loading image already geolocated from GIS
frame2 <-
  stack("Pt6_frame2.tif")
frame2 ##
plot(frame2)
# Give image of interest the lat/lon coords of the geolocated image as appear in its metadata in the console
extent(R_test) <- c(-9073461, -9073269, 2974255, 2974366)
# Copy the projection data of the geolocated image as appears in the console to the image of interest
projection(R_test) <- CRS("+proj=merc +lat_ts=0 +lon_0=0 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs")
plot(R_test)

## Write new geolocated image into a file
writeRaster(R_test, "R_test_geolocated.tif", format = "GTiff")

Subject: [R-sig-Geo] Seeking help implementing nb2listwdist() to find
 inverse distance matrix.
Message-ID: <YQXPR0101MB1176B82961DCFD4C23129CD1C02B9@YQXPR0101MB1176.CANPRD01.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Hello,

I am attempting to write R code for the spdep package to reproduce the Moran's I for point data examples found in David Ebdon (1985) Statistics In Geography?, 2nd Edition on pages 161-162, Table 7.11

I am unable to implement the nb2listdist() operation to make an inverse distance weighted matrix. Some of what follows is a solution posted by Dr. Bivand using a slightly different approach ( https://r.789695.n4.nabble.com/troubles-performing-Moran-I-test-td878799.html ). While I have a solution, I still want to also figure out how to use nb2listdistw, too. The relevant part of my code is:

############################
id <- c("A","B","C","D","E")
x <- c(2,1,3,4,5)
y <- c(5,4,2,1,1)
z <- c(8,5,10,42,20)

## Create inverse distance matrix using boring math.
dij.matrix <- as.matrix(dist(cbind(x, y)))
inv.dij.matrix <- 1/dij.matrix
diag(inv.dij.matrix) <- 0

install.packages(  "spdep",
  "sp",   dependencies = TRUE  )
library(spdep)
library(sp)

## create sparse matrix for spdep::Moran.test
lw <- mat2listw(inv.dij.matrix)
lwW2 <- nb2listw(lw$neighbours, glist=lw$weights, style="raw")

## calculate Moran's I assuming Normality.
moran.test(z, lwW2, randomisation = FALSE, alternative = "two.sided")

# Everything works! It also mirrors Ebdon's result.

## Create inverse distance matrix using spdep::nb2listwdist
arf <- mat2listw(dij.matrix)
arf2  <- nb2listwdist( arf$neighbours,  z, type = "idw",  style = "raw", longlat = NULL)

## Calculate Moran's I again.
moran.test(z, arf, randomisation = FALSE, alternative = "two.sided")

######################

Sadly, when I run arf2  <- nb2listwdist( arf$neighbours,  z, type = "idw",  style = "raw", longlat = NULL), I get this error message:

 Error in UseMethod("st_coordinates") :
  no applicable method for 'st_coordinates' applied to an object of class "c('double', 'numeric')"

I have found nothing on Google, Stack Exchange, or R-Help to help. So far, manually digging through this newsgroup has turned nothing up. Any help is greatly appreciated.

This cannot work as there is no style "raw". I guess you mean "B".

With

lwW2 <- nb2listw(lw$neighbours, glist=lw$weights, style="B")

> moran.test(z, lwW2, randomisation = FALSE, alternative = "two.sided")

 	Moran I test under normality

data:  z
weights: lwW2

Moran I statistic standard deviate = 0.91961, p-value = 0.3578
alternative hypothesis: two.sided
sample estimates:
Moran I statistic       Expectation          Variance
       -0.08248781       -0.25000000        0.03318058

If you name the arguments, you see that you are missing x (an 'sp' 'sf', 
or 'sfc' object) and passing the variable under analysis z, not the 
points.

> arf2  <- nb2listwdist( arf$neighbours,  x=SpatialPoints(cbind(x, y)), 
type = "idw",  style = "raw")
> moran.test(z, arf2, randomisation = FALSE, alternative = "two.sided")

 	Moran I test under normality

data:  z
weights: arf2

Moran I statistic standard deviate = 0.91961, p-value = 0.3578
alternative hypothesis: two.sided
sample estimates:
Moran I statistic       Expectation          Variance
       -0.08248781       -0.25000000        0.03318058

which looks the same to me.

Hope this helps,

Roger

Hi! I have found a way to give a png the CRS and location of a geolocated tiff, and to convert the png to tiff. Now I have to apply it to different pngs in the same folder (all named Pt6_frame1, Pt6_frame2, etc) and write the individual new tiff files as Pt6_frame1_geolocated, Pt6_frame2_geolocated, etc. Does anyone have an idea of how to do so? I have tried the code in various posts, using for loops and functions, but I get various errors. Thanks.

**## Loading image of interest as stack**

R_test <-
  stack("Pt6_clear.png")

**# Give image of interest the lat/lon coords of the geolocated image as appear in its metadata in the console**

extent(R_test) <- c(-9073461, -9073269, 2974255, 2974366)

**# Copy the projection data of the geolocated image as appears in the console to the image of interest**

Perhaps you could try using the function 'av_video_images' from the

Dear

I am Bibi, a PhD student of Environmental Science in South Korea.  I am
currently writing my research paper and to deal with data I need to do Self
Organizing Map (SOM).

I am using R version 4.1.0 (2021-05-18) with kohonen package version
?3.0.10?.

I was following this tutorial given
http://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/437468_136a369149e24f24a4d0c152860ab4c3.html
.

But I have a small issue . To check the efficiency of SOM model, I need to
find out topographic error, which I could not figure out.

I will be really thankful if you please tell me how I can calculate
topographic error or any alternative term or which is used the topographic
error or what is topographic error as for example the quantization error is
"Mean distance to the closest unit in the map".

Is there anything like this for topographic error too?

Please accept my apology if I wrote or mentioned something inappropriate.

Looking forward to hearing back.

Kind regards

Bibi
