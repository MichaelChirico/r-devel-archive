Subject: [R-sig-Geo] Using Confidence Intervals for Visual Testing - free
 seminars
Message-ID: <0qF_pF9RSkuc4hhXh_svtw@geopod-ismtpd-15>

Hi everyone

Instats is pleased to be offering free seminars on Using Confidence Intervals for Visual Testing for R (Oct 25) and Stata (Nov 1), with professor David Armstrong from the University of Western Ontario:

https://instats.org/seminar/using-confidence-intervals-for-visual-testing-in-r-2248

https://instats.org/seminar/using-confidence-intervals-for-visual-testing-in-s-2166

Confidence intervals and visualizations of them are common in the presentation of statistical results. Since their invention in the 1930's, researchers have recognized that readers will try to make inferences comparing estimates by evaluating whether confidence intervals overlap. A long line of research has discussed the pitfalls of this and attempted to build inferences around the probability that confidence intervals overlap under the null hypothesis - essentially burdening the visual display with an additional hypothesis testing function. To improve on this, these seminars will explore new visual tools that allow researchers to understand the precision of their estimates and to visually compare different groups or conditions in a meaningful and statistically defensible way. Designed for researchers across many disciplines, this workshop will equip participants with the expertise needed to leverage confidence intervals effectively using R and Stata.

Instats is also offering free seminars on Switching from SPSS to R <https://instats.org/seminar/switching-from-spss-to-r-free-2-hour-se2> (Nov 5) and Efficient Programming in R <https://instats.org/seminar/efficient-programming-using-r-free-semi2> (Jan 27). We look forward to seeing you there!

Subject: [R-sig-Geo] EVEREST project proposal - PhD student offer (Spain)
Message-ID: <CAKgwV9kvqOpz7fhE5uB-DUYfqUpwmum5qGWXZ-2z6QPgmQDhjg@mail.gmail.com>

Within the EVEREST project (Essential Variables for the rEmote
characterisation and monitoRing of mountain EcosystemS along a
biogeographical gradienT: from data to decision making)*

We offer a 4-years PhD (FPI) position at the Sciences Faculty
(University of Granada).

Objectives

The goal of EVEREST is to sit together managers and scientists in the
co-design, co-production and validation of a common methodological
framework to provide scientifically sound and managerially meaningful
remote sensing variables, as well as monitoring and modeling
capabilities to report on the conservation status of species and
habitats (Habitats Directive), on water quality parameters (Water
Framework Directive), and on ecosystem recovery and resilience after
disturbances and restoration measures (Nature Restoration Law).
EVEREST will identify and provide relevant ecosystem compositional,
structural and functional attributes for these aims in mountain
ecosystems.

Tasks to be performed

Stakeholders engagement; Identification of essential compositional,
structural and functional variables and metrics; Characterisation of
reference dynamics, spatial variability, temporal trends and
anomalies; Mapping species and habitats of community importance and
monitoring their conservation status; Monitoring water quality of
high-mountain lakes; Monitoring ecosystem recovery after disturbances
and evaluation of restoration measurements; Decision support tool for
protected area managers; Scientific and social dissemination of
project results and reporting.

Education requirements

Any MSc degree in Biological or Environmental Sciences, Data or
Computer Sciences, Remote Sensing, Geography or Geographical
Information Systems.

Courses on data science, GIS, remote sensing, ecology, ecological
modeling, machine learning, multivariate analysis, programming
languages, Google Earth Engine, Python, R, JavaScript.

Languages

English (CEFR: C1 or C2)

Previous professional experience

Collaboration in national and international basic and applied research
projects related to environmental monitoring through remote sensors.
Experience on reporting obligations on the Water Framework Directive,
Habitats Directive or the Nature Restoration Law.

We will also value:

Publications (research papers, conference proceedings, books or book
chapters, reports)
Academic record
Motivation letter
References by established academic researchers
Grants and research contracts
Research internships
Teaching experience
Driving license
Fieldwork experience
Organization of (or participation in) participatory workshops
Motivation for scientific research and conservation science
Teamwork and proactive skills
Availability to travel abroad for conferences and research stays

*Project summary: EVEREST brings managers and scientists together to
codesign, coproduce and validate a common platform to provide
scientifically sound and managerially meaningful variables from remote
sensing (RS), together with field data and modeling, to report on 3
European regulations: conservation status of species and habitats
(Habitats Directive), water quality monitoring (Water Framework
Directive), and ecosystem recovery and resilience following
disturbances and restoration (Nature Restoration Law). EVEREST uses 8
mountain national parks (MNPs) across 4 biogeographical regions (Spain
and Portugal) as a proof of the advantages of fusing RS with
artificial intelligence, public datasets, modeling tools, and
ground-truth data to support ecological studies, biodiversity
conservation, and effective management. EVEREST will also test
ecological hypotheses like whether warming and aridification, which
may respectively lengthen or shorten the growing season, are
differentially affecting mountain ecosystems, so that mountains with a
more temperate and rainy summers are less affected than mountains with
hotter and drier summers. EVEREST has 5 specific objectives: 1) To
create a science-policy group that fosters collaboration between
researchers, managers, and decision-makers to ensure that the
project's outcomes align with real-world needs and facilitate the
actual adoption and long-term use of the monitoring platform
developed; 2) To identify and implement essential RS variables and
metrics relevant for EU reporting obligations. 3) To characterize the
reference dynamics, spatial variability, and temporal changes of such
variables and metrics, which provides insights into the functioning
and resilience of mountain ecosystems across gradients; 4) To test and
validate with local researchers and managers the performance of such
variables and metrics by using expert knowledge, public data and
ground-truth data recorded in each MNP; 5) To provide a near-real time
online tool for the exploitation of the project results by three types
of users: scientists, managers and citizenship, with guidelines for
decision making, management and public awareness. EVEREST involves
stakeholder engagement through workshops and collaboration with
managers, researchers, and environmental institutions to promote
adaptive management and use-inspired research. It uses RS, existing
field data, artificial intelligence and modeling to generate
scientific knowledge and practical tools for conservation and
management. EVEREST contributes to international biodiversity
monitoring initiatives and provides guidelines for preserving and
managing high-mountain ecosystems. EVEREST?s social and economic
impacts also include enhanced adaptive management practices, a
user-friendly approach to high-tech tools and biodiversity data, and
increased awareness of mountain values, threats and trends among
society. Outcomes will be disseminated through scientific
publications, conferences, training activities, and online public
platforms nationally and internationally recognized, like OAPN, GEOBON
and LifeWatch, which have members in this proposal. By promoting
international collaboration and knowledge transfer, the project aims
to contribute to the conservation and sustainable management of
mountain ecosystems and the Nature Positive Journey and Nature Based
Solutions in Europe and beyond.

Hi all,
We have only 2 seats left for our upcoming online course "Reproducibility Data Analysis with R" running next week (28-31 October)!
 
This course will teach you how to make your R projects fully reproducible, ensuring that your code runs smoothly across different machines and collaborators. You?ll learn to organise projects, manage environments, use RMarkdown/Quarto and renv, track changes with Git, and even create containers with Docker.
 
Course website: https://www.physalia-courses.org/courses-workshops/r-reproducibility/
 
Who is it for?
If you use R to generate reports and want to collaborate more effectively with others (or your future self!), this course is for you. Basic experience with R is recommended.
 
Daily Schedule:
9 am - 12 pm (Berlin time): Live lectures, coding, and exercises.
 
 
 
Best regards,
Carlo
