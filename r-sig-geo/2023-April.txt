The third report on the R-spatial evolution project has been published. It 
links back to earlier blogs and presentations, and focusses on work that 
maintainers of R packages and workflows using rgdal, rgeos and maptools 
need to put in train now.

The first changes will occur in June 2023, and the retiring packages will 
be archived during October 2023. If you are giving a workshop or tutorial 
during the Northern hemisphere summer, aim for June.

Subject: [R-sig-Geo] differences between risk() in sparr package,
 and relrisk() in spatstat
Message-ID: <CAM+rpY=7P0Yzy311ssvm5mCBRBHL0bsKxABfKzAaAgQpFNqbhQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello. I have a multi-type point pattern, a ppp object in spatstat, with
two types, cases and controls. About 2600 point altogether. Overall, about
2% are cases. All in a polygonal window.  I'm interested in the spatially
varying relative risk of being a case rather than a control. I'm aware of
the relrisk() command in spatstat, and also the risk() command in the sparr
package, both of which take a ppp object as an argument. I've done it with
both. They yield essentially similar pixel images, except that the range of
the relative risk, as shown in the colored legend, is very different in the
two plots.

plot(relrisk(thin.ems.ppp, at = "pixels", weights = NULL, varcov = NULL,
relative=TRUE, adjust=1, edge=TRUE, diggle=TRUE, se=FALSE,
casecontrol=TRUE, case = "case"))

yields relative risks ranging from 0 to about 0.16

In contrast,

risk(thin.ems.ppp, log = FALSE, verbose = TRUE, doplot = TRUE)

yields an image with relative risks ranging from 0 to about 40.

I've read the documentation for the packages, but perhaps I am still
misunderstanding what each package means by "relative risk."  Can anyone
comment?

Thanks

Dear all,

I am using the country-level shapefile from GADM. I would like to merge
Cyprus and North Cyprus into one polygon. Is this possible? I am using
rgdal to read the shapefile, subset, and then rewrite it. Any help will be
highly appreciated.

Hi,

You might try st_union() from the sf package

fwiw, a method with geodata/terra

cyp <- geodata::gadm(country = c("CYP", "XNC"), path = tempdir(), version =
"3.6")

terra::aggregate(cyp)

see ?terra::writeVector to write it out

(rgdal is very old and you should abandon it, it will be removed from
support by the end of this year)


(just as an aside, we can't hit the geodata vector urls directly with gdal
as we can with the rasters, as they are in an R specific format)

Cheers, Mike

I have asked the maintainer of the sparr package (Tilman Davies) about
this issue, and after a bit of to-ing and fro-ing this is what has
turned up.

The basic reason for the discrepancy is the somewhat perplexing fact
that ?relrisk? computes the ratio of intensities, but ?risk? computes
the ratio of densities.  I'm afraid that I can give you no insight in
respect of the intuitive interpretation of the two forms of "relative
risk".

Another, less fundamental, problem is that the default bandwidths
differ between the two functions.  To get consistent results, these
bandwidths need to be set.  (It is not entirely clear from the help,
to go about doing so.)

The following example, provided by Tilman, will provide you with some
guidance:

library(sparr)
data(pbc)
cas <- split(pbc)[[1]]
con <- split(pbc)[[2]]

# Using risk() with the "bandwidth" (the standard deviation of the
# kernel density estimator) set equal to 3 (h0 = 3).
r1  <- risk(cas,con,h0=3,log=FALSE)$rr

# "Raw" calculation, imitating what risk() does, i.e.
# using a ratio of densities.
fhat <- density.ppp(cas,sigma=3)
ghat <- density.ppp(con,sigma=3)
r2   <- (fhat/integral(fhat))/(ghat/integral(ghat))

# Using relrisk() with the "bandwidth" set equal to 3 (sigma = 3).
# Note the difference in argument names and the fact that we have to
# specify "relative=TRUE" (see the help for relrisk as well as having
# to specify which mark corresponds to the "control"
r3 <- relrisk(pbc,sigma=3,relative=TRUE,control=2)

# "Raw" calculation, imitating what relrisk() does, i.e.
# using a ratio of intensities.
r4 <- fhat/ghat

# Now view the results.
plot(anylist(risk=r1,risk.raw=r2,relrisk=r3,
    relrisk.raw=r4),nrows=2,main="")

All is in harmony!  OMMMMMMMMMM!

Hope this helps.

cheers,

Rolf Turner

Thank you! Yes, sp will by default switch to using sf in place of rgdal 
for creating "CRS" objects, and under sp::spTransform in June, and all 
three retiring packages rgdal, rgeos, and maptools will be gone by October 
2023. An sp release will appear in May with a transition guide.

It seems that terra does not have an object corresponding to sp's "CRS" or 
sf's "crs". As far as I can see, one needs to create an empty 
SpatVector/SpatRaster object and assign a CRS, coerce to "Spatial", and 
extract its slot. If this makes sense, sp could use terra (and 
raster, needed for coercion) rather than sf where workflows did not 
otherwise use sf. Very grateful for input here or 
https://github.com/r-spatial/evolution/issues.

Thank you for your replies. I think I am misunderstanding something. I have
read the shapefile using sf. I would like to combine polygons for Cyprus
and Northern Cyprus only within the world shapefile and keep all the other
polygons as they are.

world <- sf::st_read(dsn = "~/gadm36_levels_shp", layer = "gadm36_0")

Is something like the following correct? I was thinking of generating a
group variable which is unique to all the countries except Cyprus and
Northern Cyprus. I a probably making this too complicated.

world %>%
  group_by(group) %>%
  summarise(geometry = sf::st_union(geometry)) %>%
  ungroup()

Thank you again.

Briefly, is sf::aggregate() what you are looking for? Or terra::aggregate() if you read with terra::vect()?

Thank you! Yes, sp will by default switch to using sf in place of rgdal
for creating "CRS" objects, and under sp::spTransform in June, and all
three retiring packages rgdal, rgeos, and maptools will be gone by October
2023. An sp release will appear in May with a transition guide.

It seems that terra does not have an object corresponding to sp's "CRS" or
sf's "crs". As far as I can see, one needs to create an empty
SpatVector/SpatRaster object and assign a CRS, coerce to "Spatial", and
extract its slot. If this makes sense, sp could use terra (and
raster, needed for coercion) rather than sf where workflows did not
otherwise use sf. Very grateful for input here or
https://github.com/r-spatial/evolution/issues.

Hi Milu,

If you want to combine just a few of the thousands of features in
world then you will have to manage them individually.  Essentially
extract the subset to be combined, do the combination steps, and then
add them back to the world.  I am very not familiar with GADM and I
only have version 4.1, but all of the attributes appear to be
character type, which raises the question about what you want
aggregate() to do - it can't take the mean of a character attribute.
In the example below I show how you might take just the first value of
each attribute.  While this combining is possible, it doesn't mean
that you will have "correct" attributes with your new single feature.
I guess you'll have to figure out what you really want to do with
that.

### start here
library(sf)
library(dplyr)
# a function called by aggregate() for each attribute
first_item = function(x){
  x[[1]]
}
# read in the database downlaoded from https://gadm.org/data.html
world = read_sf("~/Downloads/gadm_410.gpkg")
# find the Cypriot features (we'll use this twice)
ix = grepl("Cyp", world$NAME_0, fixed = TRUE)
# pull them out of world
Cyp_features = dplyr::filter(world, ix)
# aggregate - which works for the geometry but is wrong in terms of
handling the attributes
Cyp_union = aggregate(Cyp_features,
                      sf::st_union(Cyp_features),
                      first_item)
# bind the world (less Cypriot features) with the combined Cypriot aggregation
new_world = dplyr::bind_rows(dplyr::filter(world, !ix), Cyp_union)
### end here


Does that help?

Ben

Dear Ben,

Thank you for your help. I will try this out. What I want to do is combine
the polygons of Cyprus and Northern Cyprus into one single polygon
eliminating the border. For the GADM, I am only interested in the
country-level shapefile. Thanks again!

Best regards,

Milu
