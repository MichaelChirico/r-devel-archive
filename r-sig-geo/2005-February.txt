Subject: [R-sig-Geo] A potential problem when using SparseM package and

Message-ID: <Pine.OSF.3.96.1050201115222.22616B-100000@alpha1.csd.uwm.edu>

Hi- 

I just found out that if you loaded the SparseM and spgwr packages at the
same time in R (2.0.1), spgwr won't work. The reason is that since the
function model.response() (which is intensively used in spgwr package) in
SparseM package requires different object class (an object of either
'matrix.csc.hb' or 'matrix.ssc.hb' class) than just a "data.frame".

Currently, the solution is to avoid loading the two packages together.
Hope this helps.

    Sincerely,
    Danlin Yu

Yes, this is correct. A longer-term fix will be to give spgwr a NAMESPACE, 
a medium-term to edit the source package to replace model.response() with 
model.extract(, "response") - with the appropriate model frame arguments 
in place, and the short-term as you suggest.

Subject: [R-sig-Geo] Conditional Simulation question
Message-ID: <4505b2b105020112115bc059a@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

My name is Matthew Sokol and I am writing this list serve to ask some
help. Currently I am a master's student at the University of Nevada
and have come across a problem using R that I can not solve.

Here is my problem:
I am using the R package geoR, specifically the function grf to simulate data.

Basically I have a data set that contains an Easting and Northing
coordinate system and a Z value. From this system I wish to perform
Ordinary Kriging. So I run the following command lines in R:
> dat<-read.table("examplepb.dat",header=TRUE)
> geodat<-as.geodata(dat)
> plot(geodat)
> vario<-variog(geodat)
> lines.variomodel(cov.model="gaussian",nugget=1800,cov.pars=c(1400,60),max.dist=150)

Now since I know the Nugget, Sill, and Range for the variogram model,
I wish to simulate more data that follows the same variogram model. So
I run the following command line:

> simdat<-grf(625,grid="reg",nugget=1800,cov.pars=c(1400,60))

Now, the problem with this command is that it produces data on grid
that is 1 x 1 (all the Northing and easting coordinates are now a
number 0-1). But my easting and northing coordinates have the
following properties:

Easting: Min 254.4	Max: 492
Northing: Min 118	Max 315

Which is not a 1 x 1 grid. 

I know my problem is in this statement: grid="reg"
I tried the following commands:
Loci<-expand.grid(seq(250,500,l=250),seq(115,320,l=205))
So now I run:
> simdat<-grf(625,grid=loci,nugget=1800,cov.pars=c(1400,60))

Which produces so much data that I can not R console will not display it.

So I run the following R commands:
geosim<-as.geodata(simdat)
> variosim<-variog(geosim)
variog: computing omnidirectional variogram
Error in vector("double", length) : cannot allocate vector of length 1444504375

So now I get an error. I think i may be producing to much data with my
simulation?

I am lost. I've looked through the manuals but have not found much on
conditional simulation. I was wondering if anyone knew of a problem
like this or where I can look to find more information.

I am sorry if the question is trivial as I have been reading the posts
on this list serve and everyone here has a command of the language far
surpass mine. Thank you for your time.

Matthew

1. the "grid" argument can also taka a matrix with coordinates values.
Terefore if you want N locations in coordinates which are not in the
1x1 square just generate a Nx2 matrix witht the coordinates and pass it to
"grid"

2. grf produces "uncoditional" simulations.
To obtain conditional simulations you will need to use either
krige.conv (for "tradidional" kriging algorithms)  or
krige.bayes(for "Bayesian" kriging.)

See for instance help(krige.conv)

hope this helps

P.J.

Please be more precise! Do you mean "from the ground up"? Or do you mean
that the help pages and examples in the alpha draft package on the
r-spatial sourceforge site are incomplete? In this case, please state
which version you are using.

Subject: [R-sig-Geo] Back-transformation of Beta in geoR
Message-ID: <AEF7C40954294D42990B3F90C6C73A450101649B@figmail.fig.fk>

Hi:

I am interested in back-transforming the mle of parameter Beta
and its variance when the Lambda parameter of the Box-Cox 
transformation has been estimated and its estimate is not 0 nor 
0.5.
Is this back-transformation equivalent to simply averaging over
a fine grid inside the polygon containing the predictions of, say
krige.conv (given that geoR back-transform when kriging=
predicting)?
For example
>alpha<-sum(krig.object$pred)/N
>salpha<-sum(sqrt(krig.object$krige.var))/N
where krig.object has been obtained by using a likfit
object as argument in krige.control, and N is the number of nodes 
in the grid (a big number).
The questions are, 
1) is alpha aproximately equal to the back-
transformation of the mle of Beta?
2) is salpha aproximately equal to the 'standard
error' of the back-transformation of the mle of Beta?

Ruben

Dear Ruben

You don't want to do kriging here.

I think the most simple solution is to this by simulation. Implicitly 
you are saying that beta is one-dimensional.
You will find the mean and variance of the beta parameter from the 
output from the likfit function.

mean(BCtransform(rnorm(2000, mean=outfromlikfit$beta, 
sd=sqrt(outfromlikfit$beta.var)),lambda = 0.72, inverse = TRUE))

gives what you want.

Dear Roger Bivand

Since I noticed a new version of maptools, I upgraded the maptools and then 
checked the changelog.

> maptools(changes=T)
maptools, version 0.4-11, 2005-01-17
[snip]
0.4-10 Function write.linelistShape() added to output a list of lines to a 
0.4-10 shapefile, as suggested by Patrick Giraudoux.

So, no changelog of version 0.4.11 was given.  It is nice if you show
us the change.

Thanks for keeping me alert! The entry is: "Adding checks for length()  
being zero", so no changes to functionality. The problem is that when
length(x) is 0, 1:0 produces indices for the loop for (i in 1:length(x)),
but should omit the loop if length(x) is 0. 0.4-12 will be coming soon,
and will have the required information in the changes file.

Can I ask whether I should continue to provide the current plot order 
heurisitic as an option - I am considering dropping the present scheme, 
which tries to guess the ring direction and plot order of polygons and 
sub-polygons form their inclusion inside each other. The reason for 
dropping it as default (for Map2poly(..., raw=FALSE)) is a user report of 
an otherwise valid shapefile generating a plot order which was corrupted 
(had one polygon of 1750 missing).

The new approach is to force all single polygons to be clockwise, and to 
plot them from largest to smallest. For multipolygons, the largest 
sub-polygon will be clockwise, and plotted first, and included 
sub-polygons will have their ring directions switched to anti-clockwise if 
included in another subpolygon of the multipolygon.

This scheme will also be used in the up-coming sp package, so please 
express your views now!

Best wishes,

Roger

O.K. Understood.

As for the new plotting approach, since my knowledge of data
structure in polygons and shapefile is too poor to understand it
(there are so many unclear points), I cannot help you.  Hope other
members in this list provide valuable suggestion.
