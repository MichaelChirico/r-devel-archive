Subject: [R-sig-Geo] optimal sampling
Message-ID: <42596600.2040503@poczta.fm>


Hi List,

I am looking for a package for R for optimal sampling. I want to design
sampling schema for field measurements of respiration. There are some
methods for optimal sampling design before variogram modeling, for
example: spatial simulated annealing (SSA), but i didn't find any
software implementation. Do you know any function or package, or any
software, code etc. for this?


best regards,
michal

maybe you can spin something out of the R SNA (social network analysis)

You can use the option 'is.cluster' to pass the name of the function
that will test if the current ball is a cluster or not. In fact, opgam
is nothing more than a general function which you can use to try
different scan functions (such as Kulldorff's statistic).

It seems a good idea, but you may have clusters at different levels that
may remain undetected. The key here is that, for a given radius, small
variations in the 'cluster' centre may produce different configurations
of areas. This means that, specially when  small areas are present, by
varying a few meters (i.e., 100 meters) the step of the grid many
different configurations of areas can be tested.

So, if you force the grid to have at least a 300-meter step and you work
at the postcode level, you may not be able to detect some clusters.

I think that if you have extra-variation in your data the observed
number of cases will be higher than expected by the Poisson model. That
might be a reason...

I wouldn't use the 'permutation' model unless I had very homogeneous
(i.e., same population) areas. In addition, the 'permutation' model is
better suited to check homogeneity of the data  than clustering.

Try to add 'model="negbin"' to 'calculate.mle'. As you have written it,
you are estimating the parameters for the Poisson model, not the
Negative Binomial. The number and names of the parameters differ between
these two models.

The error occurs in the iterative procedure to estimate the parameters
but I can't guess why. Could you run 'empbaysmooth(pcpoor$Observed,
pcpoor$Expected)' to see if it crashes?

'mle' has not been properly estimated. That's why you get an error.

Hum. It was originally in the package but I decided to remove it from
the package (and all the references to it in the documentation). If you
really want to use it I can send you what I have (I think I still have
it).

Well... :D I really like this question because I have been thinking
about that and I think the solution is parallel computing. :P

I am serious. Most of the computations in the scan methods can be done
in parallel if the total study region is split into smaller regions. The
only tricky thing is to be careful with the boundaries and consider all
the areas surrounding every smaller study area.

But if you want to check the limits of a desktop PC computing distances
once is a good idea. Compute it and save it into a file. I am sure
loading will take less time than recomputing it and you can select the
distances you need later.


> B) I wonder whether permutations always are superior to standard stats. 
> Distributions, and if not, then why not?

Permutations only make sense when you have very homogeneous areas. Note
that if you have non-homogeneous populations the areas can't be compared
directly and the permutation test is not useful (it will always give
significant results).

By using standard distributions, each area has a number of parameters
that describe how data behave in that particular area. Then, the
observed number of cases in each area is compared to the critical values
of that specific distribution.

When the distribution is 'complex' (for example, a negative binomial)
bootstrap gives you an approximation to the critical values.

Note that when you use a multinomial/Poisson model, areas can be
aggregated (i.e., you construct a new variable which is the sum of the
current variables) and the  observed number of cases in the new set of
areas still follow a multinomial/Poisson (with different parameters).

It is not the case when you use a N. Binomial distribution because the
sum of random variables following this distribution is not Neg.
Binomially distributed. Well, only if the prob. parameter is the same,
which is highly unlikely in an epidemiological problem.


I hope this solves all your doubts. I am afraid this is an e-mail
difficult to digest... but don't hesitate to write if you have further
questions.

Best regards,

Virgilio

Subject: [R-sig-Geo] sp: a package with classes and methods for spatial data
	in R
Message-ID: <425E9DCB.60803@geo.uu.nl>

Dear spatial R package maintainer and/or R-sig-geo subscriber,

we are happy to announce the beta (i.e. pre-CRAN) release of "sp",
a new R package which has new-style classes and methods for spatial data.

Spatial data types that sp implements are: points, grids, lines and
polygons (i.e., rings). Methods include

  + the usual print, summary, plot, [, [[, ...
  + coercion between types (e.g. points and grids, matrices, data.frames)
  + coordinates(x), which returns the spatial coordinates of x
  + bbox(x), returns the bounding box of x
  + overlay, to query the value of e.g. points in polygons or grid
    (essentially does a point-in-polygon or point-in-raster cell)
  + spsample, for random sampling methods over a spatial domain.

An additional package (spproj) provides coordinate reference system
transformation (projection or re-projection) using the PROJ.4 library
[2]. Others will provide interfaces to GRASS and gdal.

A good deal of work has also gone into providing plotting methods using
base, grid and lattice graphics, through the spplot function, a
front-end to lattice plots for spatial data (see gallery [1]).

The home page of these packages is found at
http://r-spatial.sourceforge.net/

The reason why we wrote this package is that we think R is an excellent
environment to deal with spatial data, but that it lacks a uniform way
to deal with spatial data. Compared to the handling of dates and times,
which can utilize base classes or those provided in the chron package,
spatial data handling is much more fragmented. As a consequence:

  - various packages make their own assumptions about how spatial data
    are organized
  - spatial data organized for a certain package cannot easily be used
    for another package
  - few (or no) packages address the full range of spatial data types
    (points, grids, lines, polygons)
  - generic spatial functionality (e.g. I/O to GIS, plotting, projection)
    is scattered and limited in functionality.

It also means that many different package authors have to use time writing
similar data handling code, rather than concentrating on analytical
functions. If the sp package achieves its goals, data I/O will become
many-to-one, and data access for analysis one-to-many, providing a shared
data object layer for which shared methods can be written.

Classes and methods for spatial data are only useful when the spatial
packages support them. Our team includes maintainers of a number
of spatial R packages, but we would value your support in making sp
a success.

First, we would like to ask you to review critically what we are proposing
in the package, and to give us the benefit of your experience in spatial
data handling. Are there classes of data that you feel we define wrongly
or inadequately? Are there clearly better ways of designing the classes
and methods we have tried so far? Are any of our classes unnecessary? We
realise that the documentation needs more work, first we would like to
get the code into better shape. So your comments will have most value
now; when on CRAN, users will count on the classes (i.e. the slots)
being fixed; at this stage we can still modify them.

Secondly, we would like to invite you to consider supporting the sp
classes directly in your packages. Two possible ways of supporting sp
classes are:

a. to write conversion routines to and from the classes in sp

b. extend your package with methods for your (main) package functions
    that accept and return the classes provided by sp, allowing the user
    to directly display the results, or use them in other packages.

If we can help in any way with this process, please let us know.

The development of this package is a joint effort of Virgilio Gomez-Rubio,
Barry Rowlinson, Roger Bivand and Edzer Pebesma, and followed from
discussions held at a pre-DSC2003 workshop [3], announcements on R-sig-geo
[4], and a meeting held last November in Lancaster [5].

With best regards,

Very cool. I'd been thinking of something similar, but not had the time
to act on it. Looks like we need to add OGR wrappers to rgdal so that
vector data can be read in.

A couple of immediate items I noticed:

1) "sp" is rather terse, no? I like more descriptive package names.

2) I think it is always a good idea to let typing describe internal
states (ie making objects stateless). It leads to much cleaner
interfaces and many fewer coding errors. If there are two different ways
to represent a grid, make two classes. If they are perfectly
substitutable (functions can take either), join them with a super-class.
If one is a perfect subset of the other, then make it the parent class
and the extension the child (inherits). See GDALDataset and
GDALReadOnlyDataset. GDALDataset is a perfect superset of
GDALReadOnlyDataset and so can be passed to any function needing the
interface of GDALReadOnlyDataset. This is formalized by having
GDALDataset inherit from GDALReadOnlyDataset. If you are writing
functions that check or update the internal states of your objects
(except ordinary insertion and deletion of contained items), then you
should think twice about the object hierarchy. This is why there are no
"is.writable" or "make.writable" functions in rgdal. That's all handled
by type declarations (meaning you can customize dispatch on types in
your methods ;-)

3) As long as we can override methods of the interface, all will be
well. We can substitute external data representations when we need to
scale to larger datasets. Try allocating a 50Kx50K matrix in R. There
will be times when we will want to have data be in a database or on disk
and still manipulate it with the "sp" interface. I don't see any
barriers to this at the moment. These external wrappers will want to
inherit from existing classes, so see point 2 above.

Love the image gallery! Nice work!

Indeed! Bravo. This is a big day for R users (at least it is for me). I
agree with Tim's comment wrt to having db functionality. I run out of RAM
way too fast as it is and will be tempted to do bigger things in R now that
this package exists.

Dear Roger Bivand and Edzer Pebesma,

It is happy to see improvement of the sp and related packages.  My
request for easy installation is to prepare your download site to
accept install.package() command inside R.

For example, we can install RGtk package with contriburl option.
> install.packages("RGtk", contriburl="http://www.omegahat.org/download/R/packages")

Another example,
> install.packages("pmg",contriburl="http://www.math.csi.cuny.edu/pmg")

My trial was
> install.packages("sp",contriburl="http://r-spatial.sourceforge.net")
trying URL `http://r-spatial.sourceforge.net/PACKAGES'
Error in download.file(url = paste(contriburl, "PACKAGES", sep = "/"),  : 
        cannot open URL `http://r-spatial.sourceforge.net/PACKAGES'
In addition: Warning message: 
cannot open: HTTP status was `404 Not Found' 

Concentration on improving R package is  a priority matter, but hope
to provide us a little more convenience.

I apologize if you already have such system on the site.

Thank you.

I think Barry has been there with Rmaps. It would
be nice to integrate this functionality into rgdal, because OGR
is part of rgdal, and the external-library dependence is still,
well, a bit clumsy for R under Windows.

Yes. Think of ts for time series. We thought of "spatial", but
that name has been taken long ago. sp is the first two letters
in spdep, splancs, spproj, ... Other suggestions, please?

I've been struggling with this for quite a while, and I do value
your suggestions. In an earlier attempt I tried two classes,
but I got strangled by the many setIs() and setAs() constructs
needed, which in addition didn't seem to do what I wanted.

Trouble is: right now SpatialGrid extends SpatialPoints: they're
points that happen to lie on a grid, so they carry grid topology
and an index to which grid cells the points belong. The full grid
representation in some sense is a special case of this, because
all points are there, in ordered form. In the data requirement
sense they're not: full grids don't need coordinates nor an index.
Data-wise, the extension is reversed: a full grid is the most
general case, the partial grid needs in addition an index (and,
-disputably-, coordinates). I'll think a bit longer about the
superclass idea, and struggle further with the setIs() stuff.

It's very convenient to have grids that behave like specially
ordered points.

I was playing with Europe on a kilometer grid, and wasn't

This sounds extremely valuable; could this be done by moving
parts from rgdal into sp, or do we need to copy? Again, full
integration is out of the question because of the Windows/
CRAN/external library issue.

Actually, I have liked the "conciseness" of 'sp'
(when I first heard about it from Roger quite a while ago):

It should become *the* basic spatial class infrastructure
package.  Hence it makes sense to emphasize its importance by
attributing a `top level' name.

I agree, the package is a great foundation for building a richer spatial
analysis framework. I'm nit-picking about the name. Not a real
complaint. Mostly I'm thinking right now about the class relationships.
We need to get that right. This is a very good start. I may suggest some
very minor tweaks. Overall, I like the layout.

Has anybody implemented the Granger causality test in R? The bivariate test
is just an F test for 0 values of lagged regressors and can be implemented
easily. A function that for multivariate Granger causes would require
fitting a vector autoregressive model and I'm hoping that somebody before me
has coded it!

Thanks in advance, Andy

In 2.1.0, doing RSiteSearch("Granger") gives some hits, but it looks as 
though this test is not available with this name - plenty of other things 
in tseries, urca, and fSeries though.

Message-ID: <AEF7C40954294D42990B3F90C6C73A45010164F5@figmail.fig.fk>

Hi:
Maybe i am slightly offtopic (again). I would
like to point to the mathematical reasoning leading to
the Whittle-Matern correlation function implemented
by default in geoR. My doubt is in the passage from eq.
(62) to eq. (63) in Whittle's 1954 Biometrika paper, on
stationary processes in the plane. It is rather easy to
see the equivalence of these two equations but i believe
the random term on the rhs has changed its moments,
though Whittle may have thought trivial to say so. Anyone
cares to look at this and tell me if i am correct?
Cheers
Ruben

Tripack also calculates the Delauney triangulation (tri.mesh) which is
the dual of the Voronoi tessellation.  I haven't looked at the data
structure, but the first order neighbors in the triangulation are also
the Voronoi neighbors I believe.

If you look at the code in tri2nb() in the spdep package, you may see an 
easy way to get what you need, even if the nb object is overkill. In fact, 
neighbours(tri.mesh(x, y)), using functions from tripack, should be 
enough, returning a list with the point numbers.

Yes, that has to be true by definition as the Varonoi arcs bisect the
Delauney arcs.

Assuming the same triangulation algorithm is used in tri.mesh as in
voronoi.mosaic (likely if in the same package, haven't looked at the
details).  But see
http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~lambert/java/3d/delaunay.html for
alternatives.

Subject: [R-sig-Geo] Voronoi polygons: New question: Spatial Registration
	of spatial data layers?

Thanks for everyone's advice and suggestions on this topic;
Looks like the cells() method of tripack provides me with 
the information I need to solve my problem. 

Now, if you don't mind, another question. Is it possible to
spatially register multiple data layers (in the classic GIS
fashion) so as to identify multiple attributes from all the 
layers for the same geographic coordinate? The 'point in 
polygon' problem, with multiple map layers. 

No doubt I could (and would) solve this using GRASS and the
R interface, but several ecologists here at the Center 
would like to have an 'R only' solution. 

Thanks for any information, links, .pdfs, etc..

Assuming the same triangulation algorithm is used in tri.mesh as in
voronoi.mosaic (likely if in the same package, haven't looked at the
details).  But see
http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~lambert/java/3d/delaunay.html for
alternatives.

Rick, you may want to have a closer look at the
sp package, which is on its way to CRAN (submitted last night).
I think it does what you want: attributes in data.frames,
each row related to topology (of point, grid cell, line,
or polygon type). You could see a column in the data.frame
part then as a GIS data layer.

An early announcement is found here:

https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-geo/2005-April/000378.html

and the home page and graph gallery is at
http://r-spatial.sourceforge.net/

Keep us posted on whether it fits your needs.

Bests,

Subject: [R-sig-Geo] geoR's Sigma-sq and Tau-sq
Message-ID: <AEF7C40954294D42990B3F90C6C73A4501016506@figmail.fig.fk>

Hi:
By using
>likfitobject$info.minimisation.function
after fitting data using likfit one can see
that the hessian has 2 dimensions less than the
number of parameters reported in 
>summary(likfitobject)
I already know that beta is computed from
the other parameters. The remaining 
'missing' dimension must be because
the optimization routine actually estimates
the ratio between sigma-sq and tau-sq rather
than each one separately. So how does geoR 
recover the values of sigma-sq and tau-sq reported 
in the summary? I have tried multiplying the estimated 
ratio and the total variance in the original data (transformed
with the mle of lambda) but that does not give
me the mles of sigma-sq and tau-sq reported in
summary.
Thanks for clarifications
Ruben
