Subject: [R-sig-Geo] plot_tiltedmaps isn't showing anything
Message-ID: <CAGg5H0Yu45h_sagNNG7BKngRp0=7qw8RborgdU0PRbaPn=QnmA@mail.gmail.com>

I am trying to plot 2 raster files but when I am using the *plot_tiltedmaps
*function the plot is empty. I am following the steps in the 2nd tutorial
<https://github.com/marcosci/layer>, called *More advanced example*. Any
ideas why is that?

Here is the code:

# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("marcosci/layer")

library(layer)
library(terra)

wd <- "path/"

pop = rast(paste0(wd, "pop.tif"))
agbh = rast(paste0(wd, "agbh.tif"))

pop <- tilt_map(pop, y_tilt = 3, x_shift = 25, y_shift = 50, parallel =
TRUE)
agbh <- tilt_map(agbh, y_tilt = 3, x_shift = 50, y_shift = 100, parallel =
TRUE)

map_list <- list(pop, agbh)

plot_tiltedmaps(map_list, palette = c("tofino", "rocket"), direction =
c(-1, 1))
You can download the data from here

 Calculating median age for a group of US census blocks?

Dr. Snow, thanks so much for your response to my question.

I think I'm going to stick with the lower- and upper-bounds method I
described, even though it gives a wider range for the median age than
other methods. I read the vignette for 'survival' as well at the
chapters on survival from MASS and another book I have, and couldn't
make heads or tails of it, much less how to apply it to this question.
In the unlikely event of someone asking me to explain or defend my
conclusions on median age for my neighborhood population, I would be
lost about survival statistics, but could manage, with numerous hand-
waves, to explain my method. I'm an old, retired guy who thinks
statistics are fun, not someone with any kind of professional training
or credentials.

Thank you, again, for your thoughtful and thorough response. I
appreciate your help.

-Kevin

Subject: [R-sig-Geo] NASA's Black Marble monthly data: Reprojection isn't
 accurate
Message-ID: <CAGg5H0a79NK8JSbEXEshugAuse=6VF-8e4j5gcfFFgrCEBQEgQ@mail.gmail.com>

I downloaded NASA's Black Marble monthly nighttime light NTL data, VNP46A3
<https://ladsweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/missions-and-measurements/products/VNP46A3/>.
In a previous question
<https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/466571/extent-not-found-on-nasas-black-marble-monthly-images-how-to-set-it/466574?noredirect=1#comment761916_466574>
of mine the reprojection worked perfectly but now it seems that it doesn't.
For example, I wanted to download NTL data for the city of Mumbai, India.
After reprojecting the NTL (product 5 (All_Angles_Snow_Free) from the .h5)
the result is attached here
<https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1V115zpdU2-5fXssI6iWv_F6aNu4E5qA7>.

At the bottom if the image is a shp of Mumbai (downloaded from GADM) and
the red circle in the top indicates where Mumbai is in the NTL image.
Clearly something's not right.

I downloaded the image from here
<https://ladsweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/missions-and-measurements/products/VNP46A3/>
(LAADS-DAAC, Level-1 and Atmosphere Archive & Distribution System
Distributed Active Archive Center). The code I used to extract the NTL
radiance image is:

library(terra)

wd <- "path/"

r <- rast(paste0(wd, "VNP46A3.A2018091.h25v07.001.2021125122857.h5"))
crs(r) <- "epsg:4326"

2400*(15/(60*60))

h = 25
v = 7

ext(r) = c(-180+h*10,-180+(h+1)*10, (v-2)*10,(v-1)*10)

ntl <- r[[5]]

writeRaster(ntl, paste0(wd, "ntl.tif"), overwrite = TRUE)

Why the code worked perfectly in the previous question and now it doesn't?
>From here
<https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1V115zpdU2-5fXssI6iWv_F6aNu4E5qA7>
you can download the .h5 image if you don't want to use NASA's website. I
am using R 4.3.1 and RStudio 2023.06.2+561.

Be very careful with canned steps to "fix" georeferencing, make sure it
needs fixing and check that it's right. Ultimately the best way to "fix" it
is to go to the source of the code that interfaces the data, which here is
GDAL and report there - but clearly that's been updated from whatever
version was in use on stackoverflow.

Cheers, Mike

 NASA's Black Marble monthly data: Reprojection isn't accurate

My gdal 3.4.1 doesn't get the extent.

I answered this (badly) on gis.stackexchange - its a 10degree tile where
the origin is related to the h and v elements of the path (and also stored
as attributes in the netcdf structure).

I think I messed up the vertical offset, which was because I only bothered
making it work on one tile. The tile position is going to be A+Bh, C+Dv
where A,B,C,D are constants, and B and D are either plus or minus 10
depending on if the origin is top or bottom or left or right, and A and C
are the origins of the 0-th tiles. Once you have the origin, add 10 to get
the extent. This gives the correct resolution (15 minutes of arc).

Maybe tomorrow I'll get a few more tiles and write up my answer in an edit
on stackex, and check all the extents etc are correct, and put my code in a
function. I didn't have time to do all that previously but hoped there was
enough there for understanding of the problem and anyone with a bit of
maths could fix it up.
