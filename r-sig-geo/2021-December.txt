Subject: [R-sig-Geo] create projection for a .asc file in Rstudio
Message-ID: <e81XFT4lAFRg9r2F_sKaIrLmaSfBxGDy2a2s5Gq2LjuMVlVKW6tIvGgYgPx5O12jZVqqQUWRtlUaD5skz5vaEVKp_Ynds_K8nxb93zSf1YI=@protonmail.com>

Good evening every ones.

I am trying to set a projection system for an ascii file in Rstudio.

I reached to import the .asc on R and to plot it. Now I need to set a projection.

In my matrix I have CRS : NA

I tried two ways :

First way:

crs(rasterClimat, asText=F)
crs(rasterClimat)<- "+proj=lcc +lat_1=48 +lat_2=33 +lon_0=-100 +datum=WSG84"

crs(rasterClimat)

w<- wkt(rasterClimat)

w

cat(w, "\n")

(taken from here :https://rdrr.io/cran/raster/man/projection.html)

Second way:

crs(rasterClimat)<-"proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs +ellps=WGS84+towgs84= 0,0,0"

(taken from here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqbVyt8mjIk, tutorial that I followed)

For the two methods, the error message is the same :

Error in sp::CRS(SRS_string = x) : NA

I followed the youtube tutorial, our two cases seem similar but she reached to project her map.

May someone gives me some clues about what I do not understand in this process and where I have to look for and/or what can I do to fix it?
I want to do it on R, I do not want to use a GISsoftware to set the coordinate system then import the file into R.

I put in attachment the code I used if you want to have a close look, and the .asc files.

Thank you very much for your time,
best regards,

Basile.

Dear Basile,
the PROJ4 string has a really strict specification. You cannot use
crs(rasterClimat)<-"proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs 
+ellps=WGS84+towgs84= 0,0,0"
but can use
crs(rasterClimat)<-"+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs +ellps=WGS84 
+towgs84=0,0,0"
(see the differences in the plus sign and the spaces)

Dear List and Andrey and Paulo

You might like to look at the Fuzme package at this link 
http://smartdigiag.com/software/#s-4.

The notes on it say:
/Fuzme is an R package for calculation of Fuzzy k-means with/without 
extragrades. I wanted to integrate fuzzy-k means into my R workflow so i 
translated some of Budiman Minansy?s matlab code into R. The R version 
of Fuzzy k-means with extragrades is a little buggy. The FuzME 
<http://sydney.edu.au/agriculture/pal/software/fuzme.shtml> software is 
more stable and efficient. I would recommend using that for most things. 
If you are trying to embed the classification into your R workflow 
though, the R packages is OK, but not as computationally efficient. I am 
working on it when i can./

regards

David

Dear David,

Sorry for the late answer. Thanks for your help and suggestions. In the 
meantime, I found this work http://mck.riks.nl/ which I thought would 
answer my questions. I have already tried the "Map Comparison Kit 3" 
software and it seems to provide exactly what I was looking for. Still, 
it surprises me that something like this doesn't seem to exist in R.

Cheers,

PauloFR

Hello every one!

I am trying to compute the area of buildings inside neighbourhoods. I have a shapefile with the buildings and one with the neighbourhoods. I want to know the built-up area per neighbourhood but I do not understand how to procede.
I already compute the areas of each neighbourhood and I reach to attribute at each neighbourhood the buildings which are within. I created a field "batcount" in the neighbourhoods shapefile.
However I do not have the geometries of the buildings in this shapefile and I do not know how to procede in order to find the area of the buildings in each neighbourhood.

Here is the code I used to join the two shapefiles in order to count the number of buildings in each neighbourhood.

bat_count_iris <- st_join(bat, neighbourhoods) %>%
st_set_geometry(NULL) %>%
group_by(CODE_NEIGHBOURHOOD) %>%
tally() %>%
select(CODE_NEIGHBOURHOOD, batcount = n)
bat_in_iris <- left_join(CODE_NEIGHBOURHOOD, bat_count_iris, by = 'CODE_NEIGHBOURHOOD') %>%
mutate(batcount = ifelse(is.na(batcount), 0, batcount))

Do you have any clue of how I can compute the areas of the buildings in each neighbourhood?

Have a great day,
Basile.

Hi Basile,

I'm not sure I fully understand the question. How does a shapefile of the
buildings not have geometry?

Do you want the area of building per neighborhood, their counts, or both?

bat_neigh_int <- bat %>%
  mutate(bat_area = st_area(.)) %>% # adds area to input file, may want to
change units.
  st_join(.                         # add neighborhood identifier
"CODE_NEIGHBOURHOOD" via spatial join
          , neighborhoods
          , join = st_intersects # check the help, you may want st_within
or to try both ways
          , left = TRUE)

buil_area_per_neigh <- bat_neigh_int %>%
  st_drop_geometry() %>%
  group_by(CODE_NEIGHBOURHOOD) %>%
  summarise(neigh_build_area = sum(bat_area) # gets the area of buildings
in each neighborhood
            , build_count = sum(n()))                          # counts the
buildings in each neighborhood

Then join buil_area_per_neigh back to neighborhoods with left_join

Does this help? Again I am a little confused about the intended outcome.

Best, Dexter
