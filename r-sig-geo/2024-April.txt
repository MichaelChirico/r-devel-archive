Hi,

That's a huge topic! You might start by going to rseek.org and
searching for multivariate spatial models. There are many packages
that perform that kind of analysis.

Browsing the Spatial task view at
https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/ and maybe also the Multivariate
task view might give you a broader view of the multivariate and
spatial capabilities of R packages.

If you can't find what you are looking for, a more specific question
might get you more specific answers. :)

Sarah

Hi Manuel,

If your models are for predictive purpose, `spm` and `spm2` are perhaps the
right packages for you. Some methods for spatial predictive modelling are
introduced in the `spm` and `spm2` packages, including such as modern
statistical methods (i.e., generalised linear models, glmnet, generalised
least squares), random forest, gbm, svm, kriging methods, and a number of
hybrid methods. For more information, please see "Spatial Predictive
Modeling with R" that provides many reproducible examples of these methods.

Hope this helps,

Message-ID: <1712555632.268211515@webmail.jimdo.com>


Dear all,
There are a few seats left for our upcoming online course, "Multivariate Data Analysis with R and vegan" scheduled for 27-31 May.
Course Overview: In this course, participants will delve into the powerful capabilities of R, specifically focusing on the vegan package. From ordination methods to restricted permutations, you'll gain hands-on experience and practical insights into analyzing diverse datasets.
Target Audience and Assumed Background: Ideal for PhD students and researchers in biology and ecology-related fields, this course assumes a basic familiarity with RStudio and programming R code. We welcome individuals with limited statistical knowledge but a strong desire to learn.
Learning Outcomes: By the end of the course, you will:
- Gain a foundational understanding of multivariate data analysis approaches.
- Learn to select the most suitable method for your dataset.
- Master the use of restricted permutation tests with constrained ordination methods.
- Develop proficiency in utilizing R for multivariate data analysis.
Program Highlights: Sessions will run from 14:00 to 20:00 (Monday to Thursday) and 14:00 to 19:00 on Friday (Berlin time). The course structure includes lectures, practical exercises, and Q&A sessions to ensure an interactive and engaging learning experience.

Yes, this is the kind of multivariate spatial model I am looking for.
Particularly for areal or lattice data.

Dear all,
Ready to level up your statistical modeling skills? This 5-day course offers a hands-on introduction to generalized linear models (GLMs) using R.
Dates: 6-10 May (online)
This course is aimed at anyone who is interested in advanced statistical modelling as it is practiced widely throughout academic scientific research, as well as widely throughout the public and private sectors.

Message-ID: <CAL3ufUJyvNAFbM1+11LgTp_sv-Lw6PLZHfNGhSuwu7=ihSRLFw@mail.gmail.com>

Hey folks,

I'm hoping to build up my knowledge around spatial regression techniques
from the ground up?e.g. I'm not interested in R-INLA or other exceptionally
complex techniques.

I'm hoping this listserv has some recommendations for what readings /
models I should prioritize learning about in, possibly, an opinionated
order.

At the moment I've purchased "Modern Spatial Econometrics in Practice" by
Luc Anselin and Sergio Rey and will try to work through that. But if there
are additional resources that folks recommend that are friendly for the
not-so-math-inclined, I'd love to have a look at them!

The Spatial Regression section of the R-spatial book (
https://r-spatial.org/book/16-SpatialRegression.html) is good but with less
handholding than I might need.

Josiah--

I've found the following very helpful over the years:

Geographic Information Analysis, by David O'Sullivan and David Unwin

Spatial Point Patterns, by Adrian Baddeley, Ege Rubak, and Rolf Turner

Applied Spatial Data Analysis with R, by Roger Bivand, Edzer Pebesma,
and Virgilio Gomez-Rubio

Statistical Analysis of Spatial and Spatio-Temporal Point Patterns

The last 3 are, as the titles imply, focused specifically on spatial
point patterns. The first is a bit more general, including methods for
areal data.

I listed them in increasing order (in my opinion) of mathemtical complexity.

Please also consider:

@book{lesage+pace:09,
   author={James P. {LeSage} and R. Kelley Pace},
   title={Introduction to Spatial Econometrics},
   year={2009},
   publisher={Chapman and Hall/CRC},
   address={Boca Raton FL}
}

which provides the underpinnings to Golgher & Voss just suggested by Dexter. A good deal has been going on recently, both about spillovers, and very recent work by Bera & Koley on Rao score tests (aka Lagrange multiplier tests). I have some notes but no recording from recent lectures, so the notes are skeletal at best: https://rsbivand.github.io/PG_AGII_2sem/. In SDSr, my focus was on pointing up the topics areas where spatial econometrics could very well benefit from the much larger community in disease mapping and in ecology. In both of these broad communities, the dependent variable is often discrete, and both of these draw lots of maps. I haven't yet got Modelling Spatial and Spatial-Temporal Data: A Bayesian Approach by Haining & Li, and expect it to be useful.

Hope this helps,

Roger

which provides the underpinnings to Golgher & Voss just suggested by Dexter. A good deal has been going on recently, both about spillovers, and very recent work by Bera & Koley on Rao score tests (aka Lagrange multiplier tests).

In SDSr, my focus was on pointing up the topics areas where spatial econometrics could very well benefit from the much larger community in disease mapping and in ecology. In both of these broad communities, the dependent variable is often discrete, and both of these draw lots of maps. I haven't yet got Modelling Spatial and Spatial-Temporal Data: A Bayesian Approach by Haining & Li, and expect it to be useful.

Hope this helps,

Thank you, Chris! I can take a look at the first resource. At the moment my
interest is specifically in spatial econometric models and less so about
point patterns (for the time being).

Renato, friends,

This repo: https://github.com/rsbivand/kk_spatial_book has updated code for Katarzyna Kopczwska's book to work after rgdal etc. were retired. I used it in a talk last November which explains what is going on - please contact me if you'd like a copy of the slides.

https://a.co/d/1gF4NTE Bayesian Analysis for the Social Sciences by Simon Jackman m. He deep dives into the philosophy behind both probability axioms of finite (Kolgomorov) and countable (de Finetti) perspectives. His take on Bayes vs frequentist is a gem! He also clarifies the most severe shortcoming on the frequentist approach: that mixed modal priors cannot produce mixed modal posteriors ? Regards, Rudy Banerjee

I've found the following very helpful over the years:

Geographic Information Analysis, by David O'Sullivan and David Unwin

Spatial Point Patterns, by Adrian Baddeley, Ege Rubak, and Rolf Turner

Applied Spatial Data Analysis with R, by Roger Bivand, Edzer Pebesma,
and Virgilio Gomez-Rubio

Statistical Analysis of Spatial and Spatio-Temporal Point Patterns

The last 3 are, as the titles imply, focused specifically on spatial
point patterns. The first is a bit more general, including methods for
areal data.

I listed them in increasing order (in my opinion) of mathemtical complexity.

Hey folks,

I'm hoping to build up my knowledge around spatial regression techniques
from the ground up?e.g. I'm not interested in R-INLA or other exceptionally
complex techniques.

I'm hoping this listserv has some recommendations for what readings /
models I should prioritize learning about in, possibly, an opinionated
order.

At the moment I've purchased "Modern Spatial Econometrics in Practice" by
Luc Anselin and Sergio Rey and will try to work through that. But if there
are additional resources that folks recommend that are friendly for the
not-so-math-inclined, I'd love to have a look at them!

The Spatial Regression section of the R-spatial book (
https://r-spatial.org/book/16-SpatialRegression.html) is good but with less
handholding than I might need.
