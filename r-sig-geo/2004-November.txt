Dear Ono-san and Professor Bivand,

In my environment, Japanese characters in your example works fine with
read.dbf() in maptools ver. 0.4-8.

My environment: VineLinux3.0, R-2.0.0_ja-1vl1, maptools ver. 0.4-8

I am afraid that it is due to EUC-JP encoded DBF file and R localized
into Japanese, though. 

Availing myself of this question, let me ask a way to confirm if
read.dbf() has been surely replaced by maptools.  I have just done
"update.packages()" for obtaining the latest foreign and maptools.

Thank you for this contribution - it is not easy to debug
platform-dependent issues like this. I think having a corpus of files
would also help - as you mention below, the coding standard may differ as
does the platform. Having a small collection of DBF files known not to
behave the same across platforms should help, I hope - I can host them, or
maybe one of those of you close to the 2-byte character problem could host
them?

which also means foreign_0.8-0, because maptools_0.4-8 depends on it. Note 
that the problem was on Windows XP, I think with the standard binary R 
from CRAN.

This is possible, but all input is helpful here, also because R will 
migrate towards multi-character support at some stage.

The internal function dbf.read(), accessed as maptools:::dbf.read() in 
maptools up to 0.4-6, and as dbf.read() in maptools 0.4-7 is not present 
at all in maptools 0.4-8. If you just type the names of the functions at 
the prompt, the final line shows which namespace they live in:

> library(maptools)
Loading required package: foreign 
> read.dbf
function (file, as.is = FALSE) 
{
....
    df
}
<environment: namespace:foreign>

shows that read.dbf() from foreign is being used.

My name is Jakob Petersen. I am about to prepare a thesis in GISc at Birkbeck,
University of London, and would like to get started with R. I will be working
with the index of multiple deprivation in the UK and some economic indicators
from various sources.
I would be grateful for any references to R litterature and webs. Thank you.

Yes, the problem was on WinXP but I wanted to suggest not all platform
had the problem.  And I knew Ono-san use Japanized one, too, it may
not be always though.

All right.  I realized my misunderstanding. The old functions such as
dbf.read() and dbf.write() have gone to the foreign 0.8-0 packages
with changing the name as read.dbf() and write.dbf(), haven't they?

Thanks.

Hi there,

Examination of the problem with both Shift-JIS encoded and EUC-JP
encoded DBF in R-2.0 on win98 reminded me that no Japanese characters
can display in the original R for windows from CRAN. 

On R localized to Japanese, downloadable from
http://r.nakama.ne.jp/R-2.0.0/binary/win32/, I succeeded to display
Japanese characters with read.dbf() from foreign 0.8-0 on R-2.0, win98
when Shift-JIS encoded DBF is tested.  Since we cannot basically deal with EUC-JP
in windows system, trial with EUC-JP encoded DBF failed.

Because I do not have WinXP, I could not examine on WinXP.  If WinXP works
only with unicode and dose not work with Shit-JIS, conventional
encoding for windows, this could be essential issue.

I hope this helpful.

Sam:

    The best way of starting to code in R is to read the actual R
functions. In the case of SPDEP, you can simply type the name of a
function (for instance, errorsarlm, moran, etc.) in the R interface. The
code will show, you can either read them on the screen or print them out
for your convenience - at least, that's how I started to code in R. Wish
this helps.

Well, at the moment I run the CVS archive for spdep locally, but at the 
workshop at Lancaster last week, we talked through putting the CVS archive 
on sourceforge, so that development could be opened up a bit more than it 
is now - now contributors email me suggestions, and I commit after 
reviewing. 

The source code is available from CRAN too, so this has worked quite well. 
There are two areas which need advancing now, and help will be useful in 
either: adapting spdep to use the new S4 classes provided in the 
forthcoming sp package, including adapting the neighbour and weights 
classes from S3 to S4 and adding rectangular weights (the weights 
relations between in-set and out-of-set regions when subsetting), and the 
incorporation of CAR models.

With regard to VB, the ArcGIS link to R is illustrated at:

http://perso.univ-lr.fr/csaintje/Recherche/RArcgis/index.html

hosted by Christophe Saint-Jean; and an interesting example:

http://www.gisvet.org/Documents/GisVet04/RegularPapers/Tait.pdf

Of course there are other Windows VB clients that can run R as a server, 
like Excel, but I'm not aware of examples doing spatial work.

I hope these will give you some ideas,

Roger Bivand
