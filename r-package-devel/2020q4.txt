Subject: [R-pkg-devel] CRAN badges in README
Message-ID: <4de8b5bd-7ae3-4339-2369-a88f86a49750@bebac.at>

Dear all,

we are using badges in README files of our packages on GitHub and CRAN. 
Recently wrong results are reported:

https://github.com/Helmut01/replicateBE#readme shows CRAN Error
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/replicateBE/readme/README.html 
shows CRAN Not OK
though OK at 
https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_replicateBE.html

https://github.com/Detlew/Power2Stage#readme shows CRAN Not OK
though OK at 
https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_Power2Stage.html

https://github.com/Detlew/PowerTOST#readme shows CRAN Error
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/PowerTOST/readme/README.html 
shows CRAN Not OK
though one NOTE at 
https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_PowerTOST.html

All badges are linked with https://cranchecks.info/badges/worst/{package 
name}
I checked about 1 month ago and the first 2 showed CRAN OK and the last 
CRAN Note ? which was correct.

Any ideas?

Helmut

Hi,

A package submitted on CRAN shows problems only on ASAN/UBSAN.
I  used 'r-hub' (rhub::check()) to check if my update has fixed that on that platform but
This is unsuccessful since a dependency fails to install.

The dependency in question is 'xml2'  so it surely can be installed one way or another but do I need to give additional parameters? The report from r-hub is at

I never heard back from CRAN, neither via a direct message, nor here.

It seems that Debian testing has a new version of libxml2, or maybe
the ICU is newer, and the xml package does not compile with this.

I am afraid that xml2 needs some fixes to solve this. It might be
enough to require C++11 support. If you don't want to wait for the
xml2 maintainer, then you can fork the repo, add C++11 support to your
fork, and then (temporarily) add a `Remotes` field to `DESCRIPTION`
that points to your fork.

You might be having browser cache issues because I just looked and 
things are fine on this end. You can double check in another browser or 
clear the cache (usually via Preferences > Settings > Security).

FWIW, cran checks is an rhub/rOpenSci project: 
https://blog.r-hub.io/2019/06/10/cran-checks-api/, and not controlled by 
the CRAN team.

Sorry, seems that rhub suffered from hiccups. All fine now without 
clearing the cache. Case closed.

All the best,

 vignette building
Message-ID: <8E035DA3-66E3-4F03-B584-DAB0255F9BFD@stat.math.ethz.ch>

Dear list

I?m in the process of submitting a package to CRAN that uses a non-mainstream repository for several data packages that are too large for CRAN (~50 MB in total) and therefore live in a drat repository hosted by gh. Data from these packages is used during vignette building and unsurprisingly, CRAN checks throw a ?re-building of vignette? warning.

1. Is such a warning acceptable or is vignette re-build required to run through?
2. Is it allowed to create a set-up that essentially runs `install.packages()` during CRAN checks to make the non-mainstream repo packages available?
3. Are there any go-to solutions for such a scenario? I tried knitr caching, but was unsuccessful, to get that to work. What I?m currently doing is masking the package function that loads data and supplying the required data with the package. But this unnecessarily inflates package size (and adds complexity), as the data is already conveniently and separately available as an R package.

Best,
Nicolas

Hi Nicholas,

I see two potential solutions, maybe other people will suggest different ones:

  1. You can make the evaluation of the whole vignette dependent on the data packages being available. Here's an example from one of my packages: https://github.com/sahirbhatnagar/casebase/blob/3403e0451ba5f0bf122924729ba85a904cf16082/vignettes/smoothHazard.Rmd#L22-L27

  2. You create the vignette on your machine and add it to the package as a "static vignette". Here's a blog post on how to do it (it's also been discussed on this list before, have a look at the archive): http://www.markvanderloo.eu/yaRb/2019/01/11/add-a-static-pdf-vignette-to-an-r-package/

Each approach has its pros and cons. In the first solution, a potential issue is that the complete vignettes may rarely be available on a user's machine, unless they install the data package first and build from source. In the second solution, there's more maintenance for you.

   A collaborator is arguing that it's a good idea to license one small 
component of a package under the MIT license, while the rest of it 
remains GPL >=2.

   Suppose this is feasible.  How do I specify the license?  As far as I 
can tell from 
https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#Licensing 
the DESCRIPTION file should have

License: file LICENSE
License_is_FOSS: yes
License_restricts_use: no

   But I can't figure out what should go in the LICENSE file. The one 
file that contains the MIT-licensed components contains the relevant 
license text in its body.

License: GPL (>=2) | MIT + file LICENSE

doesn't seem right, because these are not *alternative* licenses.  Would 
"GPL (>=2) + file LICENSE" be OK? We could explain the situation in 
LICENSE.note (WRE says "To include comments about the licensing rather 
than the body of a license, use a file named something like 
LICENSE.note. ")

   Could file LICENSE contain

The code in this package is licensed under GPL >=2 (see 
https://www.r-project.org/Licenses/GPL-2, 
https://www.r-project.org/Licenses/GPL-3, except for <FILE xxx>, which 
is under the MIT license (see <FILE xxx for details>).

?

  Happy for advice or pointers to other packages that have successfully 
done something similar.

Looks like igraphdata may have heterogeneous licensing?

I have some recommendations at
https://r-pkgs.org/license.html#code-you-bundle, but in brief use License:
GPL (>= 2) and then explain in LICENSE.note which components have more
liberal licenses.

Hadley offers what you _can_ do, but if you want clarity in the minds of _users_ I would beg you to split the code into two packages. People will likely either be afraid of the GPL bogey man and refrain from utilizing your MIT code as permitted or fail to honor the GPL terms correctly if both are in the same package.

Have you read R's own doc/COPYRIGHTS ?

   https://github.com/wch/r-source/blob/trunk/doc/COPYRIGHTS

In short the opposite of what you just suggest. 

Also, labels such as "more liberal" or "permissive" or "bogey man" are not
exactly unambiguous.  Different people can and do have different views here.
I would suggest using simpler terms such as "different". What matters is that
the licenses permit open source use while ensuring they are compatible which
is generally the case these days.

I think this is a bit of an oversimplification, especially given that
"compatibility" is not symmetric. For example, you can include MIT license
code in a GPL licensed package; you can not include GPL licensed code
inside an MIT licensed package. There are some rough guidelines at
https://r-pkgs.org/license.html#license-compatibility.

One approach for issues such as legal matters is to consult subject-matter
experts which is why I pointed (in a prior private message spawned by this

You are addressing interpretation of "a license", while my concern is not with the licenses themselves but with the identification of which code goes with which license. Assuming that you will need to retain lawyers to decide how to handle a license in a particular use case may be reasonable, but assuming you will also use them to parse the files in the package  seems rather less reasonable IMO when you have such a clear alternative (packaging).

This is why I recommend that if you copy an entire directory of code you
include the LICENSE file for that directory; if you copy a single file,
make the license clear at the comment in a top of the file. This is
standard practice in most open source communities.

If you?re writing open source code, I don?t think it?s necessary to retain
a lawyer in order to handle these commonplace issues. (OTOH if you?re
building a business on top of open source code, hiring a lawyer is
absolutely essential).

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Windows builds not using latest BiocStyle version
Message-ID: <DB7PR06MB5881A0200AE218D2019D5A65CC0F0@DB7PR06MB5881.eurprd06.prod.outlook.com>

Dear all,

I am writing because I recently found that my NutrienTrackeR package was having build errors, failing at building the vignette.

I could trace the error to a bug in BiocStyle caused by a recent change in knitr, which was also causing a large number of Bioconductor packages to fail building.

The Bioconductor team pushed a new version of BiocStyle which fixed the error in all platforms for all packages that used BiocStyle for vignette output.

The change has been reflected on the build report of NutrienTrackeR (https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_NutrienTrackeR.html) for Linux and MacOS platforms, but not for any of the Windows builds. Having a look at the build report for R-devel in Windows, it seems the latest build was done with R Under development (2020-09-28 r79268).

I am wondering if it is possible the Windows builds for NutrienTrackeR are failing because they are not using still the most recent version of BiocStyle, or if on the contrary I should rather just remove BiocStyle output to fix the error?

Thanks a lot in advance!

Best wishes,

Rafa

Message-ID: <1a4301d69b36$973c0280$c5b40780$@ibime.upv.es>

Hi,

 

Some weeks ago we received the CRAN notification to update our
EHRtemporalVariability package in light of some Warnings found on the
vignette compilation.

 

We managed to solve most by including the ?webshot? package in the Suggests
list in DESCRIPTION, since the Vignette is rendered in .html including
dynamic Plotly plots.

 

However, we cannot manage to solve the last one, and thus we cannot update
the package in CRAN. Local checks show no Warnings (only a Note due to
having 5.1MB file). Even updated R to the latest ver 4.0.2 and R tools to
the latest 4, and all checks ok. But submitting on winbuilder the Warning is
still there.

 

The logs are here:

 <https://win-builder.r-project.org/9IvFwBBcgDlI>
https://win-builder.r-project.org/9IvFwBBcgDlI

 

This is the error:

 

        Error(s) in re-building vignettes:

--- re-building 'EHRtemporalVariability.Rmd' using rmarkdown

Quitting from lines 35-36 (EHRtemporalVariability.Rmd) 

Error: processing vignette 'EHRtemporalVariability.Rmd' failed with
diagnostics:

--- failed re-building 'EHRtemporalVariability.Rmd'

 

The package is exactly that found in
https://github.com/hms-dbmi/EHRtemporalVariability

 

Those lines 35-36 are the first chunk in the .Rmd vignette file:

```{r setup, include=FALSE}

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning=FALSE)

```

Surprisingly, if removing this chunk and resubmitting, the same ?argument is
of length zero? error is present but in the following (now first) chunk of
code.

 

Any help would be really appreciated. We would kindly provide any additional
info that could help.

Best regards!

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] is R CMD build --compact-vignettes working as
 expected?
Message-ID: <e34db7d9-28f0-36f3-0c8e-61e9586630d3@gmail.com>

   Am I confused, or doing something wrong, or ... ?

   I have qpdf installed, and am running R CMD build with 
--compact-vignettes, but the PDF in the tarball doesn't seem to be 
compressed despite the fact that the output messages say "compacting 
vignettes ..."


   $ R CMD build --compact-vignettes lme4
* checking for file ?lme4/DESCRIPTION? ... OK
* preparing ?lme4?:
* checking DESCRIPTION meta-information ... OK
* cleaning src
* installing the package to process help pages
* saving partial Rd database
* creating vignettes ... OK
Warning: ?inst/doc? files
     ?lmerperf.html?, ?lmer.pdf?, ?PLSvGLS.pdf?, ?Theory.pdf?
   ignored as vignettes have been rebuilt.
   Run R CMD build with --no-build-vignettes to prevent rebuilding.
* compacting vignettes and other PDF files
* cleaning src
* checking for LF line-endings in source and make files and shell scripts
* checking for empty or unneeded directories
* building ?lme4_1.1-24.tar.gz?

   The copy of lmer.pdf in the resulting tarball is 900K or so:

$ tar ztvf lme4_1.1-24.tar.gz lme4/inst/doc/lmer.pdf
-rw-r--r-- bolker/bolker 907022 2020-10-05 12:59 lme4/inst/doc/lmer.pdf

   The previously built (and manually compacted) version of lmer.pdf in 
the tarball is 500K:

$ ls -l lme4/inst/doc/lmer.pdf
-rw-r--r-- 1 bolker bolker 495199 Oct  3 22:15 lme4/inst/doc/lmer.pdf

    Is 'R CMD build' confused by the presence of a pre-built PDF in the 
inst/doc directory? Or am I somehow mistaken about how this is supposed 
to work?

    I would just use --no-build-vignettes and submit the tarball with 
the previously built/compressed PDF, but I'm trying to avoid a
"Package has a VignetteBuilder field but no prebuilt vignette index" 
NOTE, which I assume is missing because I built without building 
vignettes ... ?

   As always, enlightenment is welcome.

   cheers

Hi Carlos,

Your package seems to use BiocStyle to output the vignette. I have encountered a similar error with my NutrienTrackeR package. The issue was triggered by the latest update to the knitr package, which caused knitting of vignettes in BiocStyle output to fail.

The issue was resolved by the Bioconductor team by pushing a new version of BiocStyle. This fixed all packages dependent on BiocStyle on Bioconductor, and seems to also have fixed the build reports for NutrienTrackeR for all linux and MacOS builds.

However, it has not fixed the error for the windows builds (https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_NutrienTrackeR.html) . The error seems very similar to what you are getting, also being triggered by the first line of code in the vignette. If the issue is the same as what I was having, it will be triggered no matter how many chunks you remove, since it is the underlying combination of updated knitr and possibly not latest BiocStyle which triggers it.

Perhaps winbuilder and the machine building CRAN packages under windows are still not using the latest BiocStyle version for some reason?

Best wishes,

Rafa

Dear Ben,

I was hoping that someone would pick up on this problem, because I've 
experienced the same issue of --compact-vignettes apparently ignored, 
e.g., with the Rcmdr package under R 4.0.2 on both macOS and Windows.

Best,
  John

   I hope so too. The (annoying) workaround is to compact the vignette 
yourself (using qpdf directly or using tools::compactPDF), then use 
no-build-vignettes.  The problem there is whatever's supposed to happen 
with building vignette indices.  The uuuuugly workaround, I guess, is to 
build the tarball, compact the vignettes oneself, then *replace* them in 
the tarball.  (Obviously I can automate that, but it seems as though it 
would be unnecessary if I knew what was going on ...)

   cheers
    Ben

I've used both of these workarounds and agree that it would be nice to 
avoid them. After all, what is the --compact-vignettes argument for?

  John

I don't know the answer to your question, but you can debug the 
--compact-vignettes option as follows.

debug(tools::compactPDF)
tools:::.build_packages(c("--compact-vignettes", "pkgdir"))

where "pkgdir" is the directory of the source of your package.  Add 
extra options to the build as separate elements of the argument to 
.build():  this function is called after args have been parsed.

When I do that, I see that it rejects the compaction, because none of 
mine benefit much from it:  it wants at least a 10% and 10K reduction. 
But Ben's example met those criteria.  When I trick it into accepting 
the compaction, it does put the compacted PDF into the tarball.

   Thanks for the tip, I'll take a look.

   Given that three relatively experienced package authors all seem to 
have experienced similar issues, it seems that maybe this is worth 
figuring out/maybe I'm not just doing something boneheaded.

   cheers

Just to clarify:  I've never noticed the problem you mention.  I just 
know how to debug R CMD build.

   I wasn't saying you had. My count of three was Bolker (me), Fox, Nash.

   OK, I think I see the problem. tl;dr use --compact-vignettes="both" 
when building the vignettes.

   --compact-vignettes  by default only tries qpdf.

   when the R CMD check --as-cran is run, it tries both qpdf and gs. 
Since gs (apparently, in this case) compresses more aggressively than 
qpdf, it succeeds in compressing further, and the check complains.

 From R CMD build --help:

  --compact-vignettes=  try to compact PDF files under inst/doc:
                         "no" (default), "qpdf", "gs", "gs+qpdf", "both"
   --compact-vignettes   same as --compact-vignettes=qpdf


   I don't know if this is worth documenting somewhere, or modifying the 
behaviour to make "both" the default for --compact-vignettes ?

Thank you,  Ben, John (2x), and Duncan.

I agree this should be investigated and fixed if/where needed.
My personal experience is that PDF compaction "has worked for
me" mostly, but not always; I think I never had looked closely
when it did not work, and yes, I know I also had used manual
compaction when I was unhappy with the automatic one.

Given that lme4 takes relatively long, and also given Duncan
Murdoch's precise instruction on how to debug,
could you try to find a  as small as "possible"  repr.example?
Of course it needs a vignette whose pdf is relatively large or
rather "well compactable", but otherwise could also be an
artificial package.

Dear Ben,

Actually, what I used was --compact-vignettes="both", with qpdf and gs 
installed on my Windows and Mac machines, and that apparently didn't 
work for me.

Best,
  John

   Huh, weird. "both" worked for me.

   My debugging process involved instrumenting the compression function 
to report what it was doing (see below), rebuilding R, and running the 
build and check --as-cran processes again. (If the package you're 
experiencing problems with is public, feel free to point me to it and 
I'll try to take a look.)

   cheers
    Ben

Hi both,

I am not sure if this might be the issue here, but I think on both
Linux and Windows I need to use the both option without quotation
marks: --compact-vignettes=both

Best,
Henrik

When I tried that on MacOS, it did the gs compression with gs_quality 
set to "none", which does nothing.  I don't know what quality CRAN uses, 
but for me setting the environment variable GS_QUALITY=screen made a big 
difference.

Dear all,

First, thank you to everyone who responded.

Let me be more specific about what I did, focusing on macOS (since I did 
most of this on Windows too):

(1) I observed the problem with the Rcmdr package, including version 
2.7-1, which is newly on CRAN. Presumably, it wouldn't be hard to 
duplicate what I did.

(2) I previously tried both --compact-vignettes="both", 
--compact-vignettes=both, and also just --compact-vignettes. R CMD build 
says that it's "* compacting vignettes and other PDF files", and R CMD 
check --as-cran doesn't complain, reporting "* checking sizes of PDF 
files under ?inst/doc? ... OK."

(3) Nothing changes when, following Duncan's advice, I set GS_QUALITY=screen

In the tarball built by R CMD build, the vignette in 
inst/doc/Getting-Started-with-the-Rcmdr.pdf is 1.6 MB. When I compacted 
the vignette with Adobe Acrobat, it was reduced to 395 KB.

Putting all of this together, I suspect that Acrobat may just do a 
better job than gs and qpdf.

Best,
  John

Dear all,

My NutrienTrackeR package has recently failed to install on the Windows builder machine with R-devel, with an error saying 'rlang' is not available (https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/R.check/r-devel-windows-ix86+x86_64/NutrienTrackeR-00install.html).

Is this something I could fix on my side, or is it just on the builder machine's side?

Thanks a lot in advance

Best wishes,

Rafa

Looks to me like it's just the CRAN machine that had a glitch. I 
wouldn't worry about it unless CRAN asks you to do something, or you're 
submitting a new version.  In the latter case, mention the failure in 
your submission message and say that you're assuming it's a problem on 
their end.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Static vignettes / bibtex warning in Debian
Message-ID: <B9D3F189-2B96-4D03-A43A-AC3F31D596ED@contoso.com>

Hello,

I?m trying to include a static vignette by embedding a pdf document in latex. The procedure is very simple and is discussed here: http://www.markvanderloo.eu/yaRb/2019/01/11/add-a-static-pdf-vignette-to-an-r-package
It essentially boils down to creating a .Rnw file with the following content:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{pdfpages}
%\VignetteIndexEntry{author2019mypaper}

\begin{document}
\includepdf[pages=-, fitpaper=true]{mypaper.pdf}
\end{document}

I built and checked the package with no issues. However, upon uploading to CRAN, Debian generates 1 warning:

Flavor: r-devel-linux-x86_64-debian-gcc
Check: package dependencies, Result: WARNING
  Requires (indirectly) orphaned package: 'bibtex'

I don?t know how to go around this issue. Essentially: how to add a static (pdf) vignette to a package that will pass all CRAN checks?
Your advice is much appreciated.

Thanks,
Juli?n

That WARNING is unlikely to be related to the vignette.  The problem is 
that you have Depends/Imports/Suggests for some R package that does the 
same for the bibtex package (possibly with one ore more other indirect 
steps).

Since this is only on one platform, it's probably not something you need 
to worry about:  that other package has probably been updated to drop 
the bibtex dependence, but Debian hasn't got the update yet.

I don't know how you determine which is the "guilty" package.  Maybe 
there are more hints in the check log?

Hello, All:


	  "R CMD check Ecfun_0.2-4.tar.gz" fails under Windows 10 with "Error: 
package or namespace load failed for 'Ecfun': .onLoad failed in 
loadNamespace() for 'rJava'".


	  However, I cannot find where Ecfun calls rJava.  This is in:


https://github.com/sbgraves237/Ecfun

	
	  I get nothing from "grep 'rJava'" in the DESCRIPTION and NAMESPACE 
files plus in the man and R subdirectories.  I ran 
tools:package_dependencies recursively starting with Ecfun until I got 
all NULLs and could not find rJava anywhere.

You need to include suggested package dependencies in your search.

tools::package_dependencies("Ecfun",
  which = c("Depends", "Imports", "LinkingTo", "Suggests"),
  recursive = TRUE)

You will find rJava in that list of ~1650 dependencies.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Procedure for the transfer or an R package
 maintainership
Message-ID: <20201011142000.i5lh4ra27p4v6ndx@localhost.localdomain>

Dear R-devel-community!


The current maintainer of the 'nephro' R-package
(https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nephro/index.html), Cristian
Pattaro, asked me if I'm willing to take over this work.  I'm very
interested in stepping in but since I've never done something similar
before I'd like to ask for some advice.


I read on stackoverflow
(https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39223320/transferring-maintainership-of-an-r-package-on-cran)
that the standard procedure is (in the following order):

* a message from the old maintainers' email address stating the change
  in maintainership

* a change in the DESCRIPTION file with the address of the new
  maintainer information.


But I'm interested in the steps afterwards (see also
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64299121/what-do-i-have-to-do-if-im-taking-over-the-maintenance-of-a-gnu-r-package-publi):

* How can I 'link' this package to a new repository on the version
  control platform of my choice (e.g. https://gitlab.com/ or
  https://github.com)?

* How do the package update procedures on CRAN work (e.g. if I want to
  create a new version of the package)?

* How does the update procedure for the repository on r-forge (in my
  case: https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/nephro/) work?  Is this
  identical to the CRAN-package?


I looked into https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html as
well https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html but I couldn't
find an answer to my questions.


Best wishes, 

Alex

Hello Spencer

Just a wild guess: the CRAN version of your package
does not list 'xlsx'; but your GitHub version does.
Now, 'xlsx' depends on 'rJava'.  So perhaps start there?

As I said, only a wild guess; but maybe it helps.

Kind regards
    Enrico

Just change any documentation in the package that points to the wrong 
place.  In particular, this will include the URL: field in the 
DESCRIPTION file, but it may show up in help pages or vignettes as well.

That's described quite clearly here:

https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html

And you *must* create a new version of the package for the maintainer 
change to take effect.  Depending on how many other changes you are 
planning for it, you could make the minimal changes now, and bigger ones 
a month or two later, or wait until everything is ready.

r-forge uses Subversion, so to update the package there, just change 
your working copy and commit the changes.  You'll need to be registered 
as a project member with sufficient privileges to do this; that 
registration needs to be done by someone with admin permissions.

Hopefully I've added enough info for you.

   Thanks, but I don't think that's the problem because:

    (1) Those are reported as being from the last released version, not 
this one.
    (2) As far as I can tell from my local tests, I'm pretty sure I've 
fixed these issues in the current release.
    (3) In my experience UBSAN tests don't generally get re-run for a 
while after the initial CRAN testing anyway ...

   cheers

You are right. I was too fast and didn't read "last released version".
Then the only suspicious thing I see is:

Overall checktime 23 min > 10 min

There's this one in 
https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/lme4_1.1-24_20201012_210730/Windows/00check.log:

   Comparing 'lmer-1.Rout' to 'lmer-1.Rout.save' ...428d427
< boundary (singular) fit: see ?isSingular
430d428
< boundary (singular) fit: see ?isSingular

Those messages about the singular fit show up in

https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/lme4_1.1-24_20201012_210730/Windows/examples_and_tests/tests_i386/lmer-1.Rout 


but not in

https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/lme4_1.1-24_20201012_210730/Windows/examples_and_tests/tests_i386/lmer-1.Rout.save

The difference also doesn't show up in the x64 versions of the files.

   I agree that's unfortunate, but it doesn't seem grounds for summary 
rejection ... ?  (CRAN policy says "Checking the package should take as 
little CPU time as possible".)  You may be right: it does seem to be _de 
facto_ policy that any NOTE is grounds for rejection.  On the other 
hand, this package has had NOTEs about 'installed size is <large>" for a 
long time, which hasn't been grounds for rejection.

Large size due to libs. But if data or docs go beyond 5MB, it would
probably be rejected. Likewise, I believe checking time is another one
of those NOTEs that are really hard lines.

   OK, thanks.

   I did notice this in passing (I think), but I got confused by the 
format.  (Also, it doesn't even rise to the level of a NOTE ...)

   It took me a while to localize the problem (line numbers have to be 
computing _after_ throwing away the R header info, see source code of 
tools::Rdiff()).

    Having spent this long reading tea leaves, I think I'm going to 
write to the CRAN maintainers for clarification.

   * Refactoring all the tests to decrease the testing time 
significantly is certainly possible (at worst I can make a lot of stuff 
conditionally skipped on CRAN), but would be a nuisance that I'd rather 
save for the next release if possible.

   * Eliminating the two lines of variable output is easy, but it's 
mildly annoying to update the version number for this small a correction 
...

   Looks like from now on there will only be odd-numbered releases of 
lme4 on CRAN, since I seem guaranteed to make trivial errors with my 
first (odd-numbered) try each time and have to bump the version number 
when fixing them ...

Actually more than 23 minutes check time for a single package is really 
excessive, can you pls cut that down?

This comes from

** running tests for arch 'i386' ... [509s] OK
** running tests for arch 'x64' ... [501s] OK

so only tests take 1010 seconds already.

I see that lme4 is a really important package that may justify some 
extra check time, but this is really a lot.

Can you please reduce the check time in the tests? e.g. using toy data 
and few iterations? Or by running less important tests only 
conditionally if some environment variable is set that you only define 
on your machine?

Best,
Uwe Ligges

   Sure.  I assume I should aim for <10 minutes since that's the 
threshold for a NOTE ...  (for what it's worth the tests take a bit less 
than 25% as long on my Linux laptop, since an individual test run is 
more than twice as fast and we only have to check one architecture ...)

   Do I interpret correctly that the advice is to address this problem, 
bump the version number, and re-submit?

   cheers

Yes, failing to match saved test output should be a fatal error, but 
isn't marked as one.

One of my favourite programs back in the days when I used Windows was 
Beyond Compare (https://www.scootersoftware.com/).  They've had a Mac 
version for a while now; it works well too (though I kind of prefer the 
old Windows UI a bit for some reason).  It made it really easy to find 
this difference, once I figured out which files to compare.  I didn't 
even recognize the line numbers in the CRAN report as line numbers at first.

I'd say a mismatch in saved output isn't a small problem, it's either a 
too-sensitive test or something serious.

   That's fair enough, but it would be nice if (1) this were a NOTE and 
(2) it were made explicit in the CRAN policy that, *except by special 
exception*, an unresolved NOTE is grounds for rejection.  This is 
broadly understood by experienced package maintainers but must sometimes 
come as a shock to newbies ...

I don't think so.  As I said, I think it should be marked as an ERROR.

   OK.  But it would probably be wise (if the CRAN maintainers actually 
wanted to do this) to crank it up from silent -> NOTE -> WARNING -> 
ERROR over the course of several releases so as not to have widespread 
test failures on CRAN right away ...

Do you think so?  Why would you put saved results into the package 
unless you want to test if they match?

Honestly, I thought this had always been a fatal error.

   My point was just that it would be disruptive to switch the severity 
of such mismatches from 'message, no NOTE' to 'ERROR' in a single step - 
I'd imagine it could lead to a very large number of CRAN packages 
suddenly failing their tests.

Hold on, are we sure this is detected at all? The result of the tests
is reported as OK. The "singular fit" message goes to stderr, so my
guess is that it is not compared against the saved output at all.

It is reported in the 00check.log file; I gave the link to the report.

I think it's a bug in the check code that the check log reports OK at 
the end, when (what should be) a fatal error has been displayed.

) because I could not solve an issue with OpenMP and Fortran on MACOS.

I have seen that packages with C add precompilation conditions, for
instance:

https://github.com/tesujimath/R-OpenMPController/blob/86bd047e8bfdf3c87877336ff8e2d3b69327fe03/src/omp_set_num_threads_ptr.c#L12

#ifdef _OPENMP
  omp_set_num_threads(*np);
#endif

So, I tried adding those lines in #ifdef _OPENMP #endif in
fortran, with the flag -cpp and the MACROS recommended by the R EXTS manual:

USE_FC_TO_LINK =
PKG_FFLAGS = $(SHLIB_OPENMP_FFLAGS) *-cpp*
PKG_LIBS = $(SHLIB_OPENMP_FFLAGS)

But with R CMD Check i got the message:

Non-portable flags in variable 'PKG_FFLAGS': -cpp

I would be very grateful if someone provides me some guidelines. Thank you
so much

Best, Sergio

I?m sure that you have done this, but did you set a compiler option of
-fopenmp, please?

Thanks

Message-ID: <df442db0-0a0e-c681-d5d6-8a1e673e9087@bebac.at>

Dear all,

in one of my packages I import from package xlsx, which itself imports 
rJava.
I have the current Java (jre1.8.0_261) installed:
  ? JAVA_VERSION="1.8.0_261"
  ? OS_NAME="Windows"
  ? OS_VERSION="5.2"
  ? OS_ARCH="amd64"

However:
  ? devtools::session_info("rJava")
  ? - Session info

  ?? setting? value
  ?? version? R version 4.0.3 (2020-10-10)

  ?? ui?????? Rgui
  ?? language EN
  ?? collate? German_Germany.1252
  ?? ctype??? German_Germany.1252
  ?? tz?????? Europe/Vienna
  ?? date???? 2020-10-13

  ? - Packages

  ?? D rJava???? 0.9-13? 2020-07-06 [1] CRAN (R 4.0.2)

  ? [1] D:/Program Files/R/R-4.0.3/library

  ?? D -- DLL MD5 mismatch, broken installation.

I found only this: 
https://community.rstudio.com/t/error-dll-md5-mismatch-broken-installation/64141 
with no answer.

Deleted rJava from my library and made a new install, no avail.

The functions I need from xlsx work as intended but I'm worried a bit.

Make sure you quit from all R sessions before you reinstall rJava, and
also that it is not loaded in the current session.

You can also run tools::checkMD5sums("rJava") to check the MD5 sums.

In case you were unaware there is also openxlsx which may be sufficient for
your import/export needs, and which is does not need a Java toolchain.

I'm, sorry but I don't understand your question. To my understanding,
adding the mentioned MACROS should be enough to add the flag -fopenmp.
Actually, when I build the package, gfortran already uses the flag -fopenmp:

gfortran -fno-optimize-sibling-calls *-fopenmp* -fpic  -g -O2
-fdebug-prefix-map=/build/r-base-8T8CYO/r-base-4.0.3=.
-fstack-protector-strong  -c  get_threads.f90 -o get_threads.o

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] checking windows timing?
Message-ID: <a9f3300c-ed86-7487-753f-416cb0fce7b7@gmail.com>


   Following up on my questions from yesterday:

   I've been advised to (drastically) reduce the checking time of my 
package on CRAN's Windows platform (currently at 23 min). I've gone 
through and added a lot of conditionals to skip tests on CRAN.  I could 
reduce it farther but I'm starting to encounter seriously diminishing 
returns, e.g.

  * do I condition out some particular test that takes 6 seconds? (e.g., 
a little slow, but not egregious)
  * do I put \dontrun{} around an example that takes 6 seconds [I'm a 
bit confused about this, but as I understand it CRAN checks with 
--run-donttest ? \dontrun{} also sometimes provokes complaints from 
CRAN, because "you should only use \dontrun{} for code that cannot be 
run by users" ...]

   I don't want to spend forever tweaking things, and I don't want to 
comment/condition out all of my tests, but I would really prefer to 
avoid bouncing from CRAN again. I don't know a *reliable* way to test 
whether CRAN-checking on Windows will take <10 mins or not ...

   I don't have a local Windows test platform.

   win-builder gives timings for long-running components, but not for 
the whole run.

   r-hub gives a time for the entire build (19 min in my case) - but 
this includes the time to set up the virtual machine, install all 
packages, etc..

   I can approximately predict that most examples and tests will take 
twice as long on CRAN's windows machines (and four times as long since 
tests, at least, are checked on both i386 and x86_64 architectures).

   Testing is currently taking 6 minutes on my local machine (newish 
Ubuntu 18.04 laptop), so I guess have more work to do, but I wonder if 
anyone has suggestions ...

   cheers

FWIW, we dealt with the tests-taking-too-long problem for CVXR (which 
has a lot of tests) by mercilessly cutting out all tests on CRAN 
(testthat::skip_on_cran()) except for some fundamental ones on atoms, 
curvature, etc.? We then rely on Github actions (with NOT_CRAN = true) 
to run the full test suite on several platforms. Not perfect, but that's 
what worked for us.

Really don't use \dontrun{}.  You'll stop running those examples
even for the users of  your package who  do

     example(<some>)

Rather do use an environment variable - based setup (as Uwe
mentioned).

In several packages of mine, I use

if(<pkg>:::doExtras()) { 
  ...  ## longer running examples / tests
}

sometimes also using withAutoprint({ .... })  which is important
when the longer running code is producing output that I'd want
to continue showing.


In my 'robustbase' package, I have somewhere in robustbase/R/<foo>.R

## Not exported, and only used because CRAN checks must be faster
doExtras <- function() {
    interactive() || nzchar(Sys.getenv("R_robustbase_check_extra")) ||
        identical("true", unname(Sys.getenv("R_PKG_CHECKING_doExtras")))
}

so doExtras()  is true for me,  *either* if I set the

package-specific        R_robustbase_check_extra  variable to non-empty
*or* the more global    R_PKG_CHECKING_doExtras   variable to non-empty.

That way, I can have all these check running in my own checks
(say by default, but can turn them off by unsetting the env.var.)

and yes, I use  doExtras  extensively in the tests, but very
much on purpose also in examples, there sometimes  combined with

 if(interactive()) { ... }

which keeps help page examples running interactively, but not in
'R CMD check' ..

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] C++ library USING_R
Message-ID: <16c3b09f-031b-5dce-643d-d292894481b5@IEEE.org>

Dear R-devel,

The Writing R Extensions manual states:

6.14 Platform and version information
The header files define USING_R, which can be used to test if the code 
is indeed being used with R.

I suppose this only applies to building R itself?? Or, perhaps when Rcpp 
is used for the interface, or if one includes R headers explicitly.

I have a C++ library that is built with no R-dependencies, then wrapped 
with an Rcpp interface. This same library is wrapped with pybind11 in 
the Python world, and directly used in C++ applications.

How can the C++ library code "know" that it's R building the library? Is 
there a platform-independent environment variable or macro?

Thanks.

So if I have this right you have

  - a library LIB using only standard C++ components

  - that you wrapped into a Python package via pybind11, and

  - that you want to build for R and 'let it know it used for R'

Well I think you would then use a (wrapper) R package R_LIB and could set up
a -DR_BUILD in the src/Makevars for R_LIB. This presume that you actually
recompile LIB as part of the build; if you were to link with a static or
shared build then you could not do this _for lack of a subsequent
compilation_ and can only rely on run-time information.

Hope this helps, and that I didn't misunderstand the question.

Dirk

Apologies for the mis-directed reply, and, imprecise syntax/context re 
environment variable.

Just to close the loop, it seems that using a -D macro assignment inside 
the make command (macro?) is interpreted as a make option:

$(LIBEDM):
 ??? @(cd $(CPPEDM_SRC_PATH) && $(MAKE) clean && $(MAKE) \
 ??? CXX="$(CXX11) $(CXX11STD)" CXXFLAGS="$(CXX11FLAGS) $(CXX11PICFLAGS)" \
 ??? AR="$(AR)" RANLIB="$(RANLIB)" -DUSING_R=1)

...

 ?? make[1]: Entering directory 
'/tmp/RtmpxVmJkT/Rbuild1553f22c7484d/rEDM/src/cppEDM/src'
 ?? rm -f API.o CCM.o Common.o DateTime.o EDM.o EDM_Formatting.o 
EDM_Neighbors.o Eval.o Multiview.o Parameter.o Simplex.o SMap.o libEDM.a
 ?? make[1]: Leaving directory 
'/tmp/RtmpxVmJkT/Rbuild1553f22c7484d/rEDM/src/cppEDM/src'
 ?? make: invalid option -- 'D'

Hmm... since I use an R-specific makefile inside the C++ library 
directory anyway, adding -DUSING_R there seems like a decent solution.

Thanks a-million for the support & guidance to get me to the obvious 
solution!

Yes, exactly, that was my initial suggestion. It's been a while since I
needed this but when do I tend to just go back to simple examples to check I
am on the right track:

   edd at rob:/tmp$ g++ -o io io.cpp; ./io         # default: empty
   Hello boring world
   edd at rob:/tmp$ g++ -DFOO -o io io.cpp; ./io   # with a defined 
   We see foo
   edd at rob:/tmp$ cat io.cpp
   #include <iostream>
   
   int main() {
   #if defined(FOO)
     std::cout << "We see foo\n";
   #else
     std::cout << "Hello boring world\n";
   #endif
   }
   edd at rob:/tmp$ 
   
So setting -Dsomething is really equivalent to doing in the code via #define
but allows you to have it done conditional on when/where/how you compile.

No worries. Is your repo public?  Good _portable_ cross-language solutions
are rare, it would be good to have another one to look at / refer people to.

Message-ID: <CAJmOi+P+x9=1TS-STHccdO7Mibbt0ftNvDLwrz5fKt-=7i3aZA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am getting a UBSAN-clang failure on my package hutilscpp
(<https://github.com/HughParsonage/hutilscpp>). However I cannot
reproduce the error on rhub, nor can I see an obvious problem with the
code.  (Though obviously there is something wrong.)

The testthat.Rout log from CRAN reads (relevantly):

> test_check("hutilscpp")

The RcppExports.cpp 647:65 refers to the commented line starting
"rcpp_result_gen" below
// do_which_first__
R_xlen_t do_which_first__(SEXP x, int op, SEXP y, R_xlen_t nx,

rcpp_result_gen = Rcpp::wrap(do_which_first__(x, op, y, nx, ny, y1i,
y2i, y1d, y2d)); // line 647, column 65 is between nx and ny
return rcpp_result_gen;
END_RCPP
}

The ny R_xlen_t value is used in a switch statement in the C++ code.
My attempt to fix this code was to limit the values of ny to 1, 2, or
3 before being passed to do_which_first__().  However, since I was not
able to reproduce the UBSAN error on rhub I'm not sure if this fix is
successful.  I would prefer not to submit a package before being
completely sure the UBSAN error has been resolved.


Thank you for any help,


Hugh.

Hugh,

The different SAN/ASAB/UBSAN/... analysers depend critically on _exactly how_
the instrumentation is setup.  That make the whole setup analysis a little
brittle, and it is a real shame that neither CRAN nor some of the entities
supposedly here in order to support R users and developers have managed to
produced _standardized_ environments (using, say, Docker) to make this
genuinely reproducible. So we all waste time chasing things over and over.

Five or so years ago I wrote a first container for this; I believe the RHub
one is a descendant of it. But I found reproducing errors so tricky that I
set up an entire package just to provide 'true positives' for such tests of
the testing framework:   http://cloud.r-project.org/package=sanitizers
It helps validate that the setup (container, say) catches what it is supposed
to catch--as this is (too) easy to get wrong.

These days I think the contains within the (very well done and complete)
"collection" of containers maintained by Winston might be your best bet:
  https://github.com/wch/r-debug
This is what I used last time I needed something like it.

Hth, Dirk

To add to Dirk's summary of the available options, you might find it useful
to borrow from the setup that we use to replicate CRAN's UBSAN checks on
GitHub Actions for {lightgbm}.

https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/blob/0c1c36cdbdf771a03c9ae0873eb28585e6c3d624/.github/workflows/r_package.yml#L162-L186

I was able to reproduce all of the specific issues in {lightgbm} that
showed up on CRAN's UBSAN checks with this setup, which uses the
rhub/rocker-gcc-san image. It should be easy enough to switch that to the
images from https://github.com/wch/r-debug if necessary.

Hope that it helps!

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Check: for detritus in the temp directory,
 Result: NOTE
Message-ID: <38DD2D82-419D-41A2-BB09-0A1C9940CA8A@win-vector.com>


I am trying to move the wrapr package from RUnit to tinytest. All seemed well on my tests, but when I submitted to CRAN I got:

Flavor: r-devel-linux-x86_64-debian-gcc
Check: for detritus in the temp directory, Result: NOTE
  Found the following files/directories:
    'Rscript2be2.9jpLCF' 'Rscript2be3.i3ORSI' 'Rscript2bff.JJwTqS'
    'Rscript2c00.PBV2DW'

Does anybody know what this is a symptom of, or how to fix it?

Thanks,
  John

Yes, it helps.  I removed that dependency, and the package now passes "R

Hi all,

The CRAN incoming Dashboard indicates that the status of my package (r5r)
is "pending", which means 'the CRAN maintainers are waiting for an action
on your side. You should check your emails!'.

However, I haven't received any email with guidance on how to proceed. Is
there any CRAN webpage to check the latest check results and get a sense of
what I should be doing?

best,

Rafael Pereira

AFAICT the text there is wrong: it corresponds to state 'waiting' as
'pending' means CRAN is pondering the state of the package.

Your package has only been there for three (mostly weekend) days which is
nothing. I have one 'waiting' for five days now and it is simply (AFAICT) a
false positive. Plus, it had already been delayed by a spurious compilation
error on their end before that so the total is well over a week now. Very
frustrating.  But there is exactly zero you or I can do about it.

No.

I can only suggest to trust official documentation (Writing R Extensions,
CRAN Repository Policy) more. Asking here is also better than guessing.

Hello,

Usually such problems with pkgdown will come from your pkgdown configuration. I see (thanks to a search engine :-) and sorry if my search result is wrong ) that you actually write to exclude all articles

* your configuration https://github.com/maRce10/warbleR/blob/7c313bd4388c908df9055a952badca8605b75468/pkgdown/_pkgdown.yml#L4 (btw you also have a file called pkgdown.yml there, that is probably useless?)
* documentation of how to configure the articles index https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/reference/build_articles.html#index-and-navbar
So you'll need to either remove the "articles" field from your configuration (to use the default ordering etc.) or add more information to it, following the docs.

As to why this did not happen before, I'd assume it is the articles index was added fairly recently https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2020/03/pkgdown-1-5-0/#articles

Best wishes

Ma?lle.

PS: For questions directly related to pkgdown I'd tend to rather post on https://community.rstudio.com/c/package-development/11

Hi all,

this is a bit tricky since the documentation on the dashboard comes from 
an official, authoritative, source: the R journal [1].

"pending: if a decision is pending a response from the package 
maintainer: If an additional issue was present in the package that we 
cannot check for in the incoming checks (such as the BLAS issues 
mentioned in the section above), the maintainer is automatically asked 
whether these issues have been fixed. Same is true for change of 
maintainer (or maintainer's mail address) where the old maintainer (old 
address) is automatically asked to confirm the maintainer change. The 
answers have to be processed manually."

As Dirk explains and as reported in 
https://github.com/lockedata/cransays/issues/29, it is likely not true 
anymore but in the absence of further official information, it is 
difficult to issue a fix.

A later issue of the R journal [2] introduces the "waiting" and 
"newbies" categories but does not expand on the new role of "pending".

Best,

Hugo

Thank you  Dirk and Hugo for your responses. I guess I'll just have to be
patient and wait.

I can only imagine how the CRAN team is overwhelmed by the exponential
growth of package submissions. I wonder, though, whether the CRAN
maintainers and the R community more broadly are thinking about
alternatives to deal with such growing demand without compromising the
speed and consistency/quality of package development. Expanding the team of
CRAN maintainers would be the most obvious solution but I confess I'm not
familiar enough with the whole process to assess what would be the best
routes of action to tackle this bottleneck.

	  From my experience, it looks to me like their primary approach to 
handling the increased volume has been to improve automation.  In the 
spirit of brainstorming, I'd like to share other ideas on this:


MAKE IT EASY FOR A USER TO CHECK A DIFF FILE OF "Writing R Extensions" 
COMPARING THE CURRENT VERSION WITH ANY PREVIOUS ONE.


	  For example, every article on Wikipedia has a "View History" tab. 
That lists the dates of all the revisions with a terse summary of what 
was changed in each.  I can click on any two and then click "Compare" to 
see all the changes in that period.


	  I'm not going to reread every word of "Writing R Extensions" every 
time I submit something to CRAN.  However, I would be willing to review 
a diff file if it were easy for me to do that.  (And I'm NOT going to 
create my own private file copy of "Writing R Extensions" and manually 
create such a diff file.)


IMPROVE THE COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE CRAN TEAM AND OTHER DOCUMENTATION 
OF HOW TO PREPARE A PACKAGE FOR CRAN


	  I know two sources of information on that:


		    * Wickham and Bryan, R Packages (https://r-pkgs.org).  I created a 
"cran-comments.md" file based on their recommendations, and missed their 
comment that it should be in ".Rbuildignore".  My latest CRAN submission 
was rejected partly because of that.


		    * Colin Fay, "Preparing your package for a CRAN submission" 
(https://github.com/ThinkR-open/prepare-for-cran).  These instructions 
follow Wickham and Bryan in recommending "devtools::revdep_check()". 
Sadly, "revdep_check" is not currently in devtools but in a package 
called revdepcheck.  Worse, that package is not available on CRAN and 
appears twice on GitHub.  The original by bbolker has not been updated 
in 5 years.  The version that is currently maintained is 
"https://github.com/r-lib/revdepcheck".  Fortunately, Hadley Wickham is 
the leading contributor to the latter, so writing him may help correct 
that infelicity, but I should also write to Colin Fay.


CRAN REVIEW GROUPS:  There are now 41 different "CRAN Task Views".  We 
could ask the maintainer of each Task View to try to recruit a committee 
around each one to discuss coverage and integration.  Each committee 
could be asked to coordinate via email and in virtual meetings.  They 
could be asked to pick 3 standard times for their virtual meetings, so 
anyone in the world would not always be excluded from a meeting that was 
3 AM their time.  Each package maintainer would be asked to specify at 
least one "Task View" for each package and be willing to discuss 
overlap, etc., with others.  This might be a topic for the next useR 
conference.

   My 'revdepcheck' is obsolete, superseded by r-lib/revdepcheck (which 
it does predate by about a year ...)

  Dirk Eddelbuettel maintains an automated system for diffs of the CRAN 
repository policy https://github.com/eddelbuettel/crp , or follow 
@CRANPolicyWatch -- similar to your idea about WRE diffs.

  You can view a history of WRE (with diffs) at 
https://github.com/wch/r-source/commits/trunk/doc/manual/R-exts.texi

   I believe CRAN has devoted some resources to hiring editorial 
assistants who handle some of the lower-level tasks ...

That's already pretty easy on the sources, using svn diff.  The user 
just needs to be comfortable using svn.

For example, assuming you have R-devel checked out, run this to see 
what's changed since Jan 1, 2020:

  svn diff -r {2020-01-01} doc/manual/R-exts.texi

You can do it without checking out a copy with some more typing:

  svn diff -r {2020-01-01} 
--old=https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/doc/manual/R-exts.texi

There are probably online web services that do this, but I do have it 
checked out, so I'm not very interested in them.

Keeping documentation up to date is hard, and maintaining a productive 
collaboration is even harder.  I don't think even writing the suggestion 
in ALL CAPS is enough to bring this about ;-).

I would suggest a more modest goal:  pick one task view in which you 
have an interest, and work to improve it.  Then move on to the next one...

Most of the contributors to R are reasonable people, but they have their 
own priorities.  If you can make it easier for them to achieve their 
priorities, they'll appreciate it.  If you ask them to change their 
priorities, they might not.

Message-ID: <CAO2Ag_tDqn1yZYjH+a8Dto-m3Oyc=N=3DfjdMz+qcHMxLDpr-g@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am trying to submit a package to CRAN, but it failed the auto checks at
win-builder.r-project.org with errors that I do not know how to fix. My
package uses Tensorflow for R, which in turn requires a Python installation
of Tensorflow. I am unsure of how to get R / reticulate to find the Python
installations on other machines automatically. Here are the two error
messages that I get:

*Debian*:

Error: Installation of TensorFlow not found.
Python environments searched for 'tensorflow' package:
 /usr/bin/python3.8
You can install TensorFlow using the install_tensorflow() function.

It seems best to avoid using the "install_tensorflow()" function, and I
have followed the instructions at
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/reticulate/vignettes/python_dependencies.html
including making changes to the DESCRIPTION file and .onLoad function, but
to no avail.

*Windows*:

Error in python_config(miniconda_python, NULL, miniconda_python) :
  Error 2 occurred running
C:/Users/ligges/AppData/Local/r-miniconda/envs/r-reticulate/python.exe

I am not familiar with reticulate, and do not know what "Error 2" refers
to. This error occurs every time a test tries to use "tensorflow::" or
"keras::". I would be very grateful if someone could help me solve this
issue.

Thank you!

Message-ID: <88585e3c-dacd-7643-abe5-387c658beba2@helmholtz-muenchen.de>

Dear all,

last week I tried to upload for the first time a package to CRAN but my 
submission was refused:

Flavor: r-devel-linux-x86_64-debian-gcc
Check: for detritus in the temp directory, Result: NOTE
 ? Found the following files/directories:
 ??? 'Rscript2a22.5sWrxM' 'Rscript2a30.B2JkNS'

On the Windows machine of CRAN this error did not occur, nor did it 
occur on my ubuntu PC, and I was also not able to reproduce it on R-hub. 
The CRAN output can be found at:

https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/msce_1.0.0_20201016_101418/ 


I have no idea about possible sources of this error. Could anybody 
please give me a hint?

Thanks

This was a bug in R-devel, already fixed.
(specific to Unix, and only 3 R-devel revisions)

Sorry for the inconvenience,
Tomas

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Usage of internet resources in examples
Message-ID: <67D95F17-1341-40A5-9DEA-EB3AB45EBE29@gmail.com>

Our package bcdata (https://cran.r-project.org/package=bcdata) retrieves public data from British Columbia data services, so the examples are dependent on successfully hitting web resources. When we initially submitted to CRAN the examples were wrapped in \dontrun{}, but we were asked to change them to use \donttest{}.

 
Now, CRAN is running checks with _R_CHECK_DONTTEST_EXAMPLES_=true, and one of the examples has failed due to a changed web resource. I got an email asking me to fix it and reminding me of the CRAN policy:
 

  'Packages which use Internet resources should fail gracefully with an informative message

 if the resource is not available or has changed (and not give a check warning nor error).'

  This needs correction whether or not the resource recovers.

 
I would prefer that in normal use, the function calling the internet resources fails with an error so that the user is properly alerted. I also agree that these failures shouldn't cause a check error. To demonstrate the use of these functions in examples, is there a preferred method of ensuring that failures will not cause a check warning or error? Should I try to revert back to using \dontrun{} and plead my case? Wrap in `if interactive())`?
 

Thanks very much,

Andy Teucher

   Depending on what you want to do,

   if (interactive())

or

   try()  (in the examples, not in the function)

or

   if (testthat::skip_on_cran())

all seem like reasonable solutions.

I don't think you can use `testthat::skip_on_cran()` for this, it does
not return a logical flag:

? isTRUE(testthat::skip_on_cran())
Error: Reason: On CRAN

It only works in testthat tests.

   oh OK, sorry.  The guts of the function are (in testthat:::on_cran(), 
which can't be used because it's not exported)

!identical(Sys.getenv("NOT_CRAN"), "true")

It is not really worth exporting this, because it just checks for an
environment variable, that's all it does. So all users would need to
set this environment variable to be able to run the examples. Which
does not seem like a great solution.

I set \dontrun{} on (most of) the examples in my Azure-related packages, for this very reason. They assume the user has an Azure subscription, and in any case, you don't want to be running code that could potentially cost lots of money just for kicks. The packages in question are basically all those on CRAN that start with "Azure".

I cleared this with Uwe Ligges some time back; although whenever I submit a new package, I tend to get emails from whoever did the review that \donttest() should be removed. I've been able to resolve this by replying and cc'ing Uwe, mentioning that it was approved previously.

Thanks everyone for the responses. I?m not sure why I didn?t think of wrapping the examples in try(), but I think that might be the best solution - allows the examples to be run, but won?t throw errors in R CMD check.

Hong Ooi - that?s a good point though I think your example does fall more squarely into the ?use dontrun? category as they require a subscription/API key. Our examples don?t, but they can fail if the internet connection fails, the resource url changes, or the server is down.

Cheers,
Andy

I still disagree with that part of your recommendations, for this reason:
I think a "perfect" solution would keep the example(s) running
fine when the user calls

     example(<topic>)

(hence it is very good recommendation to  *not* misuse \dontrun{.} here)
*and* have the   example(.)  call  *not* stop on error, but (say)
produce a warning in the case the internet connection isn't
stable at the time the user calls   example(.),
e.g., myself in a train ride in the Swiss alps ..

Hence, your (Ben's) first two suggestions make more sense to me,
and I'd clearly favor

	try(.)

or possibly slightly more sophsticated versions such as

      if(inherits(try({
         .......
         }), "try-error"))  warning(....)

Or then your 2nd suggestion,  if(interactive())
in the case (as it seems here) where the package author
really wants the user to get an error when the internet
connection fails.

Thanks Martin,

I agree that the example should run for a user when calling example() - hence I am going with a simple try() around the function calls in the examples. I agree your more sophisticated version has better behaviour, but I don?t want to clutter the examples with code that might just confuse a user.

Message-ID: <5BADE9C6-684C-4A18-A1A3-6B29F891DD08@me.com>

Hi All,

Just thought that I would check to see if there are any known issues/delays for CRAN in creating R release and devel binaries for Windows for updated packages.

It has been four days since I submitted an update and the other binaries were created within a couple of days. The two Windows binaries are the only outstanding updates pending.

Thanks!

Related to this:

It would be neat to have a dashboard that reports on the current
latency is on the different CRAN "queues" are, e.g. how long is the
average waiting time when submitting a new package ("newbies") until
you get a manual reply or it's on CRAN, submitting an update with all
OK before it hits CRAN, waiting time for building Windows or macOS
binaries, etc.  Some, but not all, of this information can already be
guestimated from the info on ftp://cran.r-project.org/incoming/, on
easier on https://lockedata.github.io/cransays/articles/dashboard.html.
I think this could be a great contributor project - it doesn't have to
be hosted by CRAN.

Hi,

I am developing a package and getting a NOTE from R CMD check about 
licenses and ultimate dependencies on a restrictive license, which I 
can't figure out how to fix.

My package imports flowCore, which has an Artistic-2.0 license.
But flowCore imports cytolib, which has a license from the Fred 
Hutchinson Cancer Center that prohibits commercial use.

I tried using the same license as flowCore, but still get the NOTE. Does 
anyone know which licenses can be used to be compatible with the Fred 
Hutch license? Or can I just do what flowCore apparently does and ignore 
the NOTE?

Thanks,
 ? Kevin

flowCore is a Bioconductor package, not on CRAN.  Are you intending to 
send yours there, or to CRAN?  I suspect Bioconductor is happy with the 
Hutch's license.

Hi Kevin,

I have not looked at BioC's licensing requirements, but presumably, they are ok with the non-commercial use restrictions placed on users of cytolib, thus also on flowCore.

If you want your package to be on CRAN, those restrictions on users are not allowed by CRAN's policy:

https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html

"Such packages are not permitted to require (e.g., by specifying in ?Depends?, ?Imports? or ?LinkingTo? fields) directly or indirectly a package or external software which restricts users or usage."


Thus, you would seem to need to make a decision on hosting your package on CRAN, but without the need to import from flowCore/cytolib, or consider hosting your package on BioC, with the attendant restrictions on commercial use.

Regards,

Marc Schwartz

Hello:


	  With "R CMD check Ecdat_0.3-8.tar.gz" both locally (under macOS 
10.15.7 with R 4.0.3) and with Travis (below), I'm getting "Warning: 
large data files saved inefficiently: ...  significantly better 
compression could be obtained by using R CMD build --resave-data".  This 
is AFTER I do "R CMD build Ecdat --resave-data".


	  What do you suggest I do to get past this problem?


	  Thanks,
	  Spencer Graves


p.s.  My ".travis.yml" file ends with "r_build_args: --resave-data".  I 
had trouble with this a year ago, and I think it was fixed then, as 
documented in:


https://travis-ci.community/t/how-to-add-resave-date-to-r-cmd-build-in-travis/5708

Well....

Now that I look at:

  https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/share/licenses/license.db

there are a few licenses listed there that do place restrictions on commercial use.

These include some Creative Commons Non-Commercial use variants and the ACM license.

Is the license DB file out of date, or is there an apparent conflict with the CRAN policy that I quoted above?

Anyone with an ability to comment?

Regards,

Marc

Presumably CRAN would not accept the non-FOSS licenses that are listed 
in license.db, but R could still do computations on them, as described 
in ?library in the "Licenses" section.

Duncan,

That is a reasonable distinction.

However, upon searching CRAN with available.packages(), I came up with a list of packages that do include Non-Commercial restrictions, including CC BY-NC* and ACM licenses. There may be others that I missed visually scanning the output.

There also appear to be some conflicts/inconsistencies with the 'License_restricts_use' field entry and the 'License' field in some cases, where, for example, most that have "CC BY-NC-SA 4.0" as the license, have "NA" as the entry for restricted use, rather than "yes".

I am not going to list them here, as I don't want to pick on any particular package, but this does seem to point to an inconsistency between packages that are hosted on CRAN and the articulated policy...

Regards,

Marc

It?s necessary but not sufficient to use a licence from license.db

Perhaps those packages were accepted before this became a policy, and 
now that others depend on them, it would be too disruptive to remove 
them, and users are warned via the 'License_restricts_use' field entry. 
Why does it sometimes contain errors?  That I don't know, other than 
blaming it on Murphy's Law.

Hi All:

I am working on a small bug fix in a package,  and on winbuilder_devel  (not on release) I get the following Note:

The problem is https://erddap.marine.ie/erddap  is a valid URL, and is the proper one.  I know I can put something in my cran_comments,  but I would rather submit with no Notes.  Any suggestions for a fix that I can take?

Thanks,

The server reported a permament move to the other URL given above, hence 
you simply need a trailinmg slash.

Hi Duncan,

That seems a reasonable scenario.

Right now, the interpretation, without further clarification from CRAN, would be, it is ok for a package to be on CRAN with license based usage restrictions included (e.g. for non-commercial use), but a package on CRAN, irrespective of it's own license, cannot "interact" with other packages that do have restrictions...which seems inconsistent.

Back to the original question by Kevin, this would now seem to be even more confusing...

Kevin, you may need to send an e-mail to CRAN-submissions at R-project.org <mailto:CRAN-submissions at R-project.org> on the issue with your package, to get clarification on the current policy and recommendations for resolution. You might even want to include this thread (but don't cc: this list), so that they are aware, if not already, of the issues raised here.

If you do, please post back with an update.

Regards,

Marc

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] RMarkdown vignettes with Wikiversity?
Message-ID: <d25f0b94-e1ec-7d84-1a20-f4d35ef36cbd@effectivedefense.org>

Hello, All:


	  Two questions:


		    1.  Might anyone have any thoughts on posting an RMarkdown 
vignette like an appendix to an article on Wikiversity?


		    2.  In particular, might it be feasible to post a link to an 
online RStudio instance that could be provided with the RMarkdown source 
for a vignette that's posted to Wikiversity?


	  I've written Wikiversity articles for which the detailed statistical 
analysis is currently in vignettes in the Ecfun package.  However, that 
seems somewhat inconsistent with my understanding of the purpose of 
vignettes, and posting such directly like an appendix with the companion 
Wikiversity article seems to make more sense, anyway.


	  For comments about this by a Wikiversity "Bureaucrat", who is also a 
Professor of Computer Information Systems at Harper College in Palatine, 
Illinois, see:

Hi All,

Just a quick note to indicate that one of the two Windows binaries for the package appeared overnight (EDT). Not sure if this experience is representative for others, or just a temporary bump in the road.

Hi all,

My two cents are below Marc's summary here:

It depends a bit what is meant by "interact". Years ago `spatstat` used
`gpclib` with a non-commercial license to do polygonal operations. The
solution was to list `gpclib` in `Suggests` and require the user to
make an active choice to use this piece of software with a warning
about non-commercial use. I find this to be an OK solution in lack of
completely free alternatives. These days `gpclib` is still on CRAN and
only has reverse `Suggests` and `Enhances`, so that seems fairly
consistent.

In the long run this was unsatisfatory and our specific problem was
solved by Adrian Baddeley by making the `polyclip` package.

Kind regards,
Ege

Windows binaries may be delayed these days, but they are generated in a 
bunch R-flavour-wise. They typical delay after a source package 
publication should be less then 72 hours ideally.

I do not want to make many general comments about licenses in public, as 
this is a very difficult matter and I am not a lawyer.

But let me cite from the CRAN policies:

"Packages with licenses not listed at 
https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/share/licenses/license.db will 
generally not be accepted. "

Further, I see in the discussions that you talked about depending on a 
software with a non-FOSS license. The CRAN team's point of view, for 
short, is:
A package with a FOSS license cannot strictly depend on a 
package/software that is non-FOSS. Obviously, the FOSS package cannot be 
used under its own license conditions in that case.

Best,
Uwe Ligges

Hi Ege,

The use of "Suggests" may be the relevant difference here. My use of the word "interact" was focused on the text in the CRAN policy that I quoted in my initial reply:

"Such packages are not permitted to require (e.g., by specifying in ?Depends?, ?Imports? or ?LinkingTo? fields) directly or indirectly a package or external software which restricts users or usage."

As Duncan noted in his reply, there may be time based differences that are relevant here, if the CRAN policy had changed at some point, and there was, in effect, a grand-fathering of older packages that perhaps would not be accepted today under the current policy.

Regards,

Marc

Hi Uwe,

Thanks for taking the time to reply.

Would you be willing to clarify/confirm the current situation regarding the hosting of non-FOSS packages on CRAN, such as those with ACM or Creative Commons license variants that have non-commercial use restrictions? 

These are presently included in the license.db file.

Are these on CRAN now because they are acceptable under the current policy, or are they on CRAN now, as Duncan posited, because they were acceptable under older policies and it would be disruptive to remove them now?

Thanks,

Marc

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Pre-test failure
Message-ID: <F45AF19F-9A85-4412-9313-440FCA0811E8@noaa.gov>

I test my packages very carefully before submission.  Earlier today I submitted a package that passed this morning on both winbuilder_release and winbuilder_devel.  The pre-test submission failed on rebuilding the vignette.  I just tried again on winbuilder_release and winbuilder_devel,  no problems.  There are no problems either on my Mac or a Fedora image. Moreover I tested the specific lines that were flagged,  and they work fine

So my questions are:

1.  Should I just resubmit assuming it was some kind of quirk?

2. Do I need to bump up the version to resubmit?

Thanks,

-Roy

    Can you share the links to the CRAN pre-test logs? Someone here 
might be able to guess what went wrong ...

    (FWIW I always *think* I'm testing very carefully, and I almost 
always get something wrong ...)

My personal opinion is that as long as a package doesn't actually make it on to CRAN, you don't need to bump the version. It's worked so far....

https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/plotdap_0.0.8_20201023_155845/Windows/00check.log

my problem is I don't have Windows myself.  So I assume if I can pass both winbuilders I should be good.  Here is the link to winbuilder_release I just ran:

https://win-builder.r-project.org/exQtKk9TKIeP

As you can see,  that is ok and rebuilt the vignette just fine.  

Thanks,

-Roy

Just out of curiousity,  how is pretest order determined?  I have a package that was submitted yesterday that is still waiting pretest,  while one I submitted today was just pretested.   Both are just bug fixes of existing packages,  not new packages. 

Thanks for the info and the work on CRAN,  Having to deal recently with package hell in Python, I appreciate these efforts.

I've made an example at https://github.com/tjtnew/newbies that uses
GitHub actions to monitor how many hours a package has been in the
"newbies" queue.  It updates hourly and saves to a csv in the repo.
It's not something I have time to develop more but if someone wants to
pick it up and take it further please do. Disclaimer - hacked together
quite quickly so code could well be a little iffy.

Generally by submission time, but there is a series of packages 
unprocessed stuck in the queue, will clear that up shortly.

Thanks.  I had a feeling that was the case from looking at the queue.  Does the clearing make them run or do they need to be resubmitted?

Message-ID: <CAOO9MKXrZt=5cdGRODcJF6OsB83AB3Qw1u5seraPbdohh5Qfcg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear community,

I am getting an error on CRAN on r-devel-linux-x86_64-debian-clang machine only:

  S3 method lookup found 'as.x.y' on search path

I know how to fix the error. I am interested to know how to reproduce
this error locally. I tried combination of
R_S3_METHOD_LOOKUP_BASEENV_AFTER_GLOBALENV_
and
_R_S3_METHOD_LOOKUP_REPORT_SEARCH_PATH_USES_
but didn't manage to reproduce the error.

What is the proper way to set up checks to detect these kinds of issues?

Moreover, I kindly request to provide "details" for other CRAN
machines in flavors page:
https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_flavors.html
"Details" are currently provided only for 3 machines there. Having
"details" for r-devel-linux-x86_64-debian-clang would probably answer
my question without involving readers of this mailing list.

Best Regards,
Jan Gorecki

not

Message-ID: <4fdb5faa-d2f6-c6b3-e90d-00fe424ba572@bebac.at>

Dear all,

we faced a warning on r-oldrel-macos-x86_64:
https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_PowerTOST.html
I'm not concerned about "Pandoc (>= 1.12.3) and/or pandoc-citeproc not 
available" in the first 5 vignettes since there were no problem in the 
previous releases.
However I found this on stackoverflow:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50789125/how-to-get-an-rmarkdown-vignette-for-r-package-to-escape-cran-warnings-on-solari
RolandAsc commented:
"In my understanding you can only see this warning if there is an error 
(either because warnings are being converted to errors or because there 
is another subsequent error), else it just doesn't come through. This is 
not an answer but maybe an explanation."
Seems to be correct. In my code a data.frame is assigned with a column 
"foo" and _without_ stringsAsFactors = FALSE. Later a function is called 
which requires "foo" as character.
The default stringsAsFactors was changed to FALSE in R4.0.0. Hence, my 
question: How "old" is the old releaseon CRAN's test machines/ macos? 
oldrel on windows is OK.

What shall we do?
Re-submit with the same release-number(either add stringsAsFactors = 
FALSE or call the function with as.character("foo")with an explanation?

Thanks Hugh,
I must have dropped it when pasting to email. I checked again and it
doesn't make any difference. So my question is still valid then.

If you click on WARN in the table on your check results page (i.e. if
you go to <https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/R.check/r-oldrel-macos-x86_64/PowerTOST-00check.html>
) you will see in the first line:

* using R version 3.6.2 (2019-12-12)

Hope that helps.

My 2 cents:
in the vignette, explicitely include stringsAsFactors=FALSE.
Yes, R 4 has that as the default, but I feel it will be years before >95% of users reading your vignette have R >4.
Anyone with an older version would not be able to directly copy the code.

As I said, just my thoughts.
Hoping not to provoke the discussion "but we need to encourage users to have a current R" as I did offline recently...

Regards,
Berry

Dear Helmut

I think the protocol is to always bump the version number for a 
re-submission even when the first one did not get onto CRAN.

By not specifying stringsAsFactors = FALSE, your vignette depends on R 
 >= 4.0.0, so you should

  - state that dependency in the DESCRIPTION file, or

  - test for it in the vignette, or

  - remove the dependency by being explicit about stringsAsFactors = FALSE.

Agree. But in this case it?s already on CRAN 
(https://cran.r-project.org/package=PowerTOST). Only this _one_ warning.
Shall I wait 28 days for a new submission with a new version number or 
try to re-submit with an explanation? For my taste a new version with 
only one line of code changed is a bit over the top.

You are right; maybe a lot of users are still behind R4.0.0. Though 
stringsAsFactors = FALSE is new default, I will add it for simplicity. 
Some call stating all defaults "good coding practice". ;-)

No, as Hong wrote two days ago here in another thread:

    My personal opinion is that as long as a package doesn't actually make it
    on to CRAN, you don't need to bump the version. It's worked so far....

which has worked me in exactly the same way.

Thanks to Kurt Hornik for confirming that following should be sufficient.
export _R_S3_METHOD_LOOKUP_BASEENV_AFTER_GLOBALENV_=false
export _R_S3_METHOD_LOOKUP_REPORT_SEARCH_PATH_USES_=true

I did more tests and found out that for the issue to manifest I had to
install xts, rather than just zoo (which registers generic method),
because a particular unit test required xts to be present.
Now I am able to reproduce the problem.

Message-ID: <4c9074ca-10a9-33c9-4c48-666dd6d2a546@bebac.at>

Dear all,

is there somewhere an official statement about the maximum run-times of 
examples in vignettes?

Currently I got for our seven vignettes on my six-years old machine 7.9 
minutes. One of them (containing a lot of simulation code) take 7.1 
minutes. Hence, in the submission we asked for --no-vignettes (on 
Windows only). Interestingly on some flavours and operating systems this 
was also observed, whereas on others not. What I don't understand: Some 
zip-files (e.g. Windows r-oldrel) which state in the result-Flag 
--no-vignettes contain not only the *.Rmd (what I would expect) but also 
the *.R and *.html.
Since a while we submit the time-critical vignette pre-compiled, which 
should bring the total execution time below one minute. Is that fine for 
all flavours & OSs?

Helmut

Seven minutes is excessive. I have (long) gone by the rule of "about one
minute" each for tests and examples. Rcpp is slightly above [1], especially
on Windows. I also tone down tests when on CRAN (using a scheme devised
almost a decade ago and described a few times here and in other places) where
to the package, having an extra fourth digit in the microrelease such as the
.4 currently in 1.0.5.4 signals 'full tests' whereas a three-digit release
number (such as 1.0.5 on CRAN signals reduced tests).  Works for me and on
all CI instances, requires no user input and no magic environment variable.

Now, we have some (partial) empirics on this as my reverse depends checks for Rcpp time
the runs (and the success/failure) in a small SQLite db (all on GH) [2]. I
also explicitly skip some packages taking too much time. I should probably
automate looking at the times and updating the list of skipped packages
automatically...

Dirk

[1] https://cloud.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_Rcpp.html

[2] This is from an machine that is loaded by the reverse depends running six
    tests in parallel over four cores. This would be quicker on a nicer machine
    but ... this what we have, and what we very much appreciate having access
    to. It is also 'total time' for 'R CMD check'.
    

    sqlite> select package, runtime/60 as timeInMins from results order by timeInMins desc limit 10;
    package     timeInMins      
    ----------  ----------------
    cbq         54.2629543542862
    rstanarm    51.9673245469729

    So the first four or five clearly are candidates for skipping.

Hi everyone,

I have created an R package which depends on a third party library. I need
to set an environment variable whose value will be the argument provided by
the user during the package installation. Is there any way I can set the
environment variable using autotools?

Thanks,

Sure. The one vignette contains simulation code which needs 1E5 to 1E6 
sims to get a stable result. Fewer sims are simply not meaningful.
Since we use a pre-complied vignette now the execution time is 
essentially zero.
The others take 45 seconds in total.
If we would pre-compile the second slowest as well, we would be down for 
the remaining four at 12 seconds.

> I have (long) gone by the rule of "about one minute" each for tests and examples.

OK. Do you know of any reference for this "rule"?

   My general solution is to run time-consuming computations in advance 
and store the results in (e.g.) inst/vignette_data, whence they can be 
retrieved via system.file("vignette_data", "output.rda", 
package="my_pkg"). (I might also include the R script required to 
generate the file so that I could automatically re-make those outputs as 
required ...)

My solution is similar to Ben's solution. Except that the code for creating
the data is in the vignette. The chunk only runs when the data is not
available. The trick is to pass code to the eval argument instead of a
fixed TRUE or FALSE. See
https://github.com/ropensci/git2rdata/blob/bad8a4cf42049faa72a04b202c5a4dfc233b4046/vignettes/efficiency.Rmd#L293
for an example.

Hi All:

A few days ago I put on CRAN a new version of a package.  Since then it has thrown some errors,  all do to the fact that sometimes on CRAN the rebuild of the Vignette fails. I received a notice about this from CRAN.  Now however,  when I test on winbuilder,  I get a Note because of the last time since a re-submissio.  Should I just submit the new version and not worry about the note?

Thanks,

Hi Roy,

 From my experience yours is not an uncommon situation so, yes, you 
should submit the new version and explain why you are submitting so soon 
after your last submission (to fix errors).

Best,

Hello,
I'm attempting to upload a package to CRAN and although it passes the R CMD
checks that I run, it doesn't pass the CRAN check and the response I get is
pasted below. I've looked online and found numerous solutions; some made no
sense to me & others didn't work.
I tried downloading and putting upquote.sty and inconsolata.sty files into
the latex folder. I also tried typing --no-manual in the project options
under R CMD check options.
Still the CRAN submission email response provided the below error.
What can I do to make this go away and have my package accepted?
It probably doesn't help that I know next to nothing about LaTeX.
Incidentally I don't mind not having a pdf manual, so if there is a simple
way to avoid the check by requesting not to have one, that'll do.
Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

Kind Regards
Anthony

This seems to be  the code for "small latin capital fl". Such characters often occur when copying text from external programs 
(similar to the familiar problem with fancy quotes). If that is the case, Just changing the offending symbol to  the two letters 'f' and 'l' should suffice.

Hello,
I'm attempting to upload a package to CRAN and although it passes the R CMD checks that I run, it doesn't pass the CRAN check and the response I get is pasted below. I've looked online and found numerous solutions; some made no sense to me & others didn't work.
I tried downloading and putting upquote.sty and inconsolata.sty files into the latex folder. I also tried typing --no-manual in the project options under R CMD check options.
Still the CRAN submission email response provided the below error.
What can I do to make this go away and have my package accepted?
It probably doesn't help that I know next to nothing about LaTeX.
Incidentally I don't mind not having a pdf manual, so if there is a simple way to avoid the check by requesting not to have one, that'll do.
Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

Kind Regards
Anthony

Hi Anthony,

I stumbled with the same issue for a package I submitted recently, the
problem seems to be that LaTex doesn't know how to map this unicode
character to a typesetting.

My unicode character was \u2229 and I tried several ways to avoid this warning.
On the vignette built with knitr I declared the unicode character the
following way:
%\DeclareUnicodeCharacter{2229}{$\cap$}
On the man pages I had to use a bit of code to print the right symbol:
\ifelse{latex}{\out{$\cup$}}{\ifelse{html}{\out{&cup;}}{}}.}

This way it passes the CRAN checks on all the machines and I didn't
get any comment from the reviewer.
In your case a similar changing the symbol might work, if there isn't
any symbol you'll probably need to map the ligature in latex:
tex.stackexchange.com/a/230140/178206.
Not sure how to include that map with the package tho.

Hope this helps,

Llu?s

My CRAN package eha depends on the survival package, and that creates 
problems with innocent users: It is about the 'frailty' function 
(mainly). While (after 'library(eha)')

f1 <- coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ age + frailty(inst), data = lung)

produces what you would expect (a frailty survival analysis), the use of 
the coxreg function from eha

f2 <- coxreg(Surv(time, status) ~ age + frailty(inst), data = lung)

produces (almost) nonsense. That's because the survival::frailty 
function essentially returns its input and coxreg is happy with that, 
treats it as an ordinary numeric (or factor) covariate, and nonsense is 
produced, but some users think otherwise. (Maybe it would be better to 
introduce frailty in a separate argument?)

I want to prevent this to happen, but I do not understand how to do it 
in the best way. I tried to move survival from Depends: to Imports: and 
adding import(survival, except = c(frailty, cluster)) to NAMESPACE. This 
had the side effect that a user must qualify the Surv function by 
survival::Surv, not satisfactory (similarly for other popular functions 
in survival).

Another option I thought of was to define my own Surv function as
Surv <- survival::Surv in my package, but it doesn't feel right.
It seems to work, though.

As you may understand from this, I am not very familiar with these 
issues. I have used Depends: survival for a long time and been happy 
with that.

Any help on this is highly appreciated.

G?ran

Not really:

I don't know if you received any private replies, but I don't see any 
public ones.

It's not clear from your message what you would like to happen with 
expressions like

  f2 <- coxreg(Surv(time, status) ~ age + frailty(inst), data = lung)

For example, would you like to generate an error, because you don't 
support frailty in this context?  Could you clarify that?

Yes, this should generate an error. I think I have solved this problem 
by using importFrom(survival, ...), where I replace ... with all the 
functions I want from survival (not including frailty, cluster, ...)
and then export some of them. For now I have in NAMESPACE

importFrom(survival,Surv)
importFrom(survival,attrassign)
importFrom(survival,coxph)
importFrom(survival,strata)
importFrom(survival,untangle.specials)
...
export(Surv)
export(strata)

I also have to write documentation for Surv and strata.

Is this reasonable?

coxreg could search for frailty and issue a warning or error if found.  This
returns TRUE if frailty is used in the formula argument as a function but
not otherwise.  That would allow implementation of a nicer message than
if it were just reported as a missing function.

find_frailty <- function(e) {
    if (is.logical(e)) return(e)
    if (length(e) > 1) {
        if (identical(e[[1]], as.name("frailty"))) return(TRUE)
        for (i in 1:length(e)) if (isTRUE(Recall(e[[i]]))) return(TRUE)
    }
    FALSE
}
find_frailty(frailty ~ frailty)
## [1] FALSE
fo <- Surv(time, status) ~ age + frailty(inst)
find_frailty(fo)
## [1] TRUE

Thanks Gabor, I thought of checking for the use of the three coxph 
specials frailty, cluster, and tt in my functions coxreg, phreg, aftreg, 
tpchreg, gompreg, and weibreg. Your function would come in handy for this.

Dear R-Devs,

I was wondering if someone could please help me to with two errors when
submitting a package to CRAN.

1) At the DESCRIPTION file I added some DOI's with curled brackets "<>"
inside the "<>" (e.g. <doi:10.1175/1520-0469(1981)038<1179:TSLROA>2.0.CO;2>).
I tried URLencode() the string in R and copy/paste the output into
the DESCRIPTION file, like this:
<doi:10.1175/1520-0469(1981)038%3C1179:TSLROA%3E2.0.CO;2>. But when I load,
build, check, etc, and ?raytracing the DOI does not appear correctly.
Everything after the first "%" disappeared and obviously, the DOI doesn't
work anymore.


2) I have a CITATION file at the sub-directory ins. Its content is like
this:

citHeader("To cite raytracing in publications use one of below:")

citEntry(entry = "manual",
   title          = "Atmospheric Rossby waves identification and tracking
with a raytracing numerical model",
   author         = personList(c(person("Amanda", "Rehbein"),
                    person("Tercio", "Ambrizzi"),
                    person("Sergio", "Ibarra-Espinosa"),
                    person("Livia M. M.", "Dutra"))),
   year           = "2020",
   url            = "https://github.com/salvatirehbein/raytracing",

   textVersion  =
   paste0("Rehbein, A., Ambrizzi, T., Ibarra-Espinosa, S., Dutra, L. M. M.:
Atmospheric Rossby waves identification and tracking with a raytracing
numerical model ", packageVersion("raytracing"), ".
https://github.com/salvatirehbein/raytracing, 2020.")
)

It passes all checks and gives a-okay citation when I type
citation("raytracing"). However, it fails in the CRAN tests with the
following error message.

Reading CITATION file fails with
     there is no package called 'raytracing'
   when package is not installed.

I will be very thankful for any help with this! Best,
Amanda

No need to reinvent the wheel. G?ran, you already use the "specials"
feature of terms.formula to find strata():

I think you can do the same for frailty(), for example:

> formula <- Surv(time, status) ~ age + frailty(inst)
> 
> Terms <- terms(formula, specials = "frailty")
> frailties <- attr(Terms, "specials")$frailty

Best regards,

Hello,

1) I found (via GitHub search for DOIs in DESCRIPTION files?https://github.com/search?q=org%3Acran+%3Cdoi+user%3Acran+filename%3ADESCRIPTION&type=Code&ref=advsearch&l=&l=) a package with an URL-encoded DOI see https://github.com/cran/clust.bin.pair/blob/e464ac7e5d094bffd25b7c4cbba67820b60f1cc1/DESCRIPTION and the resulting CRAN page https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/clust.bin.pair/index.html So I think you are right to use URL encoding.

I can reproduce the problem you get with the roxygen2-generated package-level manual page. The problem is that when going from Rd to HTML, the parts after "%" are ignored indeed. I'm not sure at what level this should be fixed. I opened an issue in roxygen2 https://github.com/r-lib/roxygen2/issues/1164 I hope others will have more useful answers. :-)

2) For that aspect I looked into a CITATION file I knew https://github.com/ropensci/bomrang/blob/master/inst/CITATION

For finding the version it uses meta$Version. So your CITATION could e.g. become

citHeader("To cite raytracing in publications use at least the first, if not both:")

year <- sub("-.*", "", meta$Date)
note <- sprintf("R package version %s", meta$Version)

citEntry(entry = "manual",
?? title????????? = "raytracing: An R package for identification and tracking the atmospheric Rossby waves",
?? author???????? = personList(c(person("Amanda", "Rehbein"),
??????????????????? person("Tercio", "Ambrizzi"),
??????????????????? person("Sergio", "Ibarra-Espinosa"),
??????????????????? person("Livia M. M.", "Dutra"))),
?? year?????????? = year,
?? url??????????? = "https://github.com/salvatirehbein/raytracing",
?? note????????? = note,
?? textVersion? =
?? paste0("Rehbein, A., Ambrizzi, T., Ibarra-Espinosa, S., Dutra, L. M. M.: Rossby Wave Ray Tracing v", meta$Version, ". https://github.com/salvatirehbein/raytracing, ", year,".")
)

citation(auto = meta)

citFooter("Thanks")

Ma?lle.

)

It passes all checks and gives a-okay citation when I type
citation("raytracing"). However, it fails in the CRAN tests with the
following error message.

Reading CITATION file fails with
? ? there is no package called 'raytracing'
? when package is not installed.

I will be very thankful for any help with this! Best,
Amanda

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Error during automatic check for vignette re-building
 - The magick package is required to crop
Message-ID: <YTBPR01MB30702D1254E7EF814054D56ECCEE0@YTBPR01MB3070.CANPRD01.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Dear all,

Currently I am trying to update my package (GALLO) with some small edits in the code. However, the package is not passing in the automatic check. I am getting only two warnings:

The first one is a warning related with the maintainer email (my email in the case), which is correct. I really think that this is not the cause of the package failure during the automatic checking.

The second warning is a problem during the vignette rebuilding. The warning is "The magick package is required to crop". In my first submission I didn't experience this error. In the recent submissions for updates, I included the magick package as a dependency of the package. However, this didn't fixed the issue. Additionally, I can't reproduce the errors in my machines, even when running R CMD check --as-cran. The error seems to be related with the lines 465-495 from the vignette. I double checked the code and introduced some small changes (such as reducing the figure dimensions).

Have ever someone faced a similar issue? However, it seems ineffective. Is there any possibility to be a false negative?

I am sending bellow the links for the check logs.

package GALLO_1.0.tar.gz does not pass the incoming checks automatically, please see the following pre-tests:
Windows: <https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/GALLO_1.0_20201105_154946/Windows/00check.log>

The first one is actually about your version number:  you called it 
version 1.0, but CRAN already has 1.0.  You need to increase the number.

I am not sure about this one; I'd need to look at the package to check.

Dear Duncan Murdoch,

Thank you for the quickly reply. Yes, the package is on Github. Any comment or suggestion will be very welcome.

Hi Pablo,

"The magick package is required to crop"  is related to using
BiocStyle for your vignette. Not sure what causes it, but I reported
this error some time ago:
https://github.com/Bioconductor/BiocStyle/issues/77.
On related issues and on bioc-devel mailing list
(https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/bioc-devel/2020-April/016656.html) it
is mentioned to use knitr::opts_chunk$set(crop = NULL) to solve it.
If the package is intended for CRAN I would recommend not using
BiocStyle template, which would also solve this.

Best,

Llu?s

Dear Llu?s Revilla,

Thank you very much for the comments and suggestions. I changed the vignette format from the BiocStyle to a regular html. However, I am still getting an error.  Now, the error is "Input vector too short" and it is related with the same code chunk lines 465-506.

I can't figure out a possible reason for this issue. Any comment or suggestion will be very welcome.

Kind regards.

Dear Pablo,

Sometimes when building a vignette the lines reported are a bit off (I
usually check the code above and below those lines).
I could reproduce the error on R 4.0.1, the error is triggered on
lines 515-519 on the following code:

relationship_plot(qtl_file=out.qtls.filtered, x="Abbrev", y="Ref_ID",
cex=1,gap=2.5,degree = 60,
canvas.xlim = c(-5, 5),
canvas.ylim = c(-3, 3),
grid.col = color.grid)

Hope you can solve it.

Cheers,

Llu?s

Message-ID: <CAJ=u__O2KZ0iajdn4CO2m6MdhAe9pG9m-LJQkpwuDAMiZpaN-w@mail.gmail.com>

Hey everyone,

I have created a package rminizinc
<https://github.com/acharaakshit/RMiniZinc> that depends on a third party
C++ API
which is used in some of the Rcpp files. The third party header files need
to be present for their compilation or the package doesn't install.

I wish to submit the package to CRAN but the CRAN servers will not have
the third party library. Is there any way I can install the package without
having the third party library on my system?

Thanks,
Akshit Achara

Hello,

I got an e-mail response with warnings on an R package submitted to CRAN.  So I made some changes to the package, after testing successfully with R CMD check -as-cran, then used r-hub for testing. On one of the systems, there were error/warnings on vignettes:

Could somebody please help?

Message-ID: <4e8f1ec8-d3a6-abb2-f81c-d33f8a708738@gmail.com>

Hi,

I am trying to figure out how to fix warnings from two of the CRAN 
machines on the submission of an update to a package. The only change to 
my package was to add a "show" method to one of the S4 classes, which 
was requested by a reviewer of the paper we submitted. The inability to 
get this updated package into CRAN? is the only thing holding up the 
revision (and probable acceptance) of the manuscript.

The same "warnings"s were found in the previous version. The package is 
called Mercator, and the CRAN check results from the? last version are here:
 ? https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_Mercator.html

I get warnings from the two fedora machine instances (clang and gcc). 
They both report

> Check: whether package can be  installed.
> Result: WARN
>? ?? Found the following significant  warnings:
>? ?? Warning: namespace ?flexmix? is  not available and has been replaced
 >
 > Check: data for non-ASCII characters
> Result: WARN
>? ??? Warning: namespace 'flexmix'  is not available and has been replaced
>? ??? by .GlobalEnv when processing  object '<unknown>'

The relationships in the DESCRIPTION files are:

1. Mercator depends on Thresher
2. Thresher imports moVMF
3. moMVF suggests flexmix

On my Windows machine, the package builds and installs with no errors or 
warnings even if flexmix is not available (which I believe to be the 
correct behavior). On R-Forge, both the Windows and LINUX versions build 
and install with no errors or warnings. On R-Hub, tested on multiple 
LINUX versions, the package builds and installs with no errors or warnings.

And flexmix is still clearly available from CRAN:
 ? https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/flexmix/index.html

In the latest attempt to get things to work, I added
 ? Suggests: flexmix
into the DESCRIPTION file for Mercator, but this didn't help fix the 
problem on CRAN.

Is there anything I can do to fix this problem (other than moan here on 
this list and hope that CRAN can just install flexmix on those machines)?

Thanks in advance for your help,
 ? Kevin

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Function editGrob not found unless grid is in Depends
Message-ID: <PR3PR06MB7115E372412AA1AB4D11DAC5CCE80@PR3PR06MB7115.eurprd06.prod.outlook.com>

Dear all,

I have recently been trying to write a plotting function where a external PNG file is drawn onto a ggmap object.

I managed to achieve this by using ggmap::inset , inputting as a grob the result of applying grid::rasterGrob to the image rotated with magick::image_rotate .

I therefore added ggmap, ggplot2, grid and magick to Imports in DESCRIPTION, and added the corresponding imports in NAMESPACE

However, when running R CMD check, I got an error saying 'could not find function editGrob', when running the example code for the mentioned plotting function.
I confirmed the error also happens if I install and load the package in a fresh R session.

If I then load explicitly grid through library(grid), the error disappears.

I tried to add explicitly importFrom("grid", editGrob) to NAMESPACE, but that made no difference.

I have only been able to solve the problem by adding "grid" to Depends in DESCRIPTION instead of Imports.

The code for the problematic plotting function can be found at https://github.com/Rafael-Ayala/openSkies/blob/main/R/openSkies_plottingFunctions.R (lines 61 to 91)

I would greatly appreciate if anybody could clarify why "grid" needs to be added to Depends in this case, and why not even adding NAMESPACE importFrom("grid", editGrob) fixes the problem if "grid" is left in Imports!

Thanks a lot in advance

Best wishes,

Rafa

You have to suggest flexmix.

Uwe suggested you suggest flexmix, but I see below you already tried that.

I'd like to take a look, but I can't find your package.  The existing 
version on CRAN gives the URL as http://oompa.r-forge.r-project.org/, 
but I can't see it mentioned there.

Hi Uwe,

Thanks for the suggestion. I thought of that idea last night, and tried 
it with the latest submission of version 0.11.4 of Mercator. That 
version is still in the submission queue waiting for manual inspection, 
but it gave the same error message. (See 
https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/Mercator_0.11.4_20201111_014655/Debian/00check.log)

I think I may try to "Import" or "Depend" on flexmix to force it to be 
available.

Is there some reason why my program should even need to know that 
flexmix is suggested several layers down the dependency hierarchy? For 
building and installing the package (or running R CMD check ---as-cran), 
I tried on my machine when flexmix is not even installed, and got no 
errors or warnings.

There is clearly something I don't understand about namespaces, and I'd 
like to learn it to avoid this kind of situation in the future.

Best,
 ? Kevin

Next guess is that you need more, because you may have an object that 
needs the flexmix, so likely something S4 related? I can take a closer look.

Hi Duncan,

Oops; I didn't realize I had forgotten to push updates to the OOMPA web 
site.

The code for Mercator is contained as part of the Thresher project in 
the subversion repository on R-Forge. 
(https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/thresher/) It's under 
pkg/Mercator below that URL

Thanks,
 ? Kevin

Okay, I've tried testing on my Mac with R 4.0.3 and R-devel for the new 
one, 4.0.3 for the CRAN version.

I'm not seeing any check error with the CRAN version.  I get an error 
trying to check 0.11.4 from R-forge because I don't have flexmix 
installed.  If I take flexmix out of the Suggests list, it checks with 
no error on 4.0.3, but I get the error you saw on R-devel when checked 
with --as-cran.

I tried debugging this, and narrowed it down a bit.  It happens when 
your package is installed, in particular in the do_install_source() 
function in src/library/tools/R/install.R.  But that function runs a new 
R instance, and I didn't get to debugging that.  I'll try again later 
today if nobody else figures it out.

HI Uwe,

That might be the key observation. The change to Mercator in this 
package was to add a "show" method to an S4 class. In its NAMESPACE, the 
flexmix package also exports a "show" method.

Both "flexmix" and "Mercator" have an
 ? import("methods")
directive in their NAMESPACE files, which is where the base method for 
"show" comes from. Also, if you just type show at the command prompt to 
see the definition, you get the parenthetical note that
"(This generic function excludes non-simple inheritance' see ?setIs.)"
I don't completely understand what this parenthetical remark? means, but 
I have a suspicion that it is highly relevant to my problem.

If I run
 ? library("Mercator")
 ? showMethods("show")
on a system where flexmix is installed, then the "show" method for 
flexmix (and related objects) is listed, because the flexmix NAMESPACE 
has been attached. If I run the same code on an R system where flexmix 
is not installed, then, of course, neither the NAMESPACE nor the method 
is available.

I suspect (but am by no means certain) that the combination of that 
parenthetical remark above and the existence of the "show" method in the 
suggested package is why I am getting errors on some systems.

But I don't really understand why. My package doesn't need the flexmix 
version of show. And (as Uwe said in an earlier comment), I thought that 
"Suggests" isn't supposed to be inherited. I don't want the flexmix 
NAMESPACE attached, since nothing in my package nor in the packages I 
directly want (Thresher by "Depends" and then moVMF by "Imports") 
actually requires it.

Why does the flexmix NAMESPACE get attached if some other package down 
the line merely suggests it? Is that supposed to happen? To me, it feels 
like a bug in the sense that it surprises the user (i.e., the package 
developer). And I guess is potentially a bug for the ultimate user of 
the package, since it adds a NAMESPACE that was not specifically 
requested by the top level package being loaded.

In any event, what's the best advice now on how to proceed?

Thanks again,
 ? Kevin

Hi Duncan,

I just sent a longer version of this message, but it looks to me like 
the underlying issue is the fact that flexmix and Mercator both define 
and export "show" methods for their S4 classes.? What confuses me is why 
the NAMESPACE of a package that is merely Suggest'ed by something 
several layers down the hierarchy should get attached and cause an issue 
like this one. (The attached NAMESPACE happens in current versions of R.)

Thanks,
 ? Kevin

Oh, I forgot to mention explicitly that checking (with --as-cran) on the 
development version of R on Windows also produces no errors or warnings.

Here's what I think is happening.

In the movMF:::.onLoad function there's a test whether flexmix is 
installed.  If found, then it is loaded and some methods are set.  (I'm 
not sure what caused flexmix to be installed:  I didn't intentionally 
install it, but it ended up in there when I installed enough stuff to 
check Mercator.)

In the R-devel --as-cran checks, some checks are run with only strong 
dependencies of your package visible.  Somehow I think that .onLoad 
function sees flexmix and loads it, but then some other part of the 
check can't see it.

A workaround is to add flexmix to your Imports clause.  This is a strong 
enough dependency to make it visible, and the error goes away.

HOWEVER, to me this is pretty clearly an R-devel bug:  you have no 
control over methods set by packages that you don't even use, so you 
shouldn't have to change your dependency lists if one of them sets a 
method that you're using.

Hi Duncan,

Thanks for the help. For now (since I want my package to get into CRAN 
so I can resubmit my paper), I'll add the "Import" clause, and write 
myself a note to try removing it later.

Best,
 ? Kevin

This seems more like a problem with the CRAN test machine, with the movMF package installed with flexmix available but loaded with flexmix not available, maybe interacting with a caching mechanism used by the methods package to avoid re-computing methods tables? Otherwise how would movMF ever know to create the flexmix class / method?

It seems like this could cause problems for the user if they installed movMV with flexmix available, but removed flexmix. This seems like a subtler variation of 'I installed package A but then removed dependency B and now A doesn't work', which could be a bug in R's remove.packages() but....

I tried to emulate the scenario of installing movMF and then removing flexmix in an interactive session, and then looking for the warning reported below. I was not successful, but the build report with the error is no longer available so I don't know what I'm looking for...

    Here's what I think is happening.

    In the movMF:::.onLoad function there's a test whether flexmix is 
    installed.  If found, then it is loaded and some methods are set.  (I'm 
    not sure what caused flexmix to be installed:  I didn't intentionally 
    install it, but it ended up in there when I installed enough stuff to 
    check Mercator.)

    In the R-devel --as-cran checks, some checks are run with only strong 
    dependencies of your package visible.  Somehow I think that .onLoad 
    function sees flexmix and loads it, but then some other part of the 
    check can't see it.

    A workaround is to add flexmix to your Imports clause.  This is a strong 
    enough dependency to make it visible, and the error goes away.

    HOWEVER, to me this is pretty clearly an R-devel bug:  you have no 
    control over methods set by packages that you don't even use, so you 
    shouldn't have to change your dependency lists if one of them sets a 
    method that you're using.

Hi Martin,

I think you may be right that it is something odd about the 
configuration on the test machine, since I haven't been able to 
reproduce it anywhere else. But Duncan did say he could reproduce it in 
R-devel but not R-4.0.3, so there's that.

The error message is buried deep in this thread, but it was:

Check: whether package can be installed.
Result: WARN
 ??? Found the following significant? warnings:
 ??? Warning: namespace ?flexmix? is? not available and has been replaced

Check: data for non-ASCII characters
Result: WARN
 ??? Warning: namespace 'flexmix'? is not available and has been replaced
 ??? by .GlobalEnv when processing? object '<unknown>'

Best,
 ? Kevin

Actually I think it is a bug in the check code.  I've just posted about 
this on the R-devel list.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Import package countreg that is not on CRAN
Message-ID: <CAA6Shk-acK8wgv2pATykvvbyn6jt7xLUktYY_0_LtQb_GpuwNg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm submitting a new package (https://github.com/Penncil/pda/) to CRAN. It
relies on some function (zerotrunc and hurdle in R/ODAP.R) from countreg (
https://rdrr.io/rforge/countreg/) , which is not on CRAN. The submission
returns error as below

https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/pda_1.0_20201113_083442/Debian/00check.log

Seems the r-forge repo is identified in the DESCRIPTION
Additional_repositories, but countreg is still not available. I assume this
is not a rare problem but didn't find useful solutions online. Any
suggestions? Thanks!

Best,
Chongliang

You cannot use strong dependencies to packages that are not in standard 
repositories such as CRAN or BioC.

If countreg is not in one of the mainstream repositories (CRAN or 
Bioconductor), then it may not have been subject to careful testing, so 
CRAN sees it as unreliable.  Since your package depends on it, yours is 
also unreliable, so CRAN won't publish it.

I don't know anything about the pda or countreg packages, so this is 
general advice on what you could do, and may not be applicable here:

   - you could take over maintenance of countreg (if its current 
maintainer agrees), and put in the work to get it on CRAN.
   - you could copy parts of countreg to your own package (if its 
license allows that), and drop your dependence on it.
   - you could substitute some other CRAN package that provides 
equivalent functionality and depend on that instead.
   - you could drop the parts of your package that need countreg, and 
submit a smaller package to CRAN without that dependency.
   - you could publicize that your package is on Github, and give up on 
publishing it on CRAN.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Error in loadNamespace(x) : there is no package
 called 'formatR'
Message-ID: <04de00c7-78fc-16d3-05fd-92e6e9030062@IEEE.org>

Dear r-package-devel,

The rEDM package is failing the automated check, as noted here:

https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/rEDM_1.7.0_20201113_131811/Windows/00check.log

When running rhub::check_for_cran(), disk file errors were reported.

The automated check seems to be failing with:

Error in loadNamespace(x) : there is no package called 'formatR'

This package does not explicitly use formatR:

Imports: methods, Rcpp (>= 1.0.1)
LinkingTo: Rcpp, RcppThread
Suggests: knitr, rmarkdown
VignetteBuilder: knitr

Could it be these errors (disk full, no formatR) are related?? If not, 
does formatR need to be listed as a dependency?

If the former (R server config/resource build errors), do I need to 
resubmit the package?

Thank you.

J Park

I think you need to Suggest the formatR package, because your
vignettes use it. From 'Writing R extensions':

"Many packages using knitr also need the package formatR which it
suggests and so the user package needs to do so too and include this
in ?VignetteBuilder?."

You can change your package from using:

  Imports: countreg

to use:

  Suggests: countreg

For this to work, you'll have to update your code, package tests,
examples, and vignettes, to run conditionally on 'countreg' being
installed, e.g.

if (requireNamespace("countreg", quietly = TRUE)) {
  ...
}

Whether or not this makes sense depends on how central 'countreg' is
to your package.  If it is only needed optionally and for a small part
of your functionality, then it's doable but if it's a mission-critical
dependency, it might be too much of a hack.

This is in compliance with CRAN and in agreement with what Uwe says too.

I've used this myself in for instance
https://cran.r-project.org/web/package=aroma.core where small parts of
the functionality depend on packages not in the mainstream (= CRAN &
Bioconductor) repositories. This allows those who wish to use
alternative methods, if they want to go the extra mile to install
them.  Also, if they're popular enough it might nudge the maintainers
of those enough to submit to CRAN or Bioconductor - a process that
might take years, if at all.

Ah, yes... I see it now in Writing R Extensions.? Apologies for the 
oversight.

Regarding rmarkdown, is it redundant to include rmarkdown in 
VignetteBuilder if it is in Suggests, or is perhaps needed in the build 
config as a separate entity?

e.g:

Suggests: knitr, rmarkdown
VignetteBuilder: knitr, formatR

or

Suggests: knitr, rmarkdown
VignetteBuilder: knitr, rmarkdown, formatR

Thank you.

"Note that if, for example, a vignette has engine ?knitr::rmarkdown?,
then knitr provides the engine but both knitr and rmarkdown are needed
for using it, so both these packages need to be in the
?VignetteBuilder? field and at least suggested (as rmarkdown is only
suggested by knitr, and hence not available automatically along with
it). Many packages using knitr also need the package formatR which it
suggests and so the user package needs to do so too and include this

So I think you need

Suggests: knitr, rmarkdown, formatR
VignetteBuilder: knitr, rmarkdown, formatR

I'm quite sure you want to use the following:

Suggests: knitr, rmarkdown, formatR
VignetteBuilder: knitr

Here are the details.  For the 'VignetteBuilder' field, you want to
put all packages that provide the **vignette engines** you are using.
For example, if your package vignettes use either of

%\VignetteEngine{knitr::knitr}
%\VignetteEngine{knitr::rmarkdown}

your package is using a vignette engine from the 'knitr' package, so
you need to specify:

VignetteBuilder: knitr

Next, with 'knitr' listed in 'VignetteBuilder', you need to make sure
'knitr' is listed in either 'Depends' or 'Suggests' (or possibly
'Imports' - not sure).  If 'knitr' is only used for your vignettes, it
is sufficient to specify it under 'Suggests', which is also the most
common way to use it, i.e.

Suggests: knitr

The above settles the **vignette-engine package**.  Then your vignette
engine might depend on additional packages.  Your package needs to
depend on those too, typically also listed under 'Suggests'.  For
example, when you use %\VignetteEngine{knitr::rmarkdown}, that
vignette engine requires the 'rmarkdown' package (can be guessed from
them name but reading the docs is the only way to be sure - I think
there's work in 'tools' to improve on this).    So, this means you
need to use:

Suggests: knitr, rmarkdown

Finally, if your vignettes make use of additional, optional features
from other packages, you need to make sure your package depends on
those too.  Since you make use of 'formatR' features, you need to add
that to Suggests as well;

Suggests: knitr, rmarkdown, formatR

/Henrik

PS. Vignettes are a bit of special creatures. Their dependencies are
only needed during 'R CMD build' and 'R CMD check', which most
end-users never perform. I think it could be favorable if we could
declare vignette dependencies separate from install/run-time
dependencies, e.g.

VignetteBuilder: knitr
VignetteDepends: rmarkdown, formatR

It should make the above process a bit clearer.  It would also make it
clear to those who are only interested in viewing vignettes, but have
no interest in rebuilding vignettes, what packages they need to
install in order to access all of the package's functions.  Just an
idea.

So this means that WRE is wrong? It says:

"Note that if, for example, a vignette has engine ?knitr::rmarkdown?,
then knitr provides the engine but both knitr and rmarkdown are needed
for using it, so both these packages need to be in the
?VignetteBuilder? field and at least suggested (as rmarkdown is only
suggested by knitr, and hence not available automatically along with
it). Many packages using knitr also need the package formatR which it
suggests and so the user package needs to do so too and include this
in ?VignetteBuilder?."

My understanding is that R CMD build (and possibly other
commands/functions as well) checks for the packages in
'VignetteBulider`, this is why you need to include rmarkdown and
formatR as well. See the source code in build.R and e.g.
https://bugs.r-project.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=15775 etc.

Things may have changed since Henrik and I wrote the code, but his 
description matches my understanding as well (and I think he's 
contributed more recently than I have).

The way non-Sweave vignettes work is that some packages register 
themselves to recognize vignette files in the vignettes directory.  The 
default one recognizes .Rnw files as vignettes (and a few other 
extensions too); the knitr::rmarkdown one recognizes .Rmd files and some 
others.  The only way for a package's registration code to be called is 
for it to be listed as a VignetteBuilder.  See ?tools::vignetteEngine 
for details of the engine.

The rmarkdown package doesn't register any vignette engines, so it 
doesn't need to be in VignetteBuilder.  Same for formatR.

It's fairly common to have a package only used in the vignette, so you 
list it in Suggests.  But that wouldn't apply only to rmarkdown and 
formatR, there are lots of other examples.  However, I'd guess it's 
pretty common to forget to include rmarkdown and formatR, since they may 
not be explicitly used.  Then putting them in the VignetteBuilder field 
will trigger an error if they are not also in Suggests.

Can one of you please fix WRE then? The part that says

"...then knitr provides the engine but both knitr and rmarkdown are
needed for using it, so both these packages need to be in the
?VignetteBuilder? field..."

Thanks a lot!

No, neither of us are members of R Core.  Only R Core can edit the manuals.

Write to CRAN at R-project.org, explain how to install the third party 
software (availability and names of Debian packages etc.) and the CRAN 
team will decide whether the software will be isntalled on (a subset of) 
CRAN machines.

I wrote a package that contains a graphical interface written with packages
"shiny" and "shinyjqui". My package can also be used from the CLI, so I
listed both "shiny" and "shinyjqui" as optional dependencies. I ran R CMD
check --as-cran on my computer in R 3.6.3 and devel, and both passed
without any errors or warnings. However, when I tried uploading the package
to CRAN, I got this error:

Error in loadNamespace(x) : there is no package called ?shiny?
Error: unable to load R code in package ?soundcorrs?
Execution halted
ERROR: lazy loading failed for package ?soundcorrs?

How can I fix this?

You probably import functions from shiny. Don't do that, refer to them
with the `::` operator instead.

This is actually what I do. Before you replied, I was told to write to CRAN
and explain, and they will decide whether the packages will be installed on
CRAN machines. Thank you for your help nonetheless.

No, I told you about a "third party C++ API" you asked for, not about an 
R package. R packages  from BioC + CRAN should be availabe on CRAN, in 
that case it is a problem in your package.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Publishing Java Wrappers The Right Way
Message-ID: <CAB-BFRrJ4H5_dpFsZNnH3YixEm-bK9_tNZL---br609ODzD00w@mail.gmail.com>

Hey Everyone,

I have an R-package that wraps some Java code.
The dependencies needed are around 10MB.

Thus I split the package into 2 packages. One providing only the
dependencies:

https://github.com/petermeissner/kafkaesquejars

... and one providing the actual code:

https://github.com/petermeissner/kafkaesque


I submitted the first package to CRAN and it came back stating that:
"Package has FOSS license, installs .class/.jar but has no 'java' directory.
"

Of course there is no java directory because the package does not contain
any code, just dependencies
and those are placed in ./inst/java.

Now what to do? In response I added  ./java/sources.md file and listed all
dependencies as well as URLs where
the source code of those dependencies can be downloaded.

Is this correct? Do I miss something else?


I really would appreciate some guidance on doing this right.

Best, Peter

I did briefly wonder why your reply to me cited an email from Akshit Achara
who asked about third party C++ API. I assumed it was because the solution
to his problem and mine was the same.

In the meantime, I got a reply from Kurt Hornik who said I have a top-level
call

soundcorrsGUI <- shiny::shinyApp (ui, server)
>

so what I should really do is to move "shiny" from "Suggests" to "Imports".
I don't want to do this, however, because the GUI is just an addition, the
package is perfectly usable without it. I wrapped "soundcorrsGUI" in a
function:

soundcorrsGUI <- function () {
>
> if (!requireNamespace("shiny",quietly=T) ||
> !requireNamespace("shinyjqui",quietly=T))
> stop ("\"soundcorrsGUI\" requires packages \"shiny\" and \"shinyjqui\".")
>
> shiny::shinyApp (ui, server)
>
> }
>

and this seems to solve the problem with "shiny", but now I have a problem
with "shinyjqui". I actually only need one function from it: in the call to
"shinyApp" above,

ui <- shiny::navbarPage ([?] ui.soundchanges [?])
>

where

ui.soundchanges <- shiny::fluidPage ([?]
> shinyjqui::sortableCheckboxGroupInput [?])
>

I tried wrapping "ui.soundchanges" in a function in the same way as I did
with "soundcorrsGUI" but this doesn't help.

Is there a way to make it work without turning "shiny" and "shinyjqui" into
obligatory dependencies?

Best wishes,
Kamil Stachowski

If you never call shinyjqui::sortableCheckboxGroupInput except in that 
one place, then you should put that call within the requireNamespace 
test.  Things I'd change there:

  - Do not use T, use TRUE.

  - Wrap *everything* that requires those packages in the 
requireNamespace test.

  - Make sure your example code in help pages never calls that function 
unless shiny and shinyjqui are present, by a test similar to the above 
but a positive one:

if (requireNamespace("shiny") && requireNamespace("shinyjqui")) {

    # example code

}

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Debugging library.dynam to include a manual shared
 object
Message-ID: <CAN5kahznUn1Dj_UfpUsH=voNkvptjUdDvbtEprHYRjD_WuCsJg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am trying to build an R package with a manually compiled .so file. To do
so, I have included a call to useDynLib() in my NAMESPACE file.

Building this works fine in RStudio with devtools::load_all('.'), but when
I try to run R CMD INSTALL, I get the error: package or namespace load
failed in library.dynam(lib, package, package.lib): shared object
'filename.so' not found.

Is there any way I can debug library.dynam to see where it's looking for my
.so and why it can't find it? Thanks for your help!

Best,
Jon

Dear Uwe,

Thanks for the suggestions, I was able to install my package without the
header files or library on the system.

Thanks,

I've (finaly) followed this thread to here  ((too many e-mails, too many ...)).

I think I have understood what you wrote and why R Core should
change WRE in this part.

Notably as I have not written it, there needs to be consultation
--> Forwarding to R-core  ((i.e., a very rare cross-post !))

Thank you, very much for the discussion, G?bor, Henrik and Duncan!

Message-ID: <8f84d204-35fe-ab0d-85e6-dbec11a02682@uni-wuerzburg.de>

Dear R developer list,
in general, if functionality from other packages are used in one's own 
package, it is of course the best way to declare the other package as an 
import. What is the straight forward way for only minor functions or 
functionality, especially when the other package comes with a lot 
dependencies itself? Is it advisable or ok to only use the according 
third party source code snippet and cite the other package (of course if 
the license of the package allows it; own package is AGPL, third package 
is GPL)? Or should the third party package always be installed as a 
dependency? I want to avoid bloating the installation process but it is 
very important for me not to violate academic standards, intellectual 
properties and best practise.

Thanks,
Wolfgang

In general you would not need to do that, or do that:

   .dll none of which you need to explicitly, a huge win for you)

fails you have a problem, no matter how helpful the optional tools are.

As said, R knows where to find a package's shared library file. For the rest,
it is (on Linux) ld.so and its documentation but you (as far as I can
remember) cannot set LD_LIBRARY_PATH from within a running R session.

It might help if you described your problem in more detail with a
reproducible example.

Note that the devtools equivalents of 'R CMD build/check/install' are devtools::build(), devtools::check(), devtools::install().
devtools::load_all() has a different purpose.

   I would recommend copying the snippet/minor function into your own
code, with attribution/citation (and, as a courtesy, e-mailing the
maintainer of the package to let them know).
   The only disadvantage I can think of in this approach is that you
won't automatically benefit from bug fixes or other improvements in
the upstream code.

 extension
Message-ID: <CAJbAZz4-0tuNcGh9LRGObU9uF+CDq2-81ZN5qe5RSrCDQtMiKA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, all. In re-submitting a package to CRAN, I'm getting the following
warnings in the Debian pre-test:

Found the following significant warnings:
  sort.cpp:12:28: warning: binary constants are a C++14 feature or GCC extension
  sort.cpp:12:43: warning: binary constants are a C++14 feature or GCC extension

I added some C++ code to speed up the package and the warnings refer to
this line of C++:

   while ((s[p + length] & 0b11000000) == 0b10000000) {

The line has to do with parsing UTF-8 strings by figuring out how many
bytes are used in each character. Is the 0b... notation not allowed in
CRAN? I could substitute decimal constants, but that will be a bit more
obtuse. The other platforms seems to allow this; only the Debian check
failed.

Dear Dan,

As the warning says, the binary notation you use is only valid with
C++14 and onwards. You can either add SystemRequirements: C++14 to
your DESCRIPTION file, or use decimal (or hex) notation.

In my opinion it's even better to name your constants to convey their
meaning to the reader of the code. Then it wouldn't be a big issue if
you use binary, decimal, or hex notation.

Best,
David

Message-ID: <CAJbAZz43-GXyep9fpQvJ0Q05FqocBKymayXE7EJo2454QPEQGw@mail.gmail.com>

I've run into another issue re-submitting my package to CRAN:

Flavor: r-devel-windows-ix86+x86_64
Check: package dependencies, Result: ERROR
  Package required but not available: 'stringi'

Everything seems to run fine on the other platformd and I used the stringi
package in the previous iteration of the package without issue, but it
seems perhaps there is some issue with stringi under Windows right now?

   My submission from auto-check, and I'm not sure why because Windows and Debian checks both list "OK" and there are no unresolved problems on the CRAN status ...

   My current guess is that the problem is with the too-long check time on Windows (NOTE: "Overall checktime 18 min > 10 min")

  I guess I have to get busy setting more tests and examples to skip-on-CRAN (kind of a pain as there's no low-hanging fruit - other than the 'testthat' tests, none of the individual test files take longer than 15sec, although this is doubled because they have to be run on 386 and x64 ...)

  An alternative is that this is a confusingly worded message indicating that there are strong rev dependencies so the package needs to be further checked? (That seems unlikely as it explicitly asks me to resubmit)

   Can anyone confirm/support those guesses?

   cheers

It's under your control. You can detect 'are we on Windows' and branch or, as
I do with test runner I use, exit_file("...") based on such conditions.

No. If there were any (even false positive ones) they'd be listed there.

Thanks Dirk. Yes, for lme4 the tests for each archiecture take longer 
than 5 min, so the overall check time exceeds 10 min.

So one can follow Dirk's advise.

As a general remark for others who will read this in the future:
tests should test the software, but it is generally not important to 
have real world examples. Small data and few iterations are typically 
sufficient for tests.
It is also possible to run less important tests only conditionally if 
some environment variable is set that you only define on your machine.

Best,
Uwe Ligges

No, it was being reinstalled while your package got checked. SO we havbe 
to trigger new checks (I hope we did so, but I cannot know as you do not 
mention the package name).

    Thanks all for the help.  The reward (as usual) is another dumb 
question.

If I add up the elapsed times listed in

https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/lme4_1.1-26_20201122_184744/Windows/examples_and_tests/examples_x64/lme4-Ex.timings

   I get 21.43 seconds.  But the output in

https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/lme4_1.1-26_20201122_184744/Windows/00check.log

says

** running examples for arch 'x64' ... [41s] OK

  The values for i386 have a similar discrepancy (20.6 vs 36s).  I can 
appreciate that would be a bit of overhead (and rounding error), but ... 
? (there are a total of 61 examples)

   I wouldn't normally worry about the discrepancy, but I'm doing my 
best to shave seconds where I can ...  can anyone see any obvious thinkos?

   I might as well add (in my partial defense, in response to Uwe's 
point about not needing real-world/big examples for tests); many of 
lme4's tests are regression tests of edge cases that came up in the real 
world with moderately sized data sets.  *In principle* it might be 
possible to find a way to reduce those medium-sized problems to small, 
fast problems that still demonstrated the same numerical problems, but 
it's hard and time-consuming (at least for me) ...

   cheers
     Ben Bolker

   And one more (last for a while): presumably there is no way to check 
CRAN windows timing without submitting to CRAN ... ?  (I will obviously 
do my best by doing arithmetic on the tests that I set to be skipped, 
but it would be nice to be able to double-check without wasting 
everyone's time ... I guess if I knew that CRAN submissions would 
*always automatically* be rejected with Windows test times>10 min, I 
could use CRAN submission itself as my test ... but maybe that's a bad 
idea?)

I have found win-builder timings come close,  but only close.  My experience is that the CRAN timings were uniformly slower than those on win-builder.  But I also find that I can get quite significant differences between win-builder-release and win-builder-devel.  So I also take the slowest that I can find as a basis,  and assume the actual times will be slower than that.

HTH,

So I also take the slowest that I can find as a basis,  and assume the actual times will be slower than that.

winbuilder and the WIndows check machione for the regul?ar checks are 
actually identical.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Failing vignette engine for package rasciidoc on
 solaris
Message-ID: <20201123120749.GA18150@h6.fooboz>

Dear List,
one of my packages, rasciidoc (a simple wrapper to 'knitr' and 'asciidoc'),
includes a minimal vigentte engine.
When submitting the package with a vignette using that engine, the vignette is
re-built on all platforms except for r-patched-solaris-x86:
https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_rasciidoc.html
https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/R.check/r-patched-solaris-x86/rasciidoc-00check.html

Maybe rasciidoc's vignette engine is somewhat superfluous, but since it works
for all platforms except solaris, I kind of would like to use it. 

I cannot reproduce the error using rhub:
  ## Test environments
  - R-hub solaris-x86-patched-ods (r-release)
  
  ## R CMD check results
  ? On solaris-x86-patched-ods (r-release)
    checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... WARNING

    rasciidoc 2.724  0.352   48.75
  
  0 errors ? | 1 warning ? | 2 notes ?


And I happen to have no solaris box at hand for testing. 
Does anybody have any suggestion on how I could tackle this?
Thanks and best regards,
Dominik

The error message says:   "Can't find program `source-highlight`. Please 
install first (http://www.gnu.org/software/src-highlite/)."  You have 
listed this in SystemRequirements as "recommended", but even if you had 
listed it as required, your build shouldn't fail if it is not found:  it 
should test for that program, and continue on if it is not there.  For 
example, it could output a vignette containing nothing except the 
warning message that source-highlight is needed to build the vignette. 
This is described in Section 1.6, "Writing portable packages", of 
Writing R Extensions.

I need to set up different compile flags for MacOS, Linux, and Windows. 
For Windows I can just use `Makevars.win` but I cannot figure out how to 
do the same for MacOS.

Dear Guido,
i wrote an Makevars.win <http://makevars.win/> and separately an Makevars file, in the Makevars file I set the following
PKG_LIBS = $(LAPACK_LIBS) $(BLAS_LIBS) $(FLIBS)
CXX_STD = CXX11

which works for me on MacOs well. Dont know if this answer helps you.

I have solved it for now using:

UNAME_S := $(shell uname -s)
ifeq ($(UNAME_S),Linux)
 ??? PKG_CPPFLAGS=...
 ??? PKG_LIBS=...
else
 ??? PKG_CPPFLAGS=...
 ??? PKG_LIBS=...
endif

But R CMD check now complains about GNU extensions.

I am not sure if you can solve this without a configure file, which
can be a simple shell script. Here is an example, that detects a bunch
of OSes and then creates an OS-dependent Makevars file:
https://github.com/r-lib/ps/blob/master/configure

You'll probably also need configure.win if you have configure, but it
can just call configure in this case:
https://github.com/r-lib/ps/blob/master/configure.win

Hi folks,


	  devtools::release() gave the following errors:


...
Ready to submit fda (5.1.7) to CRAN?
1: Not yet
2: Absolutely
3: Uhhhh... Maybe?

Selection: 2

2: In charToRaw(enc2utf8(val)) :

	  Jim Ramsay got this after setwd to what seemed to be the appropriate 
working directory and then running devtools::release(), as noted above. 
As near as both of us can determine, we've followed essentially the same 
protocol here as with other package submissions.


	  In case you want the entire devtools::release() transcript, it 
appears below running under Big Sur on a Mac.


	  Suggestions?
	  Thanks,
	  Spencer Graves & Jim Ramsay

Why not use the CRAN submission web page, as documented here: 
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html#Submission?

   Maybe off-topic, but I see that the tarball is 100+Mb ... won't that 
raise flags upon CRAN submission?  (The current CRAN tarball is <1 Mb ...)

 From the CRAN policies, there's no explicit limit given but ...

=====
Packages should be of the minimum necessary size. Reasonable compression 
should be used for data (not just .rda files) and PDF documentation: 
CRAN will if necessary pass the latter through qpdf.

As a general rule, neither data nor documentation should exceed 5MB 
(which covers several books). A CRAN package is not an appropriate way 
to distribute course notes, and authors will be asked to trim their 
documentation to a maximum of 5MB.

Where a large amount of data is required (even after compression), 
consideration should be given to a separate data-only package which can 
be updated only rarely (since older versions of packages are archived in 
perpetuity).

Similar considerations apply to other forms of ?data?, e.g., .jar files.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Rglpk on Linux
Message-ID: <07d42848-fb01-9033-1d18-2acb015d54d5@iqb.hu-berlin.de>

Dear R developer list,

I want to add 'Rglpk' as a dependency to a package. On windows and MacOS 
everything works fine, but there seem to be installation issues with the 
underlying optimization software 'GLPK' on Linux systems. The problem 
occurs when testing on Rhub and on Travis (I don't have a local Linux 
machine available):

https://builder.r-hub.io/status/eatATA_0.9.0.tar.gz-bbf79f5120bc435d89eb4ea3f5b62918

https://travis-ci.org/github/beckerbenj/eatATA/jobs/743971533

with the error message:

* installing *source* package ?Rglpk? ...

** package ?Rglpk? successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked

** using staged installation

** libs

/bin/bash: line 0: cd: GLPK: No such file or directory

Makevars:10: recipe for target 'GLPK.ts' failed

make: *** [GLPK.ts] Error 1

ERROR: compilation failed for package ?Rglpk?
I am aware that there are other/similar reports of Rglpk installation 
problems on Linux (e.g. 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25114771/glpk-no-such-file-or-directory-error-when-trying-to-install-r-package) 
But other reverse dependencies of Rglpk on CRAN do not appear to have 
these issues (e.g. mknapsack, MSCMT, npbr ...)? Thanks, Benjamin

Hi,

on R-hub's Linux builders it is automatically installed if needed,
except that it wasn't on Fedora, because of a bug. Please try again,
and if it does not work report an issue on R-hub.

On Travis, you'll need to install the required packages yourself in
the `.travis.yml` file.

On CRAN's machines it should be installed, so nothing to worry about there.

If you don't have a Linux machine, but you have a fairly recent macOS
or Windows computer, then you can run Linux in Docker. If you ever
need to debug issues on Linux.

Gabor

Make sure you have Ubuntu package

   libglpk-dev

installed (which can typically control at your CI level though not at
RHub). It will pull the runtime package libglpk40 in.

Or, better still, enable the Rutter PPAs, or the RSPM, for your CI runs
because then you can just install Rglpk premade.

I like bspm for this; below you can see the full command log just running
'install.packages("Rglpk")' on a bspm-enabled system backed by the PPA (and I
have written some more at my blog about all this, follow the URL below to
blog and scroll, or google-search). It also install package slam premade and
whatever is needed. (It's Docker demo, so once the install concludes it ends
the demo.)

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] submitting two packages simultaneously
Message-ID: <CACSk52_dR03kFC0z3jBtwgXbM=7EgpkVT+v3sCWo332MyOe2Nw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

I plan to submit a package I created called spNetwork. The package
uses both Rcpp and parallelization to ensure reasonable calculation
time. However, it is currently not possible to pass a compiled
function to a child process. The recommended workaround is to store
compiled functions in an existing package. So I put the worker
functions using Rcpp in a separate package called spNetworkCpp and
everything works like a charm (all tests and checks passed). To submit
spNetwork to CRAN, how should I proceed? Should I submit spNetworkCpp
first, then spNetwork?

Thank you in advance
All the best,

Jeremy Gelb

Probably I'm missing something, but why do you need the functions in a
separate package?

Yes, this is the way (pun intended).

Yes, that is the usual recommendation. Beats recompiling the function on each
worker node.

Sounds good to me. And if the former is a dependency of the later you need to
sequence it that way.

Unless maybe you would want to keep it simpler and keep everything in _one_
package so that the child processes would load the same package.  That way
you also avoid possible 'version skew' if the main packages and the client
package are not aligned.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] C++11 requirements for package dependencies
Message-ID: <330ba8bd-4013-1273-9ae4-92fa0482484d@ki.se>

[Apologies for cross-posting]

A colleague uses a package I maintain (rstpm2) as a dependency in their
package (rsimsum) with testing using GitHub Actions. They found that
testing failed against R versions 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5 because recent
versions of RcppArmadillo (which is a dependency in rstpm2) require
C++11. As a dependency diagram:

rsimsum --> rstpm2 --> RcppArmadillo

Should I update rstpm2 to include "CXX_STD = CXX11" in the Makevars and
Makevars.win files and add "SystemRequirements: C++11" to the
DESCRIPTION, or is there a simple way in GitHub Actions to use C++11 for
older versions of R?

Moreover, as a principle, should a package need to change the Makevars
and DESCRIPTION files to suit the most recent updates of their
dependencies? I would have thought that such a need would break many
packages.

Sincerely, Mark.

I think that C++11 isn't a requirement of RcppArmadillo, it's an option 
that is used if available.  (Assuming you are using the CRAN version, 
not an experimental/devel version.)  A user of the header file can include

#define ARMA_USE_CXX11

which would make it a system requirement of whatever package did that, 
even though it isn't a system requirement for RcppArmadillo.

But I could be wrong about this...

| package (rsimsum) with testing using GitHub Actions. They found that
| testing failed against R versions 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5 because recent
| versions of RcppArmadillo (which is a dependency in rstpm2) require
| C++11. As a dependency diagram:
| 
| rsimsum --> rstpm2 --> RcppArmadillo
| 
| Should I update rstpm2 to include "CXX_STD = CXX11" in the Makevars and
| Makevars.win files and add "SystemRequirements: C++11" to the
| DESCRIPTION, or is there a simple way in GitHub Actions to use C++11 for
| older versions of R?

Yes.  Writing R Extension has the goods, as usual:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.2.4 Using C++11 code
----------------------

R can be built without a C++ compiler although one is available (but not
necessarily installed) on all known R platforms.  As from R 4.0.0 a C++
compiler will be selected only if it conforms to the 2011 standard
('C++11').  A minor update(1) ('C++14') was published in December 2014.
A revision ('C++17') was published in December 2017, and a further
revision ('C++20', with many new features) is scheduled for publication
in May 2020.

   What standard a C++ compiler aims to support can be hard to
determine: the value(2) of '__cplusplus' may help but some compilers use
it to denote a standard which is partially supported and some the latest
standard which is (almost) fully supported.

   The webpage <http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/compiler_support> gives
some information on which compilers are known to support recent C++
features.  'g++' claims full C++11 support from version 4.8.1.

   As from version 3.6.2(3), R selects a default C++ compiler with
options that conform as far as possible(4) to C++11.  Packages which do
not specify 'R (>= 4.0)' in their 'DESCRIPTION' files need to explicitly
require C++11, hence the rest of this section.

   In order to specify C++11 code in a package to be used with R
versions from 3.1.0 but before 3.6.2, the package's 'Makevars' file (or
'Makevars.win' on Windows) should include the line

     CXX_STD = CXX11
Compilation and linking will then be done with the C++11 compiler (if
any).

   Packages without a 'src/Makevars' or 'src/Makefile' file may specify
that they require C++11 for code in the 'src' directory by including
'C++11' in the 'SystemRequirements' field of the 'DESCRIPTION' file,
e.g.

     SystemRequirements: C++11

   If a package does have a 'src/Makevars[.win]' file then setting the
make variable 'CXX_STD' is preferred, as it allows 'R CMD SHLIB' to work
correctly in the package's 'src' directory.

[... rest omitted ...]

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
| Moreover, as a principle, should a package need to change the Makevars
| and DESCRIPTION files to suit the most recent updates of their
| dependencies? I would have thought that such a need would break many
| packages.

I don't understand what you are trying to say.  R, as shown in the quote,
supports C++11 and even defaults to it.  What would break anywhere?

I was going to complain that you should include SystemRequirements: 
C++11, but on reading more closely, your Makevars.in specifies this in a 
different way.  So I guess the issue is with the Github Actions setup, 
which didn't spot the requirement.

Sorry for the noise...

Correct!  These are two different, and distinct, issues.

- CRAN checks for and uses _current_ packages with r-release and r-devel.
  C++11 is already a standard. Hence no change.

- OP had a problem because of a CI system that turns on older R versions for
  him. RcppArmadillo is a depends. And while RcppArmadillo has long allowed
  C++11, the (newer) dependency does not bubble up backwards from a dependee
  to the compiling package.  Hence the need to do it just as WRE describes.

No worries.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Conditional timeout for httr request when running R
 CMD check
Message-ID: <AM0PR06MB44359B3DE79CA8D9EB054DE5CCF50@AM0PR06MB4435.eurprd06.prod.outlook.com>

Dear all,

My package openSkies includes a set of functions to retrieve information from the OpenSky API.

The examples for these functions can, on rare occassions, take anomously longer times to complete than usually because of issues on the API side.

I have already included a timeout parameter to prevent endless attempts to retrieve the result when, for example, the API is down for maintenance.

I have recently been asked by CRAN to reduce the execution time of each example to below 5 s. In order to do this, I can set the timeout parameter to something below 5s, and return NULL and a message indicating the resource is not currently available. However, I think this might not be the best option for examples that demonstrate important functionalities to users.

Therefore, I was wondering if there is anyway to set up the timeout parameter to a different value than usual based on the condition that examples are being run as part of R CMD check?

Thanks a lot in advance

Best wishes,

Rafa

Don't test against a live website for most of your testing... use recorded or simulated input. If your package functional interface doesn't allow for that, then re-factor it so it does.

For those tests that actually have to interact with the live website, only run them if you know you are not on CRAN. The testthat package has support for this if you don't want to roll your own.

Dear package development mailing list,

I am trying to publish my package httpgd (https://github.com/nx10/httpgd)
which includes Boost Beast to CRAN but I am struggling to solve a CMD check
warning:

* checking whether package 'httpgd' can be installed ... WARNING
Found the following significant warnings:

The warning is only shown under windows and deep inside the Boost Beast.

Thank you for any help you can provide,

The problem here was regarding user facing example():s, not package tests.

In order to keep a neat example for the user to play with, I'd
probably wrap the example code in a \donttest{} statement.  Though, I
don't remember if CRAN tests with R CMD check --run-dontest, or not.
There's also \dontrun{}.

My $.02

I think the remotes::system_requirements() function is used in setting 
up the Github Action files; it doesn't appear to recognize the need of 
RcppArmadillo for C++11.  I've posted this as an issue on Github. 
Hopefully I'm not wrong about this too...

Dear all,

Thanks a lot for your replies. These have been really helpful for solving the issue with the examples run time.

I am also becoming interested in applying a similar solution for package tests.

I currently run tests with RUnit. Looking at testthat, I have seen tests can be skipped with skip_on_cran,
which seems to determine if tests are run on CRAN through the value of environment variable "NOT_CRAN"

Can I safely assume that NOT_CRAN will be "false" on CRAN machines?

Thanks a lot in advance

Best wishes,

Rafa

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] How to avoid R CMD check warning for documentation of
 non-package functions?
Message-ID: <CAM2gKPa-VmoXvi1mGct5y1Y5Donk9-B4M+t8RHUGPawaOFqRsQ@mail.gmail.com>

My package provides infrastructure support for callback functions
defined in special environments in user code. They are conceptually
similar (in fact, almost identical) to the `.onLoad` etc. ?hooks for
namespace events? in base R [1]. Now I?m adding documentation for
these functions, via the following Rd code (or the equivalent roxygen2
code annotating a `NULL` value):

```
\name{topicname}
\alias{topicname}
\alias{onload}
\title{Hooks for environment events}
\usage{
onload(env)
}
\arguments{
\item{env}{the environment}
}
\description{
Short description
}
```

Unfortunately, this causes an `R CMD check` warning:

>  Functions or methods with usage in documentation object 'topicname' but not in code:
>     ?onload?

Right: this function does not exist in my package, and it *should not*
exist in the package. Yet I do need to document it for users. What is
the recommended way for doing so? In fact, from my reading of the R
source, the base R documentation of ?ns-hooks? doesn?t seem to do
anything special, and would presumably also cause this warning.

I?m open to doing this differently, but I?d strongly prefer if these
functions had their own help topic, with their own ?usage? section. I
don?t just want to add them as a custom section to the package
documentation topic if this is at all avoidable.

[1]: https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/ns-hooks.html

PS: A note on API design, I considered doing this differently: rather
than define hooks via ?special names?, users would define them by
passing callbacks to a call to a package function; e.g.
`mypkg::define_onload(function (env) { ? })`. This would be
conceptually similar to R?s `setHook` [2]. However, from the user?s
point of view there?s no advantage to doing it this way, and it?s more
verbose. Defining callbacks via special names has ample precedence,
both in R and in other languages. And I don?t think `R CMD check`
warnings should dictate API design in this manner.

I haven't tried this, but I believe if you define functions with the 
right name and header in your package but don't export them the warning 
will go away.

If that doesn't work (or defining those causes other issues), a more 
involved workaround would be to change the \docType{} declaration for 
the help page.  \docType{package} is the most free-form, but you might 
get warned if you have two of them.  \docType{data} might be flexible 
enough.  If you do this, you won't use \usage{} or \arguments{}, you'll 
put together your own sections using \section{Usage}{ ... } and 
\section{Arguments}{ ... } and try to get the formatting right.

Thanks, works like a charm.

I?ll keep this in mind! It might come handy.

Is it possible to compose a string to be used as axis title in ggplot2,
with the main part being drawn using one given font and font size, and the
last part being drawn with another font and font size. See below for an
example

*my axis title **(units)*

Currently struggling to achieve this.
Thanks in advance for suggestions.

I think you have found your way onto the wrong list as R-help seems more 
appropriate.

When you do re-post please set your mailer to work in plain text not HTML.

Make sure you use the ggplot2 tag for your question.

Morning all

What's the best way to narrow down test errors that are occurring on
win-builder only?  I've tried checking the package on local installs
of r-devel (both 32 bit and 64bit), and on the Windows installs on
rhub and through GitHub actions.  On all of these systems the checks
pass without issue.

Is there anyway to match the configuration of the CRAN / win-builder machine?

Hi everyone,
This can be a very simple question, but I really have the following doubt.

CRAN Policies says that 'Packages should not modify the global environment
(user?s workspace)'. So, may I or may I not create a function that will
call internally the following code? (a simple example)

assign("name", 1, envir = .GlobalEnv)

Cheers
Tiago

You may not - and for good reason, as the user may have an existing variable called ?name? that will be destroyed by such an action.  If you run "R CMD check ?as-cran" on a package containing this code you will get a warning (or maybe a note, I can?t remember), and the package would most likely be refused if you tried to submit it to CRAN.

Cheers,

Matt

Thank Matt for your response.
Would be an acceptable solution to check if the variable exists first and
creating the new variable with a suffix? Please, see the following example

    var_name <-  "name"
    var_name <- ifelse(exists(var_name),
                         paste(var_name, "_vct", sep = ""),
                         var_name)
and then

assign(var_name, 1, envir = .GlobalEnv)

Cheers,
Tiago

   I think this solution will *not* be acceptable to CRAN. (The policy 
doesn't say "don't modify the global workspace unless you're careful", 
it says "don't modify the global workspace".)  You can ask for an 
exception, but your chances of success are very low.

    It would be best to find a way to solve your problem without 
assigning to the global workspace.  Can you assign to an environment 
that is contained within your package, which all of the functions in 
your package will also have access to?

   cheers

Thanks, everyone,

Following Mark suggestion:

The problem I'm trying to solve is:
Users of my package metan (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=metan),
sometimes need to extract 2-3 variables from a given data.frame and put
them as vectors in the global environment to use in other package's
functions.
Given that df has the columns, ENV, GEN, REP, I would need to run the
following codes
ENV <- df$ENV
GEN <- df$GEN
REP <- df$GEN
I'm looking for a more efficient way to do that and just finished the
following function

as_vector <- function(.data, ...){
  if(missing(...)){
    df <- select(.data, everything())
  } else{
    df <- select(.data, ...)
  }
  for(i in 1:ncol(df)){
    var_name <- names(df[i])
    var_name <- ifelse(exists(var_name, envir = .GlobalEnv),
                         paste(var_name, "_vct", sep = ""),
                         var_name)
    assign(var_name, as.vector(df[[i]]), envir = .GlobalEnv)
  }
}

Then, users could simply run as_vector(df) or  as_vector(df, GEN, ENV)
But I'm not sure if this fits with the CRAN policies.
Cherss,
Tiago

I think it would be helpful to describe more deeply what you're trying to
do by this. There's a fair chance there's a better way to do what you're
trying to do.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but this seems to be the purpose of the function
`with`?

https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/with

If that's the feature you're looking for, it would be the case of informing
your users to use that function when they want to refer to the columns
without the $.

Tiago, this may be a dumb question but what you are trying to do (below) sounds very similar to an existing function called attach() which many suggest has some dangers in use as you can overwrite or hide user variables or it can be eclipsed by later code:

https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/attach

Your version does try to use a secondary name if there is a clash but note if it is called repeatedly, it will make a tertiary and quaternary and beyond name by appending multiple copies of "_vct" one after another. I have seen people do this when making a unique tmp file.

And you do not show if these variable stuffed into an environment are eventually removed. Consider the variant described here:

https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/with

For clarity, you would use attach or with using a subset the columns of your data.frame that had just the variables you want.

A simple question is what the purpose of your change is. You want other functions run later to see these variables in their environment. Must they be global or can they be in an environment high enough in their search path. Some methods can make the change temporary and will unwind them. Some may keep the change permanent till the end of the session. 

I find that although it is tempting in base R to shorten use of names like $df$var_name to just var_name, use of a tidyverse package gets around it in a more limited way that does not so much impact what other functions see in the environment.

Thanks, everyone,

Following Mark suggestion:

The problem I'm trying to solve is:
Users of my package metan (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=metan),
sometimes need to extract 2-3 variables from a given data.frame and put them as vectors in the global environment to use in other package's functions.
Given that df has the columns, ENV, GEN, REP, I would need to run the following codes ENV <- df$ENV GEN <- df$GEN REP <- df$GEN I'm looking for a more efficient way to do that and just finished the following function

as_vector <- function(.data, ...){
  if(missing(...)){
    df <- select(.data, everything())
  } else{
    df <- select(.data, ...)
  }
  for(i in 1:ncol(df)){
    var_name <- names(df[i])
    var_name <- ifelse(exists(var_name, envir = .GlobalEnv),
                         paste(var_name, "_vct", sep = ""),
                         var_name)
    assign(var_name, as.vector(df[[i]]), envir = .GlobalEnv)
  }
}

Then, users could simply run as_vector(df) or  as_vector(df, GEN, ENV) But I'm not sure if this fits with the CRAN policies.
Cherss,
Tiago

 CRAN packages suggesting other packages but not using
 them conditionally
Message-ID: <QB1PR01MB32663713573A71E5ECA661DEABC90@QB1PR01MB3266.CANPRD01.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

I got the email below concerning 3 of my packages but wonder if they are false alarms or
if not, how to locate & fix the problem.

    This concerns packages: ...

    Suggested packages should be used conditionally: see ?1.1.3.1 of 'Writing R Extensions'.  Some of these are hard to install on a platform without X11 such as M1 Macs: see the logs at https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/bdr/M1mac/.

    You can check all of the suggested packages by setting environment variable _R_CHECK_DEPENDS_ONLY_=true  -- see https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-devel/R-ints.html#Tools .

Is this a false alarm?

In each case, the outfile contains:

    * checking package namespace information ... OK
    * checking package dependencies ... NOTE
    Package suggested but not available for checking: 'rgl'

indicating that rgl is not avaiable on the testing machine.  Then, when checking examples an error is triggered
when an example calls something that requires rgl.

    >

    Failed with error:  'there is no package called 'rgl''
    Error in heplot3d.mlm(Adopted.mod, hypotheses = list(Reg = c("AMED", "BMIQ")),  :
      rgl package is required.
    Calls: heplot3d -> heplot3d.mlm
    Execution halted

Yet, heplot3d seems to contain the required way to refer to the suggested rgl package:

                if (!requireNamespace("rgl")) stop("rgl package is required.")

So, I'm mystified.  Can anyone help?

Message-ID: <CAG0gC1dV0U2sdhb43v7rST3FEcRAqLWhFnvqDAtdEv3gzQFw4w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
I am trying to submit my first CRAN package, but I am having problems to
reproduce and correct all the issues that have been been reported by the
first failed attempt.
The package has quite a significant amount of Fortran 2003 code, and few
lines of C to link with R.
I hope some of you might give me some insight on how to correct them. I
will list the errors here below.

Relatively to the Windows test it has been reported to the following.

The warning "implicit declaration of function 'gamma'
[-Wimplicit-function-declaration]", refers to the fact that I am
calling the "gamma" function from Rmath.h in the following code block.

#include <R.h>
> #include <Rmath.h>
> ...
> //** Gamma function
> double r__gamma (double *a) {

> */
> //_MAIN_
> return(gamma(a[0]));
> }

The fatal error, refers to the fact the compiler cannot find the
env.mod module, but the Makefile is correctly defined.

Relatively to the Debian test, the following warning is what is making
to fail the submission.

* checking whether package ?modello? can be installed ... [32s/32s] WARNING
> Found the following significant warnings:
>   Warning: Type specified for intrinsic function ?size? at (1) is ignored [-Wsurprising]
>   Warning: ?__var_1_fcn.offset? is used uninitialized in this function [-Wuninitialized]
>   Warning: ?__var_2_fcn.offset? is used uninitialized in this function [-Wuninitialized]

I have fixed the two warning due to uninitialized variables. However I
cannot reproduce the  warning "Type specified for intrinsic function
?size? at (1) is ignored [-Wsurprising]" and I do not know how to fix
it. Googling a bit I understand it could be false positive (e.g.
https://www.mail-archive.com/gcc-bugs at gcc.gnu.org/msg537501.html)

I would be very glad if anyone could give me advice on how to fix
these issues. Thanks in advance.

Regards,

Filippo

This is not conditional use in the sense of my reading of WRE.

What you have here is essentially an "assert()" and equivalent to
  stopifnot(requireNamespace("rgl"))
which, in turn, is equivalent to a strong Depends or Imports as your package
will experience a _critical error_ triggered by `stop()` if rgl is missing.

The idea of a conditional use is to, well, be conditional. Below I make use
of Rcpp if is present, but it is only a suggests:

  ## see the source files in the snippets/ directory of the package
  ## check for (optional, only in Suggests:) Rcpp, and also wrapped in a
  ## dontrun as it takes 10s at CRAN (yet only 3.5 here) yielding a NOTE
  if (requireNamespace("Rcpp", quietly=TRUE)) {
      Rcpp::sourceCpp(system.file("snippets", "convolveExample.cpp", package="tidyCpp"))
  }

If the _suggested_ package is present, it is used. If not we quietly move on. 
(It's not the full story as the compilation occassionally takes longer,
Windows complained so all this is now in a \dontrun{} block too. But the idea
is generic and there are many more examples to be found.)

Hope this helps,  Dirk

Examples should use dontrun to avoid calling functions that call stop.

   I think you're supposed to skip the example (throwing a warning, if 
you like ...) if rgl isn't available, rather than throwing an error ... ?

Thanks, Dirk

Just to clarify--
In my packages, candisc, heplots, vcdExtra I have mostly 2D graphic methods, but some 3D methods that use
rgl.  I therefore put rgl into Suggests:

Could I solve this by making rgl a Depends: ?

This is not conditional use in the sense of my reading of WRE.

What you have here is essentially an "assert()" and equivalent to
  stopifnot(requireNamespace("rgl"))
which, in turn, is equivalent to a strong Depends or Imports as your package will experience a _critical error_ triggered by `stop()` if rgl is missing.

The idea of a conditional use is to, well, be conditional. Below I make use of Rcpp if is present, but it is only a suggests:

  ## see the source files in the snippets/ directory of the package
  ## check for (optional, only in Suggests:) Rcpp, and also wrapped in a
  ## dontrun as it takes 10s at CRAN (yet only 3.5 here) yielding a NOTE
  if (requireNamespace("Rcpp", quietly=TRUE)) {
      Rcpp::sourceCpp(system.file("snippets", "convolveExample.cpp", package="tidyCpp"))
  }

If the _suggested_ package is present, it is used. If not we quietly move on. 
(It's not the full story as the compilation occassionally takes longer, Windows complained so all this is now in a \dontrun{} block too. But the idea is generic and there are many more examples to be found.)

Hope this helps,  Dirk

	  I have tests in my code to detect when something like that is not 
available.


	  I also have code in "\examples" to skip tests that would encounter 
that.


	  Hadley's "testthhat:skip_on_cran" is supposed to suppress tests like 
that on CRAN.  I have so far failed to understand how to use this 
function that Hadley wrote.  Instead, I use things like the following:


if(!fda::CRAN()){
# Code that I want to run everyplace that's NOT CRAN


}


	  When I wrote "fda::CRAN", I was told that I shouldn't do it, but I 
didn't see a better option, and I've been using it for several years now 
without being given a reason to discontinue using it or (better?) being 
given an alternative that seems better to me.

Hi Michael,

It should be fine to have rgl in Suggests, and to have the 3D graphics 
functions that use rgl throw an error if rgl is absent. What's not fine 
is having these errors triggered in the absence of rgl when examples are 
run or vignettes are compiled.

Putting rgl into Depends rather than Suggests would make the problem 
worse, because you couldn't then load your package without rgl.

So, as I believe a couple of others have suggested, wrap the problematic 
examples in, e.g., if(requireNamespace("rgl")){}, and do something 
similar in the vignettes.

I hope this helps,
  John

   Apologies if I'm telling you something you already know:

   By default, fda::CRAN() uses the presence of environment variables 
matched by the regexp "^_R_" as a heuristic to decide whether it's being 
running on CRAN.

   testthat::skip_on_cran()  calls testthat::on_cran() to look for an 
environment variable called NOT_CRAN equal to "true". The 
devtools::check() machinery automatically sets this variable.


   So: fda::CRAN() depends on breakable assumptions, defaults to FALSE 
in an empty environment.  skip_on_cran() defaults to TRUE in an empty 
environment (but defaults to FALSE in a devtools::check() environment).

Error: 'on_cran' is not an exported object from 'namespace:testthat'


	  Besides, on my Mac, I get:

[1] TRUE


	  My Mac is NOT CRAN, and I don't want that function to return TRUE on 
my computer unless I explicitly run "R CMD check --on-cran".

	  If future changes break fda::CRAN, I will have to deal with it then.


	  I'd be happier if the CRAN maintainers would develop a procedure to 
make it easier for package maintainers do two things:


		    * Include tests in their package that run longer than the time 
limit permitted on CRAN.


		    * Give error messages that the package maintainer wants to see but 
that should be suppressed on CRAN or when the user decides to run "R CMD 
check --as-cran".


	  In any event, I hope that I'll be able to continue using fda::CRAN as 
I have been.  If not, I will be forced to reduce the coverage of test 
suites everywhere I use fda::CRAN.  That in turn will make the code 
harder to maintain and more easily broken in ways that I can no longer 
easily test.

      on_cran() is intended to be used via testthat::skip_on_cran() 
(which is exported, unlike on_cran()).

   The assumption of testthat is that it's going to be deployed via 
devtools::check(), which automatically sets the environment variable 
NOT_CRAN equal to 'true'. For testing on your machine, you could use

Sys.setenv(NOT_CRAN="true"); testthat:::on_cran()

or you could put

export NOT_CRAN=true

in the shell/in your testing pipeline.

  I agree that this would be nice.

   A simple mechanism would be to set an official/sanctioned/stable 
environment variable such as _R_ON_CRAN in all CRAN testing pipelines.

That's very easy now.  Just put them in a "slowtests" directory, and 
tell R CMD check to use that.  How could it be easier?

What's wrong with users setting NOT_CRAN on all non-CRAN testing pipelines?

Most people want the same tests in both places.  Those who like writing 
lots of time consuming tests are the ones who shouldn't mind a small 
step to control them.

    How would you do that?  In "R CMD check --help" I see that one can 
use --test-dir= to specify the test directory, but I don't see a way to 
specify _additional_ test directories; short of setting a tests/ 
directory with CRAN-specific tests and a slowtests/ directory with 
*both* CRAN-specific and CRAN-excluded tests (thus duplicating files, 
which seems clunky), I don't see how to do this within a standard R CMD 
check framework (without testing a CRAN-indicating environment variable, 
which gets us back where we started ...)  Or would you run R CMD check 
twice, once without and once with --test-dir=slowtests ?

   There doesn't seem to be very much in "Writing R Extensions" about 
testing - a little bit in
https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#Package-subdirectories

   What am I missing?

  Just to clarify, the ideal would be to be able to designate a separate 
set of tests that were *not* run on CRAN, and to be able to run them in 
the same "R CMD check" pass as the CRAN-specific tests.  There are a 
bunch of ways to achieve this, but I think Spencer is saying (and I 
agree) that it would be nice if it were there an official mechanism that 
made this easier (and it seems pretty easy if the CRAN maintainers were 
agreeable to the idea ...)

   This is where we started. Nothing's wrong with it, but setting 
_R_CRAN=true on CRAN testing pipelines and providing an on_cran() 
function in the utils package would also seem almost trivially easy for 
R-core/CRAN maintainers, and would simplify the process for R package 
developers who are less familiar with shell/scripting/etc. (although I 
admit that (wanting_to_skip_tests && not_familiar_with_env_vars && 
not_working_in_devtoolsverse) could be a small intersection ...)

   True. It doesn't take that much to exceed 10 minutes on the CRAN 
windows pipeline any more, though.  I have 56 separate test files in 
lme4; on the Windows pipeline it takes 3 seconds just to *load* the lme4 
package, and every file gets tested on ix386 and x86_64, so I would use 
up about 6 minutes of my 10-minute checking budget before I even got 
started ...

    (Yes, I know I could combine the files so that I have to load the 
package less often during the testing phase, or possibly eliminate the 
library() calls - I don't remember whether test files have to run in a 
standalone R session, although it certainly seems like best practice).

What I would do is have the slowtests run the regular tests.  So if I 
want both, I run slowtests.  If I want just the fast ones, I don't 
specify.  I can't think why I wouldn't want to run the slow ones without 
the fast ones, but if I did, it's not too hard to figure out a scheme 
that runs fast by default, slow when requested, and both if you request 
that instead.

Yes, do that as described above.

There is such a mechanism, and I've just described it (and not for the 
first time; it's also described in WRE).  I think the problem is that 
you and Spencer are looking for something that's more complicated.  It 
doesn't need to be complicated.

	  I want to put all the tests of a particular function in the 
"\examples" section.  If some things are too pedantic to show to a user, 
I can put them in "\dontshow".  If they run too long for CRAN, I wrap 
them in "if(!fda::CRAN()){...}", as I previously noted.


	  Putting slow tests in a "slowtest" directory to me violates a 
sensible rule of documentation, because it makes it harder to think 
about how complete a test suite is.


	  I probably should not broaden this discussion to include "\dontrun", 
but I will:  I think any example in "\dontrun" should be made to work 
and wrapped in something like "if(!fda::CRAN()){...}" if you don't want 
it to be run on CRAN, where you don't care if it breaks or not.  I've 
read too many books with examples that didn't work!  The "fda" package 
has 76 reverse dependencies.  I think most of those are attributable to 
the quality of the fundamental ideas, but I'd like to think that some of 
them are because I insisted in included decent unit tests in the 
"\examples" -- AND because I insisted on make sure all but a couple of 
the examples in the book actually worked!


	  Thanks very much to everyone who has contributed to this thread.  I 
don't think we've reached a consensus, but we've had a good discussion 
and may eventually help improve package documentation and testing 
practices in the future.


	  Spencer

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] First time CRAN submission
Message-ID: <CAG0gC1fhxFe=cNCpLWS6SuxaNBbAr_S7E1N3pF+WCuBOTR8kJA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,
I am trying to submit my first package to CRAN. I already went through few
iterations and corrected most of the problems (I believe). However I still
getting two issues that I cannot figure out hoe to fix. I will list them
here below, hoping for some help. You can find the package that I am trying
to submit at https://gitlab.com/ingfimo/modello.

With respect to the Windows test this is the output that has been returned
to me:

> * using log directory 'd:/RCompile/CRANincoming/R-devel/modello.Rcheck'

"package 'modello' is not installed for 'arch = i386'"

With respect to the Debian test the warning that makes the submission to
fail is the following:

> * checking whether package ?modello? can be installed ... [33s/32s] WARNING
> Found the following significant warnings:
> Warning: Type specified for intrinsic function ?size? at (1) is ignored
> [-Wsurprising]
> See ?/srv/hornik/tmp/CRAN/modello.Rcheck/00install.out? for details.

which relates to few workings of the fololwing kind:

> Warning: Type specified for intrinsic function ?size? at (1) is ignored
> [-Wsurprising]

and

> Warning: ?ss.dim[1].stride? may be used uninitialized in this function
> [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]

I cannot reproduce these warnings on my environments, even by using -Wall
and -Wextra during the compilation. Googling the topic I found that it
could be bug in an old version of gcc (
https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=77504).

Any advice on how to further proceed with the submission are welcome.

Regards,
Filippo

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Vignette fonts problem
Message-ID: <6c897957-cbeb-21fa-3960-2841f457331b@umu.se>

I have built and checked eha_2.8.2 with R-4.0.3 and everything is OK.

However, checking with the current (2020-12-12) R-devel, I get:

--- re-building ?tpchreg.Rmd? using rmarkdown
Quitting from lines 103-108 (tpchreg.Rmd)
Error: processing vignette 'tpchreg.Rmd' failed with diagnostics:
X11 font -adobe-helvetica-%s-%s-*-*-%d-*-*-*-*-*-*-*, face 1 at size 12 
could not be loaded
--- failed re-building ?tpchreg.Rmd?

In 'tpchreg.Rmd' I have:

---
title: "Proportional hazards regression with tabular data"
author: "G?ran Brostr?m"
package: eha
date: "`r Sys.Date()`"
slug: eha
link-citations: yes
output:
     bookdown::html_document2:
         toc: yes
         toc_depth: 2
pkgdown:
     as_is: true
bibliography: mybib.bib
vignette: >
   %\VignetteIndexEntry{Proportional hazards regression with tabular data}
   %\VignetteEngine{knitr::rmarkdown}
   %\VignetteEncoding{UTF-8}
   \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
---

and the lines 103-108 are:

```{r glmbasefig,  fig.cap = "Age-specific mortality, Sweden 1968-2019. 
Poisson regression."}
oldpar <- par(las = 1, lwd = 1.5, mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(0:(n-1), haz, type = "s", main = "log(hazards)",
      xlab = "Age", ylab = "", log = "y")
plot(0:(n-1), haz, type = "s", main = "hazards",
      xlab = "Age", ylab = "Deaths / Year")
```

So, why do I get the fonts error now (and not earlier) and where can I 
find the fonts? (Ubuntu 20.04). And will it help, so the package is 
accepted by CRAN?

Thanks, G?ran

Update: I tried this on another machine with the same setup (I thought), 
and no problem with the R-devel check!

Must find those fonts ...

On CRAN soon!
