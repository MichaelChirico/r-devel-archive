Hello there again,

I found (in --help) the `R CMD INSTALL` 
flag `--configure-args`, and were 
successfully able to install it:

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Lazy data compression for packages without data folder
Message-ID: <e7ddc148-15b1-b798-1ba7-31a21eb4a2a0@web.de>

Hi,  

I just noticed that, last week-end, R CMD build was changed to remove ?LazyData? and
?LazyDataCompression? fields from the ?DESCRIPTION? file of packages without a ?data?
directory.

Now, in our package "RobAStRDA" published on CRAN in version 1.2.0 2019-03-11, we 
deliberately do have a ?LazyData? field in the ?DESCRIPTION? file of the package
without a ?data? folder.

This package just contains a sysdata.rda file with a large amount of interpolation grids
and functions not to be analyzed as statistical data but rather to be used for speed-ups
in our package "RobExtremes" (also on CRAN).

What is the recommended way to achieve this, i.e., use the sysdata.rda file in compressed
form and in lazy data format without placing it into a ?data? folder?

Any suggestions welcome,
best regards, Peter (Ruckdeschel)

Message-ID: <CAK68aVVU_V2uduNfEcjzL_KECgT5c2U_VgZ9WeZae1iwKEo=DA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have an atypical use case in which I have a build system
<https://github.com/grailbio/rules_r/> that can build C shared libraries
that will be used by the native code in an R package, and build both C
libraries and R packages in one user command. As these shared libraries are
specified by the build system itself, I do not want to assume their names
and locations in the R package src/Makevars. Going through the configure
script mechanism is not straightforward for arbitrary R packages that can
be used in the build system, because all user input is pre-specified before
the build steps are run, and so the shared library names and locations may
not be available when the user is specifying the build, or the configure
script may not be flexible enough to take such input from the user.

My question is if there is any guidance on what is the best way to set
PKG_LIBS and PKG_CPPFLAGS variables from the command line rather than
expecting them in the package src/Makevars? As part of my build system,
even if I create or edit the package src/Makevars, it could be replaced or
changed in arbitrary ways by the configure script.

So far, I have been exporting PKG_LIBS and PKG_CPPFLAGS as environment
variables before running R CMD INSTALL (my build script
<https://github.com/grailbio/rules_r/blob/d4b3a80bba49c5b540e72ca3a9fcc9ef1e5af93c/R/scripts/build.sh#L191>),
and then assuming that if the user has these variables in the package
src/Makevars, then they are appending to an existing list (e.g. by using
`+=`), rather than replacing it (by using `=`). But I am not sure if this
is the best way.

It could be that I am thinking about this all wrong, so would appreciate
some guidance.

There has been some discussion on how to do this best on Github
<https://github.com/RcppCore/RcppArmadillo/pull/331>, but we thought it
would be best if we started a discussion here.

Thank you.

Siddhartha

I don't think those settings apply to that file. Search for "sysdata.rda" in [1].

I tried to replicate this error with R-hub but it works well. What can I do to simulate CRAN?s environment in S 10 and fix this problem?

Any help from you will be highly appreciated!

Best,

It is difficult to say more than Dave and I said in comments to your post on
this at StackOverflow:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66894044/memory-not-mapped-error-in-r-on-solaris-10

None of us have access to the exact same configuration as that test machine.

Have you run the offending examples under valgrind on Linux with

Message-ID: <916FE36D-C70F-4E00-AC87-9335B4AA5A0C@dal.ca>

The "oce" package for oceanographic analysis is failing a check on the r-devel-windows-x86_64-gcc10-UCRT system (see
https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/R.check/r-devel-windows-x86_64-gcc10-UCRT/oce-00check.html). The problem seems to relate to the checking vignette outputs.

According to https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/winutf8/ucrt3/CRAN/checks/gcc10-UCRT/README.txt, that test setup is experimental.  Does that mean that I ought to I ignore the FAIL status for this machine, perhaps checking it once in a while to see if it changes?

Alternatively, if I am advised to fix the problem, I wonder whether there a way for me to run tests with rhub, winbuilder, or something similar?  (I do not have access to a windows machine.)

Thanks in advance for any help that can be provided.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Using RC_fopen in a CRAN package
Message-ID: <b05557c3fa02b9da23b8e0809923f00c5ea64f88.camel@gmail.com>

I?d like to ask for clarification about CRAN policies regarding usage
of functions that start with "RC_*", such as "RC_fopen".

I'm trying to upload a package which is meant for reading and writing
data from text files in a certain format, for which I want to use a C
file pointer which I obtain through "RC_fopen". The R extensions manual
says the following:
"... there are other header files there that can be included too, but
many of the features they contain should be regarded as undocumented
and unstable."

Since "RC_fopen" is present in a header file, I would guess it should
be classified as "public" within the entry points classification
(between API/public/private/hidden). This is the description for such
entry points in the manual:
"Entry points declared in an installed header file that are exported on
all R platforms but are not documented and subject to change without
notice."

As I understand it, there is nothing that would forbid using public
entry points compared to the explicit point made about "private" entry
points. However, when I try to submit the package to CRAN, it doesn't
make it past the automated checks due to a NOTE:
Check: compiled code, Result: NOTE
  File 'readsparse/libs/readsparse.so':
    Found non-API call to R: 'RC_fopen'
  
  Compiled code should not call non-API entry points in R.
  
  See 'Writing portable packages' in the 'Writing R Extensions' manual.


Is it allowed to use such functions in packages? I see a few packages
currently in CRAN have the same note in the checks, such as "iotools",
and am wondering if I should just email the CRAN maintainer explaining
that I intend to use the function anyway, since it's just a note rather
than a warning or error.

The CRAN policy document is quite clear on this: "CRAN packages should 
use only the public API. Hence they should not use entry points not 
declared as API in installed headers nor .Internal() nor .Call() etc 
calls to base packages. Also, ::: should not be used to access 
undocumented/internal objects in base packages (nor should other means 
of access be employed). Such usages can cause packages to break at any 
time, even in patched versions of R. "

So you are free to use that function, but CRAN won't publish your 
package if you do.

What you can do is to republish the functions in a package you own and
maintain, and then export them from there. I have done that in RApiDatetime
for some date/time parsing code, and in RApiSerialize for serialization.

It is not ideal as your copies may become stale over time. But it gives you a
way forward as long as R Core exercises their right to have non-public APIs.
As R Core has demonstrated exemplary fidelity to the parts of the API that
are public, we should not be too grumpy that they reserve this option.

Hello Daniel;

I'm not speaking for CRAN. I'm another maintainer whose current status 
page has a FAIL for that platform. But the FAIL notation is due at least 
in part to the fact that apparently the UCRT platform is less frequently 
run on the full CRAN package holdings. The note refers to a package that 
was updated a few days ago. The log file however has two other reports 
of failure relating to compiler warnings.

All the other platforms passed the newer versions. There is no mention 
of the UCRT platform at the CRAN Policies page: 
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html

I'm waiting to see whether the aging fortran code generates warnings 
whenever the UCRT platform gets fired up again.

A new check, you declare LazyData in your DESCRIPTION file which is 
meaningless. So please simply omit that line.

A similarly looking problem exists for multiple packages. It may be 
related to some setup on the checking system or some more general 
problem not specifically related to your package, I didn't yet have time 
to diagnose.

> Alternatively, if I am advised to fix the problem, I wonder whether there a way for me to run tests with rhub, winbuilder, or something similar?  (I do not have access to a windows machine.)
For now there is a virtual machine setup (you can install a 
free-for-testing Windows virtual machine). A link is in the README or here
https://developer.r-project.org/Blog/public/2021/03/18/virtual-windows-machine-for-checking-r-packages/index.html 


This is available for package developers to debug issues with their 
packages, but in this case it really may be something unrelated to your 
package, so unless you wanted to volunteer your time diagnosing this, 
please ignore.

Best
Tomas

Message-ID: <CAOK8EzfgUK4jNtXE6zE4-Mxig=VoR5nAMXw517ypzJvRPd6Avg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I am a bit puzzled by this error for the sigQC package being uploaded to
CRAN. Checks on my end pass without issue. There is one error regarding the
bioConductor dependency RankProd that comes up only on the Debian OS when
checking. See here for further details:
https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/sigQC_0.1.22_20210406_110708/

I am not sure how to resolve this - it seems to me that the dependency
*should* be available across platforms, and short of removing the
dependency (which we rely on a fair bit), I'm not sure what  we can do.

Any thoughts or suggestions would be massively appreciated.

Thank you so kindly!
Andrew

These are Notes as it may not be a serious issue or may be a false 
positive, nevertheless, we like to get clean packages to CRAN.

WARNINGs and ERRORs will never be accepted.

The policies clearly say that significant Notes have to be addressed.
The only Note that is always acceptable is the CRAN maintainer Note 
about the package maintainer's address. All other Notes should be fixed 
generally or need manual attention in case of the really very few 
exceptions.

Uwe Ligges

this?

Andrew,

I think if you want to include a Bioconductor dependency, then I think you
add the "biocViews:" line to your description file to enable bioconductor
package installation.

See this answer on Bioinformatics stackexchange:
https://bioinformatics.stackexchange.com/a/3375/51

Hope that helps!

-Robert

I had a similar problem with intepreting "notes" in pgirmess checks. 
Some are lethal and lead to rejection and some not (just informative 
comments). Fortunately Uwe has been kind enough to tell me what I missed 
(I thought that all notes were just "informative").
Would it be possible to call lethal notes "errors" to keep us aware that 
we must really do something with them and fix what is actually a problem?
Best,
Patrick

Message-ID: <DD27B476-6D93-4F8A-9A59-A0B21E24747E@precisionmethods.guru>

For version 0.2-2 of my ?precautionary? package, I have added fast numerical routines implemented in Rust.
In my DESCRIPTION file, I am ?LinkingTo: cargo (>= 0.1.28)?, but fail incoming check on Win-builder as follows:

As I understand the intention of package cargo https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cargo, it aims to solve precisely this problem.
Other platforms check my package just fine.
Is the solution to be found in configuration of Win-builder, in my Makevars.win, or elsewhere?
I have taken my Makevars.win straight from https://github.com/extendr/helloextendr/blob/main/src/Makevars.win as follows:


TARGET = $(subst 64,x86_64,$(subst 32,i686,$(WIN)))-pc-windows-gnu

Hi Robert,

Thank you for replying! I already had the biocViews: line on my description
file - it seems it must be something else contributing to the issue.

I think this is the pertinent error:

> make: cargo: Command not found

That is, make is assuming that the cargo utility is installed and
available on the PATH, but that doesn't appear to be true on the CRAN
winbuilder machine.

The salso package (https://cran.r-project.org/package=salso)
explicitly requires cargo to be already available, per
SystemRequirements:

SystemRequirements: Cargo (>= 1.42.0) for installation from sources:
see file INSTALL

so you probably need to do something similar. I'd also recommend
downloading the 'salso' package to see how they resolve this, or
contacting the 'salso' maintainer to see what steps they took to
ensure their package could build on CRAN.

Best,
Kevin

My DESCRIPTION has the same ?SystemRequirements: ?? line as salso?from which I probably copied it.

I had briefly reached out to ?cargo? author (who is also ?salso? author), who indicated I might need to supply binaries.
Indeed, on closer look, salso appears to include the binaries, rather than asking CRAN to do the build:
https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/R.check/r-devel-windows-x86_64-gcc10-UCRT/salso-00check.html

Thus, it seems ?precautionary? presents an opportunity to get Rust compilation working on Win-builder.
Rust is such a fine language that it would be a shame not to smooth this out for the community.

OTOH, crucial calculations in ?precautionary? parallelize so nicely with mclapply() that it would not be inappropriate to bypass (forkless) Win by setting OS_type to unix.

Not needed for CRAN.

You simply need to declare the dependency, but BioC 3.13 is what we 
should use to check with R-devel and that was recetnly still pretty 
iunstable.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] rtracklayer installation problems
Message-ID: <006301d72b8a$dc59c1b0$950d4510$@unina.it>

Hi everyone,

 

I hope this is the right e-mail I should have used; this is the first time
that I ask for help with R!

Yesterday, I installed the devel version of R (4.1) as I need to use a
package (RiboDiPa) which only works for this version.

The package requires, among the others, the package "rtracklayer". Since
yesterday I am struggling trying to install rtracklayer for devel version
without success.

Below you can find the final message I got before the installation stops.
Any idea of what might be the reason why I cannot install rtracklayer? 

 

ucsc/udc.c:46:10: fatal error: sys/mman.h: No such file or directory

#include <sys/mman.h>

          ^~~~~~~~~~~~

compilation terminated.

make: *** [Makevars.win:16: ucsc/udc.o] Error 1

ERROR: compilation failed for package 'rtracklayer'

* removing 'C:/Users/Rosario/Documents/R/win-library/4.1/rtracklayer'

 

If you need any other information please, do not hesitate to ask.

Thank you in advance for your help!

 

Best,

Rosario

rtracklayer is a Bioconductor package, so you're probably better off 
asking on their support site https://support.bioconductor.org/.  When 
you do, please show the command you used for the install; it's possible 
a simple change there will fix things.

Hi, Rosario,

The message is telling you that you need to install the development header files for glibc on your computer.  This is a set of files that are needed for building some kinds of software, but are not installed by default.  Are you working on some sort of Linux machine?  On Centos 8, the relevant package to install is called "glibc-headers".  On Ubuntu 20.04 it's "libc6-dev".  You'd need to run a command in the shell, something like:

Centos:
> sudo dnf install glibc-headers
or
> sudo yum install glibc-headers

Ubuntu/Debian:
> sudo apt install libc6-dev

If it's Windows or Mac, I can't help...

If you don't have root access on your host, or the above doesn't make sense to you, you will need to talk to whoever administers your computing environment, asking them to install the relevant package.

Hope this helps.

Dear all,
I am trying to submit a package to CRAN that depends on Bioconductor
packages. On debian, I do not have any problems so far. But when checking
for windows I get several errors:

Error: package or namespace load failed for 'Gviz' in loadNamespace(j
<- i[[1L]], c(lib.loc, .libPaths()), versionCheck = vI[[j]]):
 namespace 'rtracklayer' 1.48.0 is already loaded, but >= 1.51.5 is required
Error: package 'Gviz' could not be loaded
In addition: Warning message:
multiple methods tables found for 'export'
Execution halted
ERROR: lazy loading failed for package 'RTIGER'
* removing 'd:/RCompile/CRANincoming/R-devel/lib/RTIGER'
* restoring previous 'd:/RCompile/CRANincoming/R-devel/lib/RTIGER'

Could someone help me?

Thank you very much,

Rafael

so there is currently no Windows binary available. This is in the hands of the rtracklayer maintainer; there is a very high likelihood that it will be fixed, so either be patient or ask the rtracklayer maintainer directly to address this by, e.g., opening an issue at https://github.com/lawremi/rtracklayer

Reason is that BioC 3.13 does not offer a new rtracklayer binary which 
the winbuilder machine typically uses.
As this also does not install from sources for me. So this seems hard to 
set up.

Thank you again Uwe,

So, to clarify - is the error occurring because RankProd is not found in
BioC 3.13 (current release is 3.12)?  If so, I'm not sure how I can fix
this...

Thanks
Andrew

I suspect the only thing you could do in the short term is to remove 
that dependency (or move it to Suggests, and check for it before using). 
  If that's not feasible, then you just need to wait for it to become 
available.  Based on its status page, it shouldn't be long.  Try 
submitting again tomorrow?

Follow-up on UCRT package checks for muhaz package. When the version 
that corrected R code errors was eventually run, it now has a status of 
"OK". Apparently the warnings about the Fortran code are not 
sufficiently worrisome. It still have an LTO link but the status page 
doesn't even consider the warnings contained therein to be worthy of 
being called warnings or notes.

Message-ID: <CECC916B-ADFF-48D0-A88C-622AAF240703@noaa.gov>

Hi All:

I still have problems with checking one of my packages on RHub running Debian,  as the Preprocessing fails in building in some of the needed spatial packages.  This problem was reported quite awhile ago,  and never appears to have been completely fixed.  Is there an alternate place I can test a package under Debian that is consistent with CRAN.

Thanks,

-Roy

Hi,

Which one is your package? Which spatial package fails? Can you link
to an issue in the issue tracker, if there is one?

As for an alternative, you can run a Docker container. This works on
Linux, Windows and macOS, on any recent enough machine. You can run
one of the R-hub containers, e.g.
https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/rhub/debian-gcc-devel and
then try to fix the installation issue. Or you can try a bigger
container that tries to mirror CRAN exactly:
https://hub.docker.com/r/cran/debian

Thanks Gabor.  I will post more information later today when I get a chance.  I actually put something on issue tracker a year or two ago,  after posting here and having suggested that I raise an issue.

I really appreciate the work going into RHub - the reason I am having this problem is I use RHub to check my submissions.  I just keep failing in my CRAN submissions on Debian while passing on Windows and Mac, sort of frustrating.

My apologies, it is the Fedora instance.  Short version summary:

Warning messages:
5558#> 1: In i.p(...) : installation of package ?rgdal? had non-zero exit status
5559#> 2: In i.p(...) : installation of package ?sf? had non-zero exit status
5560#> 3: In i.p(...) :
5561#> installation of package ?plotdap? had non-zero exit status

'plotdap' depends on sf which is why it fails.  Long version is at https://builder.r-hub.io/status/rerddapXtracto_1.1.0.tar.gz-f3facfb7e282436c98dce8b5014de474

Thanks,

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Package Vignette depends on Ensembl,
 server certificate issue?
Message-ID: <6791A218-1632-49B0-B4CE-33E9306B9EA8@aggregate-genius.com>

Hello,
I have a package (DGEobj) that depends on the Ensembl service to look up information used to build the vignette.  My builds work fine on Travis, locally and on R-hub.  Occasionally I have seen blips with regard to internet-based resources not being available, and my vignette depends on a number of internet resources to get example datasets.  However when I submitted my package to CRAN today the failures Windows and Debian were that the server certificate verification failed ( SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate).
I?m not sure if there is something I can do about this or if this is considered a "false positive" per the email - it seems like a "wait and retry" issue.  I don?t want to be rude uploading the package again without a change or erroneously emailing in response to the rejection. 
How should this be handled properly now and into the future?  It isn?t feasible to not use Ensembl for this vignette.
Thanks for your insight and feedback!

Maybe use r.rsp?

How to include my pre-print / cheatsheet as a PDF vignette?

Long story short, the problem turned out to be that I called basename()
and dirname() on paths not guaranteed to exist. Thanks to Tomas
Kalibera for pointing me in the right direction!

I'd wager a guess that I would have reproduced the same issue on an
Intel macOS machine with Big Sur installed (this being the other main
difference between Intel/High Sierra machines where all tests passed
and the M1/Big Sur machine where they failed). The "package check
results" page now shows all "OK" for the updated version, so I must
have fixed it.

I guess the moral of the story is that sometimes, it's easier to fix a
problem than reproduce it for oneself.

Message-ID: <defcdd886d3b41b597af2946ebad81e4@umcutrecht.nl>

Dear all,


The package I've tried to submit uses HTSlib, which in turn uses libcurl.  >From the build logs, I think there is a version mismatch, or configuration problem with libcurl:

https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/USCDtools_0.0.1_20210409_093124/Windows/00install.out

The problem seems to boil down to:
<https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/USCDtools_0.0.1_20210409_093124/Windows/00install.out>

undefined reference to `_imp__CertEnumCertificatesInStore at 8'

Can I do anything about it in my package?

Kind regards,
Roel Janssen

Also can I get the IP address of the the machine that runs the Solaris 
test?  I am befuddled that the Solaris test can not access our server at 
all.  We did have to block a number of IP addresses recently,  my

The list does not know. Even the CRAN team does not know the IP address. 
Professor Ripley runs that machine, so you may ask him via 
CRAN at R-project.org.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Advice on identifying parsing failures with examples
 when trying to pkgdown my package
Message-ID: <1519420434.4858511.1618082882884.JavaMail.zimbra@psyctc.org>

My beginner package https://github.com/cpsyctc/CECPfuns is evolving slowly and I had no problems (that I could see)
with the help pages created through roxygen.  Today I came back to try using pkgdown to ... pkgdown the package.  
So I used a copy of the package directory and ran:

usethis::use_pkgdown()

and then

pkgdown::build_site()

That produced the start of exactly what I wanted as a nicely pkgdown'ed site.  However, the console showed error 
messages for three examples (which, as I say, all seem to produce OK html help pages through the usual roxygen 
processing).  The error message was

   Failed to parse example for topic 

and sure enough the examples section in the pkgdown docs html was empty.  If anyone wants to look at one of
the functions, checkAllUnique was one of the three that threw the errors.

I tried some searching and the most pertinent seeming page I hit was this:

   https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown/issues/1149

where Hadley Wickham says "That's not valid .Rd code because you didn't escape the Rd comment symbol" which may
well be my problem too ... but I don't understand the advice (sorry!)

When I tried to tweak one of those functions by inserting a lot of "#" to mask results, i.e. replaced

#' [1] something

with:

#' # [1] something

(as I probably should have done that in the examples I have, they are dontrun examples so I hadn't noticed).

However, when I reran pkgdown::build_site() I got a new error message that is, to me, thoroughly confusing:

Error in utils::modifyList(meta, override) : is.list(x) is not TRUE

At that point I decided to back out and come here and ask the question in the subject line!

TIA,


Chris

In Example code, % needs to be escaped, or it will be interpreted as a 
comment.  Sometimes that means the examples just compute the wrong 
thing, e.g.

A %*% b

is parsed as A when the rest of the line is ignored as a comment. 
Sometimes it makes the code illegal.  I don't know which you're seeing.

pkgdown tries to parse \dontrun examples, so this was a good thing, but 
I think you missed some:  e.g. in checkAllUnique.Rd, I see this around 
lines 55-60:

\examples{
\dontrun{
### letters gets us the 26 lower case letters of the English alphabet so 
should test OK
checkAllUnique(letters)
[1] TRUE
### good!

That line containing TRUE is not legal R code, so should be commented. 
You can find these one by one by copying the text from the Rd example 
section into a file, and trying to parse that file, e.g.

Put this in "test.R":

   ### letters gets us the 26 lower case letters of the English alphabet 
so should test OK
   checkAllUnique(letters)
   [1] TRUE
   ### good!

then run parse("test.R"):

Error in parse("test.R") : test.R:3:1: unexpected '['
2: checkAllUnique(letters)
3: [
    ^

You can do it for a file at a time by loading the test.R file into 
RStudio; it'll put markers beside each syntax error.  Unfortunately, it 
thinks

checkAllUnique(tmpTib \%>\% pull(1))

is a syntax error:  those escapes are required in Rd, but are illegal in R.

I don't know if there's a way to do it directly from the Roxygen source.

Here's a better way to do the file-at-a-time check:

Load the .Rd file in RStudio, and click on Preview.  Copy the whole 
examples section to a test.R file.  RStudio will mark all the syntax 
errors, but won't be fooled by the \% escapes, since the Preview handled 
them.

Brilliant: exactly what I needed.  I see a happy hour tomorrow morning sorting those.

Many thanks (again) Duncan and very best to all here!

Just a quick follow-up on this to have a clarification in the thread.  Duncan's suggestions put me straight 
but it seems that at least in my current set up (Rstudio 1.4.1103, R 4.0.5 on Ubuntu 20.04) the preview 
of the Rd file doesn't remove the "\" escapes if I put them into the Roxygen code examples.  However, it also 
seems that if I leave "%>%" as is there (and sort out my other messes that Duncan pointed out!) that 
everything goes fine so I now I have very pleasing (at least to me!) pkgdown site for my package at
https://cecpfuns.psyctc.org.  

At times the learning curve involved in developing the package has seemed tough but, with help from this list,
it is really starting to feel useful, and I'm sure that it was absolutely the right thing to do.

Very best all,

Chris

You need to let us see the message about the submission failure if you 
want us to give you advice about it.

Could it be that "-lcrypt32" is missing in the compile command?
If so, how can I conditionally include it for Windows 32-bit builds?

Dear all,


The package I've tried to submit uses HTSlib, which in turn uses libcurl.  >From the build logs, I think there is a version mismatch, or configuration problem with libcurl:

https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/USCDtools_0.0.1_20210409_093124/Windows/00install.out

The problem seems to boil down to:
<https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/USCDtools_0.0.1_20210409_093124/Windows/00install.out>

undefined reference to `_imp__CertEnumCertificatesInStore at 8'

Can I do anything about it in my package?

Kind regards,
Roel Janssen

Message-ID: <CAGjgynZRG1CYjcGXQF=c1rh=4z59SrQwTRU5caU2+P+x5BD9TA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I just started a submission to CRAN, but got the following WARNING from
win-builder:

Found the following significant warnings: init.c:1: warning: ISO C forbids
an empty translation unit [-Wpedantic]

To the best of my knowledge, -pedantic is a recommended compilation flag
for C++ and relates to the use of strict ISO C++ code. However, the file
pointed (init.c) is not a file I have written, and do not know exactly
where this comes from, or how to fix it. Package uses C++ code and Rcpp,
but nothing like a configure or Makevars is included.

This warning does not appear when  R CMD check --as-cran is run in my home
Linux (Ubuntu 20.04).

Is this a big issue? does anybody have an idea on how to prevent it?

Thank you,
Eugenio

Hello all,

I have a fairly simple package I want to make. It takes two dataframes and then creates a jpeg (a heat map) based on the info in the dataframes.

I know how to put the code in the vignette.
But as to how to make an example, I don't know that. Would I put the code in the R code for the heat map?

How can I do this, it seems very foggy to me.

Thanks, Matthew

Hi Matthew,

see the notes on examples in function documentations here:
https://r-pkgs.org/man.html#man-functions
if you use the Roxygen setup (which I recommend)
or the corresponding info in WRE:
https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#Writing-R-documentation-files

Regards,
Berry

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] how to provide an example for my package when I want to generate a figure

Hello all,

I have a fairly simple package I want to make. It takes two dataframes and then creates a jpeg (a heat map) based on the info in the dataframes.

I know how to put the code in the vignette.
But as to how to make an example, I don't know that. Would I put the code in the R code for the heat map?

How can I do this, it seems very foggy to me.

Thanks, Matthew

Hello R package developers,

I tried sending in my package for the fifth time or so, but it still says that it has errors. I read the error messages but I cannot figure out what the error could be. Does anyone know?

Thanks, Matthew

You need to figure out why it does not install.

RHub (http://builder.r-hub.io/) may help if you do not have a suitable
machine nearby.

Dear all,
I am having the following warning when loading my rpackage:

true to my DESCRIPTION file.
Any ideas?
Thank you in advance,

Have you already tried also setting LazyDataCompression as the warning
suggests?

You should try all of bzip2, xz and gzip in turn and look at the size of
the installed lazy-loading database to find the best compression format.
The development version of the WRE manual at

https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-devel/R-exts.html#Data-in-packages

gives a function CheckLazyDataCompression, which can be used to do that.

Best regards,

	Sebastian

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Problem with S4 method for plotting a raster file
Message-ID: <A39314C5-E914-464E-AC54-CC93CC25CE0A@bios.au.dk>

Dear all,

I have just discovered an error in a package that I have already uploaded to
CRAN, and cannot figure out how to fix it. All help will be greatly appreciated.
The package is called DEPONS2R, and is available from:
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DEPONS2R/index.html

The problem is related to one of the included examples, where I plot the coastline
on top of a raster file. In the example, where the plotting is embedded in
an S4 method called plot.DeponsRaster, the coastline does not show. But if
I run the functions that the method is composed of, everything works fine (see
below). So I am wondering if the graphics devise is not passed on correctly
within the package, or what actually happens.

The example that does not run correctly is available from ?plot.DeponsRaster:

library(DEPONS2R)

data("bathymetry")
plot(bathymetry)
data("coastline")
library(rgdal)
# Change projection of coastline to match that of bathymetry data
coastline2 <- spTransform(coastline, crs(bathymetry))
plot(coastline2, add=TRUE, col="lightyellow2")


Here the coastline is not plotted. The method is defined as:


setMethod("plot", signature("DeponsRaster", "ANY"),
          function(x, y, maxpixels=500000, col, alpha=NULL, colNA=NA, add=FALSE,
                   ext=NULL, useRaster=TRUE, interpolate=FALSE, addfun=NULL,
                   nc, nr, maxnl=16, main, npretty=0, axes=TRUE,
                   legend=TRUE, trackToPlot=1, ...)  {
            oldpar <- graphics::par(no.readonly = TRUE)
            on.exit(graphics::par(oldpar))
            if (missing(main)) {
              main <- paste(x at landscape, x at type, sep=" - ")
            }
            # Define colours specific or 'type'
            if(missing(col) && x at type=="bathymetry") {
              tmp.col <- grDevices::rainbow(1000)[501:800]
              col <- c(tmp.col[1:100], rep(tmp.col[101:250], each=5))
            }
            # Use {raster}-package for plotting
            if(x at crs=="NA") {
              crs2 <- sp::CRS(as.character(NA))
            } else {
              crs2 <- sp::CRS(x at crs)
            }
            rdata <- raster::raster(x=x at data, xmn=x at ext$xleft, xmx=x at ext$xright,
                                    ymn=x at ext$ybottom, ymx=x at ext$ytop,
                                    crs=crs2)
            raster::plot(rdata, col=col, main=main,
                         alpha=alpha, add=add, ext=ext, axes=axes, legend=legend)
          }
)


But when I use the functions that are at the core of this method it is
not a problem adding the coastline correctly:

x <- bathymetry
crs2 <- raster::crs(x at crs)
rdata <- raster::raster(x = x at data, xmn = x at ext$xleft,
xmx = x at ext$xright, ymn = x at ext$ybottom, ymx = x at ext$ytop,
crs = crs2)
raster::plot(rdata)
plot(coastline2, add=TRUE, col="lightyellow2")

If would be fantastic if someone can figure out how I should modify the method
to plot the coastline correctly on top of the map.


Best regards,
Jacob

I'm not sure exactly what is going wrong, but if you plot the coastline 
first and the bathymetry second, things do show up.  Maybe that's enough 
of a hint for you:

library(DEPONS2R)
data("coastline")
library(rgdal)
coastline2 <- spTransform(coastline, crs(bathymetry))
plot(coastline2, col="lightyellow2")

data("bathymetry")
plot(bathymetry, add=TRUE)

This puts the legend on top of the plotted coastline data, so my guess 
is that the limits of the bathymetry plot aren't being made available to 
the coastline plot when you do things in the original order.

The inclusion of 'library(rgdal)' above suggests that your plot method needs something from 'rgdal'. If that something is a plot method from that package, it may not be visible from your function (due to changes introduced in R-4.0.0, search NEWS for R-4.0.0 'plot'), you would need to import plot methods from rgdal if that is the case (and maybe move rgdal from Suggests to Imports).

Hi Duncan

Thanks a lot for the help. This works, but unfortunately it does not result in a landscape which is cropped to the extent of the bathymetry raster file... it would be nice to be able to do that as well (as you can if you use the 'raster' and 'sp' packages).

Best wishes,
Jacob

The example that does not run correctly is available from ?plot.DeponsRaster:
library(DEPONS2R)

library(rgdal)
# Change projection of coastline to match that of bathymetry data
coastline2 <- spTransform(coastline, crs(bathymetry))

Here the coastline is not plotted. The method is defined as:

                         alpha=alpha, add=add, ext=ext, axes=axes, legend=legend)
          }
)
But when I use the functions that are at the core of this method it is

crs2 <- raster::crs(x at crs)

Dear Georgi

Thanks a lot for the suggestion. I have now imported rgdal and moved it from Suggests of Imports. However, this did not solve my problem.
I also tried importing 'plot' directly from rgdal, but then I got the error: object ?plot? is not exported by 'namespace:rgdal'

Best,
Jacob

I wasn't suggesting that my code was a solution, it's just a hint about 
what is going wrong.  I don't know how the coastline plot determines the 
bounds of the plot region, but if that isn't working, then you'd have 
problems similar to what you saw.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Question "no visible binding for '<<-' assignment"
Message-ID: <CANTQg_dx-Nih4UWXzhVHdySjsXKZ_kFdc51k69V79fVxKfDY3w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi :)

I'm here because i have a problem with my package...i have the function
"SARMAX.refinement", clearly the problem is that i can't assign a variable
on global environment from a function.
So when i CHECK the package it gives me 1 Note that doesn't make me publish
the package :(

The Note is this:

* checking R code for possible problems ... [20s] NOTE
SARMAX.refinement: no visible binding for '<<-' assignment to 'xreg'


The fact is that the function
"model <- Arima(fit$data, order = arima_order,seasonal =
list(order=seasonal_order,period=period), xreg = xreg)"

works only if i define xreg on the glob.env...

I tried  using fitted(fit) instead of xreg but i cannot use predict because
the function doesn't find "fitted(fit)" or xreg (even if i define xreg only
inside the function with xreg <- fitted(fit)).

Anyone has any suggestions?
(without completely change the function or the class...i'd like to
maintain the current class to use all its functions)

Thank you,
Federico



P.S.

In order to being as clear as possible i paste the code i need to use:

arimaGGM <- SARMAX.refinement(GGM,arima_order = c(2,0,1),seasonal_order =
c(1,0,0), period=4,display = F)
predict(arimaGGM,newxreg = 1:100)

the data is also attached to the mail :)

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Another newbie question: vignettes not appearing in
 GitHub hosted package
Message-ID: <2073689205.1245013.1618419190285.JavaMail.zimbra@psyctc.org>

As ever, my package is https://github.com/cpsyctc/CECPfuns and I am building withing Rstudio 1.4.1103 

I am aiming for the package to have fairly comprehensive vignettes and there are four now, but two are very incomplete. 

The problem I have may relate to https://github.com/Kenkleinman/clusterPower/issues/113 and to 
https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/issues/1766 or it may not. I have a nasty feeling that I am just looking 
straight through something obvious. 

When I run 
browseVignettes(package = "CECPfuns") 
within Rstudio working on the package I see the vignettes and I have now got pkgdown working to compile the 
lovely web site around the package (at https://cecpfuns.psyctc.org/) and I see the vignettes there and they 
update. 

The bizarre thing that is beating me is that when I pull the package down to any machine with 
remotes::install_github("cpsyctc/CECPfuns") 
gets the function but no vignettes! Here's an example from my little Pi machine:

Hi Chris,

You need to add the `build_vignettes = TRUE` argument to `install_github()`.

remotes::install_github() does not build the vignettes by default, you
can use the build_opts argument to change this.

Oh no, how embarrassing!  

But in my defence, am I the only one who thinks having build_vignettes = FALSE as default is a bit anti-vignettes?!

Many thanks both,

remotes::install_github() is a function aimed at developers that need
the unreleased version of a package for testing or other dev purposes.
In these cases you don't usually need the vignettes. hence the
default.

Then something is broken.  You need to change things: packages shouldn't 
be writing directly to the global environment.

I don't know the Arima function, but it's where I'd start looking.

Scoping for modelling functions is quite tricky.  The standard rules are 
that model variables are looked for in the data argument first, then the 
environment of the model formula.  "Model variables" include those 
referenced in the model formula, but also some others.

No, it wasn't.  If you want more specific help, you should include a 
self-contained example in the text of your message.

Vignettes are not built by default when using remotes::install_github, request it explicitly:

remotes::install_github("cpsyctc/CECPfuns", build_vignettes = TRUE)

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Another newbie question: vignettes not appearing in GitHub hosted package

As ever, my package is https://github.com/cpsyctc/CECPfuns and I am building withing Rstudio 1.4.1103 

I am aiming for the package to have fairly comprehensive vignettes and there are four now, but two are very incomplete. 

The problem I have may relate to https://github.com/Kenkleinman/clusterPower/issues/113 and to
https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/issues/1766 or it may not. I have a nasty feeling that I am just looking straight through something obvious. 

When I run
browseVignettes(package = "CECPfuns")
within Rstudio working on the package I see the vignettes and I have now got pkgdown working to compile the lovely web site around the package (at https://cecpfuns.psyctc.org/) and I see the vignettes there and they update. 

The bizarre thing that is beating me is that when I pull the package down to any machine with
remotes::install_github("cpsyctc/CECPfuns")
gets the function but no vignettes! Here's an example from my little Pi machine: 

> remotes::install_github("cpsyctc/CECPfuns")

Thanks G?bor, Zhian, Georgi,

Clearly I should read the help pages more carefully!  I guess I had come to see GitHub less as a developer resource
and more as a subsidiary repository for people whose packages wouldn't meet CRAN standards (hey ho, perhaps one day!)
So I had assumed that when you install from there you get everything: clearly not the case and now I do see the logic.

Thanks to all. This list is wonderful!!

Chris

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Problems with too much testing
Message-ID: <1df17415-0a48-a1a2-6498-6af12419f346@gmail.com>

I'm updating the rgl package, and have come across the following problem.

Some packages that depend on rgl and do careful testing are detecting 
inconsequential changes.  A typical case is the nat package, which has 
extensive testing, some of which comes down to checking results from rgl 
functions using testthat::is_equal().  I rewrote some parts of the rgl 
code, and so some rgl objects differ in irrelevant ways.  For example,

   obj <- list(x = NULL)

differs from

   obj <- list()
   obj[["x"]] <- NULL

(the first is length 1, the second ends up with no entries).  All tests 
in rgl would be like

   if (is.null(obj[["x"]])) ...

so the tests evaluate the same, but testthat::is_equal() doesn't return 
TRUE, because the objects are different.

Another example would be

   obj <- list()
   obj$a <- 1
   obj$b <- 2

which differs from

   obj <- list()
   obj$b <- 2
   obj$a <- 1

in the order of the components, but since rgl always accessed them by 
name, that makes no difference.

So what I'm looking for is a strategy to hide internal implementation 
details.  (I'm using a compare_proxy() method now which standardizes the 
objects, but that seems very specific to testthat version 3.  I'd like 
ideas for something more robust.)

An all.equal method?? This might not work with 3rd edition though
(untested), and I'm not sure what method registration requirements
would exist for the user.

Best,

Message-ID: <CAF4cKStcm42=Mz+hCj-KOLLXFeo62MtAgKPfkag_cAjrkXkuLQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

We publish in CRAN our package rTLS [1]. The package passed the test
without problems. However, at some point, additional testing suggests that
it has issues with 'gcc-ASAN' [2]. For me this error is not informative,
and thus, I do not have an idea how to start. I have been looking for
guides or help on the web and unsure of this issue's reason or meaning. It
is not clear to me what to do based on Writing R Extensions in section
4.3.3.

When I see the log files [2], the issue seems to be located in a specific
function. However, not sure why this is in a specific function since the
based code is also shared with other functions.

Can you guide me or help me with this? I know that my message is not so
informative, but I do not know how to start to ask about this issue. Here
is the code development repository for this package [3].
Antonio,

My 2c is that if a package has actually tested something like that
(say, the ordering of a list's elements), then it is 100% likely that
a script out there depends on that behaviour too.  In other words, the
change is not inconsequential.  R users are in debt to package
developers but I think it behoves us to take special care not to
underestimate the work involved when a package's behaviour changes.

It already has one, but it isn't used by testthat 3.

I suspect this test is not intentional, and it really wouldn't make 
sense for a package to depend on the order of named list components.

There's a difference between internal implementation changes and 
external behaviour changes.  For example, there are clear warnings not 
to use un-exported functions (via :::), and a package that did that 
would not be accepted on CRAN.

What I'm asking for are suggestions for ways to hide internal layouts of 
objects from users.  That seems a lot harder.

You could randomise the order?.

An offline message said

"Oh, you mean you're asking for an actual object-oriented language that
hides the internal representations of objects from users of a package.
Unfortunately for all of us, that isn't R....."

Actually, I don't think that's what I want.  We already have lots of 
languages like that (and it's not too hard to integrate C++ with R, for 
example), but I'm not tempted to move code from R to C++ unnecessarily: 
  there's too much mental overhead (for me) in handling the extra formality.

What I think I'd like is something closer to the :: versus ::: 
difference in R.  In practice, it's purely a convention that ::: isn't 
used.  The package writer declares (via the NAMESPACE) that certain 
functions are fair game and will tend to be stable over time, but can't 
block access to the internal functions that aren't:  users are free to 
take chances and use :::.

I'd like to be able to declare that the order of components in a list 
doesn't matter.  I think the NULL component versus missing component is 
basically a bug in the language, but it's such an old one that I don't 
think it could be changed:  so I'd like to be able to declare that it's 
not a distinction anyone should depend on.

Both of these things could easily be handled by the existing S3 
machinery.  Instead of declaring my object to have class "mesh3d", I 
could declare it to have class c("mesh3d", "unorderedList", 
"ignoreNULL"), and comparison methods like base::all.equal() or 
waldo::compare() would ignore the unimportant differences.

The hardest thing here would be to agree on the class names and what 
they imply.

Another approach is to change the responsibility.

My feeling is that tests in the TESTING package should be modifiable by the maintainer of
the TESTED package, with both packages suspended if the two maintainers cannot agree. We
need to be able to move forward when legacy behaviour is outdated or just plain wrong. Or,
in the case that I find affects me, when improvements in iterative schemes change iterates
slightly. My guess is that Duncan's example is a case in point.

I doubt this will ever occur, as it doesn't seem to be the R way. However, I do know that
improvements in methods are not going to CRAN in some cases.

In the cases I've been involved with the authors of the testing package 
have accepted suggested changes when I've made them:  I think that's 
also part of "the R way".  However, this takes time for both of us:  I 
need to understand what they are intending to test before I can suggest 
a change to it, and they need to understand my change before they can 
decide if it is acceptable, or whether further changes would also be 
necessary.

Github helps a lot with this:  if the testing package is there, I can 
quickly reproduce the issue, produce a fix, and send it to the author, 
who can tweak it if I've set things up properly.

For the kinds of changes you're making, I suspect relaxing a tolerance 
would often be enough, though if you switch algorithms and record that 
in your results, the testing package may need to replace reference 
values.  I think I'd be uncomfortable doing that.

I'm generally in accord with Duncan on this. There are inevitably situations where general
rules don't apply. Our challenge is to find practical ways to keep the overall workload of
all participants in the process to a minimum.

One of the basic principles of testing is "test interface, not
implementation."  Tests that violate this principle become "change detector
tests" instead of "correctness tests" and essentially prevent any
improvements to the code.  In C++ objects have "public" and "private"
methods, and the testing diktat is to test the public ones.  I hit this
issue a lot at Google when internal clients wrote change detector tests
effectively fencing in my tools.  My solution was to point out the
problematic tests and ask them not to do that.

The intent of R as a language is to be fast, lightweight, and flexible.  In
the interest of keeping it that way for users, it has grown large and
cumbersome for package authors.  If we try to tack on a "public/private"
object layout I'm afraid that would be yet another burden on package
authors.  The most obvious place I see to do this is in the NAMESPACE file,
which is already an ugly beast.  So while I agree with Duncan's
characterization of the problem, to my ears the "social solution" is the
cleanest one available, if we're talking about formal mechanisms.

Informally, both C++ and python use underscores in variable names to
suggest private data members.  You could just prefix "PRIVATE" to the name
of all the data members you don't want tested, where "PRIVATE" might become
"." or "_", or some other character.  I would argue against using
underscores, but I think I've already lost that battle.

Message-ID: <CAF4cKSs+wMyC4=16jPN7WoYv5zAqQV+D9XDLwQtVoJYS6pFxKw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

We publish in CRAN our package rTLS [1]. The package passed the test
without problems. However, at some point, additional testing suggests that
it has issues with 'gcc-ASAN' [2]. For me this error is not informative,
and thus, I do not have an idea how to start. I have been looking for
guides or help on the web and unsure of this issue's reason or meaning. It
is not clear to me what to do based on Writing R Extensions in section
4.3.3.

When I see the log files [2], the issue seems to be located in a specific
function. However, not sure why this is in a specific function since the
based code is also shared with other functions.

Can you guide me or help me with this? I know that my message is not so
informative, but I do not know how to start to ask about this issue or
reproduce the error. Here is the code development repository for this
package [3].

Antonio,

>From https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/bdr/memtests/gcc-ASAN/rTLS/00check.log,
you can see errors of the form:

==3566104==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: stack-use-after-scope on address
0x7fffc2651f80 at pc 0x7f7ba5b635de bp 0x7fffc2651eb0 sp

The slides here explain what that means in more detail:
https://llvm.org/devmtg/2016-11/Slides/Buka-StackUseAfterScope.pdf

But, in short, it usually means you took a reference to a variable on
the stack, and then tried to access memory via that reference after
that variable went out-of-scope.

Based on the associated code here:

https://github.com/Antguz/rTLS/blob/449b5c98942a37d4d98d4d2d27ac04caf3cc2cb6/src/knn_rcpp.cpp#L20-L48

A guess is that the issue is related to your use of the non-copying
arma::mat constructors + attempts to transpose them. Could you use
.inplace_trans() instead?

You can also try to verify locally using e.g. Docker; the rocker
images here are immensely helpful:

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Package fails to build on CRAN Windows server:
 rtracklayer version too new
Message-ID: <CAKT0KkevvP-7Z1oLbZNtYryzeh=zqNocNAxVUbEzqjnUOuGnoA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am trying to submit an update to my package
(https://cran.r-project.org/package=Signac) to CRAN, but it is
currently failing to install on the Windows server. I see the
following installation error: "namespace 'rtracklayer' 1.48.0 is being
loaded, but >= 1.51.5 is required."

The current release version for rtracklayer is 1.50.0
(https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/rtracklayer.html).
My package does not set a version requirement for rtracklayer, so this
installation error must be caused by having a pre-release version of
one of my bioconductor dependencies installed on the windows server.

Does anyone know how I might be able to solve this issue? I have tried
contacting the CRAN team a few times by reply-all to the CRAN emails,
but have not had any response from them. This seems like an issue that
could only be solved by fixing the installation of packages on the
CRAN Windows server.

Incoming test results:
https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/Signac_1.1.2_20210415_225235/

Thanks,
Tim

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Does a file in tests/ know which package it is being

Message-ID: <24698.6223.179670.434248@rob.eddelbuettel.com>


When a script in tests/ is being run by R CMD check and friends, can we know
what package it is currently being part of?  I want to access some package
files via system.file(..., package=pkg) which works just fine, but it feels
redundant to assign the package name to the pkg variable.  

Case in point is that I once again forgot to update the inst/NEWS.Rd file for
an upload today.  As I use a structured format, I can fairly reliably extract
the most recent version therein, and DESCRIPTION has the current version. So
what follows works fine , but per the preceding paragraph, do I need really
need 'pkg <- "RcppAPT"' here or can I do better?

Thanks for any pointers,  Dirk

---- tests/version.R for RcppAPT follows  -----------------------------------
pkg <- "RcppAPT"
nrdfile <- system.file("NEWS.Rd", package = pkg)
if (file.exists(nrdfile)) {
    nrd <- readLines(nrdfile)
    ver <- as.package_version(gsub(".* ([0-9\\.]+) .*", "\\1", nrd[grepl("\\{Changes", nrd)]))
    dcf <- read.dcf(system.file("DESCRIPTION", package = pkg))
    cur <- as.package_version(dcf[[1,"Version"]])
    if (cur != ver[1]) stop("Expected NEWS entry for ", cur, " but saw ", ver[1], call. = FALSE)

Hello,

Thanks for your response Kevin. It works using 'inplace_trans()', but it
takes a long time to solve.

I will try to reproduce the error using Dirk's suggestion.

Your guides are appreciated.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] compiling C sources on windows
Message-ID: <CALECgPap8LHmiFsO=eJpXGq_vR7LMvmmSuuGbO_a8XZYK5VLSA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear List -

I'm working to get a package of mine that was archived last year back on to
CRAN.
The epanet2toolkit provides an R interface to the EPANET simulation engine
that is written in C.

The latest development version of the package builds and checks ok on mac
and linux but fails to
compile and install on windows with a bunch of errors like:

undefined reference to `_imp__*`

where * is some function defined in a header file and implemented in the
corresponding source file.

Am i missing a compiler flag or something?

Current output from winbuilder :
https://win-builder.r-project.org/9aIcl8Fxu7w1/00install.out
or https://pastebin.com/8JQNpNKp

source code: https://github.com/bradleyjeck/epanet2toolkit/tree/v22dev

Any insights appreciated.

Brad

I suspect the cause is this:

https://github.com/bradleyjeck/epanet2toolkit/blob/aa698568ab85db133f8634928e8cfe661b41ed57/src/epanet2.h#L42-L61

Usually, you only need to explicitly use __declspec if you're
compiling with MSVC -- it shouldn't be necessary when using a MinGW
toolchain (as R's toolchain is). You could try adding something like:

#ifdef __MINGW32__
#define DLLEXPORT
#endif

If you need to test locally on Windows, there are free virtual
machines available here:

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Package fails to build on CRAN Windows server:
 rtracklayer version too new
In-Reply-To: <CAKT0KkevvP-7Z1oLbZNtYryzeh=zqNocNAxVUbEzqjnUOuGnoA@mail.gmail.com>

Message-ID: <CAFDcVCQ3QT=5sYqVa_giaBzsonyEni8MdwqfuSutt_r9Z5hCQA@mail.gmail.com>

Not that it solves your problem per se, but here's what I think CRAN
only has rtracklayer 1.48.0 installed on WIndows, i.e. why you get
error "namespace 'rtracklayer' 1.48.0 is being loaded, but >= 1.51.5
is required.":

* The current Bioconductor "release" is version 3.12
* As you say, Bioconductor 3.12 provides rtracklayer 1.50.0
(https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/3.12/bioc/html/rtracklayer.html)
* However, if you look at that page, for Windows it only provides
rtracklayer 1.49.5 (this is because rtracklayer never successfully
checked on Bioconductor 3.12)
* Since the minor version component of rtracklayer 1.49.5 is _odd_, it
means it's from a Bioconductor 'devel' branch, i.e. when Bioconductor
3.12 was in devel.
* Thus, the most recent Bioconductor "release" where rtracklayer was
successfully distributed on Windows is Bioconductor 3.11.
* Bioconductor 3.11 provides rtracklayer 1.48.0
(https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/3.11/bioc/html/rtracklayer.html)

Clear as mud?

I suspect you're using Suggest: rtracklayer
(https://github.com/timoast/signac/blob/develop/DESCRIPTION) in your
new version.  If so, that's good.  I also don't think you're doing
anything wrong here.  Instead, I think it's one of your other
Bioconductor dependencies under 'Imports:', or possibly under
'Suggests:', that depend on 'rtracklayer'.  The fact that error says
"namespace 'rtracklayer' 1.48.0 is being loaded, but >= 1.51.5 is
required.", means that one of those Bioconductor dependencies, or
their dependencies, has an explicit 'rtracklayer (>= 1.51.5)' under
either Depends: or Imports:.  My recommendation is that you start
identifying that Bioconductor package, and in what way your 'Signac'
depends on that package.  That will help you decide on what to do
next.

/Henrik

PS. This can happen because Bioconductor allows a package to propagate
to a new "release" branch even if it fails on one of the operating
systems.

Hi packagers,

what is the best way to skip certain tests on CRAN?  So far I have included
certain test files in .Rbuildignore and run the tests on the package
directory.  But now when moving to Authors at R format, I get errors about
missing maintainer etc.

I know there are options in testthat, tinytest and such, are these the best
options with least dependencies and assumptions built in?

I sort of remember something in base R but cannot find anything when
looking for it now.

Cheers,
Ott

Hi Ott,

There is no documented way to detect whether you are running on CRAN. So
there is nothing to rely on, on that side.

You can only make your own machine detectable by the test code. For example
by setting an environment variable that identifies your machine and make
test execution depend on the value of that environment variable. This is
what tinytest does under the hood.

Best,
Mark

That probably means you have an "articles:" section in your _pkgdown.yml

The base solution is to put your local-only tests in another directory, 
and specify it using "--test-dir=".  One of the scripts there can run 
the files in the regular tests directory, so you get both sets with that 
option, but CRAN will only run the regular ones.

You could add the following at the start of a script containing slow tests:

if (!identical(Sys.getenv("NOT_CRAN"), "true")) {
    message("skipping slow tests")
    q("no")
}
## slow tests follow here ...

Of course, you could use a different name for the environment variable,
e.g., "R_PKGNAME_ALL_TESTS", or test with as.logical() to allow both
"TRUE" and "true" values:

if (!isTRUE(as.logical(Sys.getenv("R_PKGNAME_ALL_TESTS")))) q("no")

Quitting from test scripts as above is frequently used in R's own test
suite, for example in the regression tests for message translations:

if (!capabilities("NLS")) {
    message("no natural language support")
    q("no")
}

Don't run such code in an interactive session if you don't want to quit
R. ;)

An alternative is the R CMD check --test-dir=inst/slowTests approach
mentioned in the WRE manual at
https://CRAN.R-project.org/doc/manuals/r-devel/R-exts.html#Checking-packages
.

Best regards,

You can default to have 'few tests'. That then happens at CRAN too when
nothing else is set (as there simply is no variable to rely upon).

You can then try to detect when you would want to run 'more tests'. Placing
the tests somewhere else (as Duncan suggested) to explicitly opt in is one
way (though you may forget to opt in...), making it depend on an extra
variable you set for more tests is another (though you may forget to set
this).

So like to automate this via a 'testable condition' in the loader script in
tests/ that sets that environment variable for me. E.g. in Rcpp _if_ it sees
a version number such as 1.0.6.6 which signals (via the fourth component)
that this is a 'development / interim' version it sets the controlling
environment variable run 'full / all tests'. Whereas at CRAN, the next
release will be 1.0.7, which is a release version and only the (default) few
tests run.

Hope this helps, Dirk

You cannot do anything, this note is fine and a CRAN team member can 
install the package if needed.

Thanks everyone!

I'd like to follow the Duncan's approach but I am not sure if it solves the
issue:
* if I put the private tests into a separate folder and ignore it when
building the package, then I still cannot run these checks without creating
the tarball (Maintainer, Author not built into DESCRIPTION)
* If I do not ignore this folder and build it into a tarball, then both
private and public tests work, but now check-as-cran complains about
non-standard directories.

I do not see an option like --do-not-test-description which would skip the
issues with authors and maintainers.  Obviously, I can replicate authors
both in @R and plain format but then again, what is the point of @R format?

So for now I'll probably go with the Dirk's suggestion to default to "few
tests" and set up an environment variable just for myself.

BTW, Mark, I really like your tinytest vignettes :-)  I should maybe move
my tests over to this one day.

Best,
Ott

Hi,

I'm trying to help clean up an R package for someone else to submit to 
CRAN. He has used ggplot2 to implement a plotting function for the kinds 
of things that his packages generates. His plotting routine basically 
looks like (after changing names to protect the innocent):

myPlot <- fucntion(myData, ...) {
 ?? # get ready
 ?? ggplot(myData, aes(x = myX, y = myY)) +
 ????? # add my decorations
 ????? theme_bw()
}

Of course, "R CMD check --as-cran" complains that there is no global 
binding for "myX" or "myY" since they are columns defined in the 
data.frame "myData".

What is the best way to work around this issue?

Of course, dinosaurs like myself might be tempted to suggest just using 
plain old "plot", so I don't need to see those suggestions.

Do I just ignore the usual ggplot conventions and write "myData$myX" 
inside "aes"? in order to appease the CRAN checker? Or is there some 
tidy-er way to solve this problem?

Thanks,
 ? Kevin

Hi Kevin,

I was faced to the same problem and I used 'aes_string()' instead of 'aes()'. You can then just write the name of the columns containing the data to plot as character strings.

Example:

myPlot <- function(myData, ...) {
    # get ready
    ggplot(myData, aes_string(x = "myX", y = "myY")) +
       # add my decorations
       theme_bw()
}

It is probably already the case for your function but you need to include #' @import ggplot2 in your function preamble (if I am not wrong).

Kind regards
Paul

Kevin,

This vignette from ggplot2 itself gives the "officially recommended" ways
to avoid the warnings from R CMD check

You can use the globalVariables() function to tell R about them:

   utils::globalVariables(c("myX", "myY"))

Thanks.

Obviously, long. long ago, (in a galaxy not far enough away), Paul's 
suggestion of using "aes_string" was the correct one, since "aes" uses 
non-standard evaluation. (And to quote somebody from an R fortune 
cookie, "The problem with non-standard evaluation is that it is 
non-standard.") But teh documentation at the end oft he link provided by 
Robert explivityl tells you not to do that, since "aes_string is 
deprecated".? And reading more carefully into the manual page for 
aes_string, one does indeed find the statement that the function is 
"soft deprecated". I'm not sure what that means, other than someone on 
the development team doesn't like it.

Instead, the vignette says you should
 ?? importFrom("rlang", ".data")
in your NAMESPACE, and write
 ?? ggplot(myData, aes(x = .data$myX, y = .data$myY))

And now my dinosaur question: That looks like using one non-standard 
hack to cover up the problems with another non-standard hack. Why the 
heck? is that any better for the developer than writing
 ?? ggplot(myData, aes(x = myData$myX, y = myData$myY))

or using Dirk Eddelbuettel's suggestion of calling utils::globalVariables ??

It's time to tell those kids to get off of my lawn.

   For some reason that I don't remember, an R core member once told me 
that they prefer x <- y <- NULL to utils::globalVariables(c("x","y")) - 
although I have also encountered problems with that strategy in edge cases.

  Here's an example from StackOverflow from today where for some reason 
I don't understand, evaluation of function arguments interacts with 
non-standard/lazy evaluation within a dplyr function such that 'foo' 
works while 'x$foo' doesn't ... don't know if it's a similar case.

Well, for one, because it does not always work, see e.g. the examples
and links here:
https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/issues/2693

> or using Dirk Eddelbuettel's suggestion of calling utils::globalVariables ??

Because if you refer to a hundred different columns in your plots, then
you'll need to add all of them to globalVariables(), and this is error prone
and cumbersome to update. If you only refer a handful of columns, then sure,
this will work as well.

Hi Kevin,

I recently developed a plot function in a package that used ggplot and ran into the same problem.  I overcame the problem with a first line of (useless) code as

myX <- myY <- NULL

I found the solution inelegant but it worked.

cheers!
Mike

Hi everyone,
One suggestion would be import ggplot2 and using tidy eval operators to
create a function. One simple reproducible example would be

library(ggplot2)
my_hist <- function(df, var){
  ggplot(df, aes({{var}})) +
    geom_histogram()
}

df <- data.frame(my_var = rnorm(400, 10, 2))
my_hist(df = df, var = my_var)

All the best
Tiago

Hi Henrik,

Thanks for your explanation, that does indeed make sense. I will try
to track down the bioc package dependency that's setting the explicit
rtracklayer version dependency and go from there...

The fact that Bioconductor allows packages to be released without
successfully building on Windows does create some interesting
downstream issues for CRAN packages with bioc dependencies, and raises
a larger question for me about whether I should really host this
package on CRAN or if I should try to move it to Bioconductor.

Anyway, thanks again for your help (also I'm a big fan of your future package)

Cheers,
Tim

That could have been me.  Even though I think I still have some
globalVariables() statements in some of my package sources, I've
decided that it *harms* really, notably for relatively common variable names such
as "x":   It declares them "global"
{ for the purpose of codetools::globalVariables() } everywhere,
i.e. for all functions in the package namespace and that
basically kills the reliability of  globalVariables() checking
for the whole package.

Has there been any thought given to an alternative to globalVariables that
would flag certain arguments to certain functions as being evaluated in a
non-standard way.  E.g.,
    usesNSE(FUN="with.default", ARGUMENTS="expr")
    usesNSE(FUN="lm", ARGUMENTS=c("weights","subset","offset"))
    usesNSE(FUN="~") # missing ARGUMENTS means all args are NSE
This information would be stored in the environment that contains FUN.

   It seems that what we need is really ignoreLocalVariables() rather 
than globalVariables() ... ?

   Honestly, I don't remember. Something with order of evaluation and 
the fact that a variable existed and was set to NULL in the package 
namespace screwing things up.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] winUCRT failures
Message-ID: <e978e10f-c1db-6f86-fcde-1c2316f9de02@gmail.com>

The current CRAN release of rgl fails on winUCRT because of missing 
dependencies:

'htmlwidgets', 'htmltools', 'knitr', 'jsonlite', 'shiny', 'magrittr', 
'crosstalk', 'manipulateWidget'.

Tracing `htmlwidgets` shows it also fails because of missing dependencies:

'htmltools', 'jsonlite', 'yaml'

and 'htmltools' fails because of missing dependencies

'digest', 'base64enc', 'rlang'

but 'digest' only gets a warning (congratulations, Dirk!), 'base64enc' 
gets a NOTE (hurray Simon!).  'rlang' is failing a test because of a 
missing suggested dependency on 'glue'.  At that point I stopped searching.

Does anyone have a list of packages that actually need fixes?  I'd like 
to help those maintainers with the necessary updates.

The CRAN check errors (all unique to {targets} version 0.4.1) are at
https://cran-archive.r-project.org/web/checks/2021/2021-04-25_check_results_targets.html,
and I have been unable to reproduce them. I tried a fresh installation of R
4.0.2 and packages on my own Intel Mac, as well as GitHub Actions and both
Mac builds at https://builder.r-hub.io/. All those checks pass.

The error is somehow related to a very simple internal R6 class:
https://github.com/ropensci/targets/blob/4deba948b8d6ecf82511a5a58b1eb9a0addcf2bd/R/class_config.R.
The elusive failing tests are ostensibly in
https://github.com/ropensci/targets/blob/4deba948b8d6ecf82511a5a58b1eb9a0addcf2bd/tests/testthat/test-class_config.R,
but they always pass for me.

I still haven't found any of the packages at the very root of this 
cascade of errors, but I've submitted patches to rlang, glue, and 
magrittr that should allow them to have less severe check issues even if 
some of their suggested dependencies are missing.

What I haven't tried to do is check any of them if *none* of the 
suggested packages is available.  Packages should still build and check 
without ERRORs in this case, though I'd expect NOTEs and/or WARNINGs.

This is an old issue:  what packages should be present during CRAN 
checks?  Currently CRAN tries to check with everything present; perhaps 
it should also try to check with the minimal set.

I last wrote about that four years ago under the title "Suggests != Depends"
http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/blog/2017/03/22#suggests_is_not_depends

Of course, nothing changed.

So when helping a R Core member last weekend by checking his package against
just over 1000 reverse dependencies, I again had to manually wade through
dozens of false errors of packages failing tests when packages they did NOT
declare a dependency on were used unconditionally. That is still a very clear
error to me, but I no longer expect these windmills will ever stop turning.

On reflection, I strongly suspect the errors come from the way I was using
file modification time stamps to manage a user-side configuration file.
{targets} was using a time stamp to decide whether it needs to read the
file, but the precision of time stamps varies from system to system. I
implemented a workaround that avoids time stamps.

I agree it's an error.  Back when we had one of those discussions it 
seemed too resource-intensive to do both kinds of tests, and it's much 
easier to do the "install everything" tests if you are always working 
with a fixed library.

Nowadays I think it's easier to run the tests on a VM that has exactly 
the packages you specify, so people have less excuse not to do that on 
their own.  I have a Github "workflow" here that does it for rgl:

https://github.com/dmurdoch/rgl/actions/workflows/R-CMD-nosoft-check.yml

BTW, I've just submitted another patch, this time for the usethis 
package, which added "Suggests: testthat" and then used testthat 
unconditionally.  That won't help any other existing packages, but if it

Sorry, "nothing changes" is too harsh. We have in the last year or two gotten
a new test or two in R CMD check. But it is still true that what should be an
error still leads to needless failure and added confusion (c.f. beginning of
this thread).  We could do better, but won't as long as it isn't enforced.

It's a bad rule.  It's causing thousands of packages to fail now, 
because testthat won't pass checks on the winUCRT system.  It's making 
the pain of winUCRT last much longer than it should, because nobody 
knows what problems exist in their own package if they can't install it 
because of missing dependencies.

For example, as I said in the first message in this thread,

A lot of those failures are ultimately caused by magrittr failing, and 
as far as I can see the only thing causing it to fail was that it used 
testthat unconditionally even though its DESCRIPTION file promised it 
would never do that.

One additional thought:

If the testing package (i.e. testthat in this case) had been available 
but other suggested packages were not, it would be worth running tests 
with just testthat present:  that might be why you called the decision 
defensible.  I'd agree with that.

However, it's still true that the fact that testthat has to be present 
to make magrittr available is a pretty serious flaw in magrittr and/or 
the CRAN processes.  Hopefully magrittr's authors are less stubborn than 
R Core/CRAN, and will make their package more resilient.

Isn't this a 0/0 problem? If there are zero failures from zero tests,
do we really want to declare that the package is ok?

I'm not interested in participating in another debate about whether or
not one should assume that suggested packages are available when
checking a package. Some time ago, we decided to install all suggested
packages when running reverse dependency checks and it has caused us
few problems (especially since linux binaries for all CRAN packages
are now readily available). Either way, isn't it easier for the
handful of experienced developers who perform many R CMD check runs to
install all suggested packages, rather than trying to get thousands of
individual package maintainers to change their behaviour?

Who is responsible for the winUCRT checks? Perhaps that person could
provide us with a list of root causes behind the testthat failures,
and we could look into resolving them.

Message-ID: <CAC5yOjiga0hf8a4GNGSLygmoHtiJQRPyiRUw4RX-_7cDrTJvOg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,

I'm developing a package with C code. My question may be naive: I have
several internal R functions that need to be called by C, but I cannot get
it to work or find a solution. It can work if I export those internal
functions in namespace, but it fails if I just want to keep them as
internal functions without exporting them. I guess I need some flags to
indicate the "internal" R internal functions? Could you please share your
thoughts on how to fix this? Much appreciated in advance!

//   set up call to R function "R_function"
    SEXP func_R;
    PROTECT(func_R=lang2(install("R_function"), func_data));

Thanks,
C

It all depends on the environment where you evaluate that expression, 
just as it would if it was R code.  You can't see internal package 
functions from the global environment, you need to evaluate them in the 
package namespace environment.

Thanks Duncan! I was advised not to export those functions in the namespace
and keep them as internals. In terms of this, could you advise what
specific changes should I make to the C code so that I can evaluate them in
a suitable environment? I tried something like
"PROTECT(func_R=lang2(install("Package:::R_function"), func_data))," but it
did not work. Sorry this may be too naive and thanks again.

That line creates the expression to evaluate, it doesn't evaluate it. 
You need to call eval() (the C function) on the result.  Here's some 
code from rgl that does something similar:

R code to initialize:

rgl.init <- function(initValue = 0, onlyNULL = FALSE, debug = 
getOption("rgl.debug", FALSE))
   .Call( rgl_init,
     initValue, onlyNULL, environment(rgl.init), debug )

The important thing here is "environment(rgl.init)", which is the 
private environment within the package.

Then in C code, save that environment:

   rglNamespace = in_namespace;

and use it later:

   result = eval(PROTECT(lang2(PROTECT(install("rglFonts")),
 
PROTECT(ScalarString(mkChar(family))))), rglNamespace);

Hi Duncan,

thanks for helping with the fixes to packages needed for this toolchain 
(and for having UTF-8 as native encoding on Windows). Fixing packages to 
properly declare their dependencies will be useful in general.

And thanks for asking about the missing dependencies, it turns out that 
the checks broke during transition of R-devel to 4.2. I've fixed my 
scripts now and if I got it right, correct results should appear in 
about 1.5 days from now. The numbers were about 10x better before this 
happened.

A number of packages will still need fixing. I can help searching the 
logs for the root issues (packages failing for other reasons than 
missing dependencies) once the results are correct again. And I can also 
make the logs downloadable in tarball etc (rather than one-by-one).

Best
Tomas

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Build fails on R-devel due to Bioconductor version
 mismatch
Message-ID: <CAOHQ5A+t7wLwNyup80DwbOfqvuxn2PkKYeQ7Nm2SPSMAzcHmHw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am the maintainer of the deepdep package. It has recently been archived
on CRAN because I did not have time to make the necessary corrections. Now
the package passes most tests and builds on most configurations, however
there is a problem on r-devel.

I'm attaching logs from builds on R-release (successful) and R-devel
(failed) from R-hub.

Here is repository of my package on GitHub:
https://github.com/DominikRafacz/deepdep

My package uses BiocManager to get a list of packages available on the
Bioconductor repository. However, the log indicates that calling the
BiocManager::available() function results in an error related to the R
version being too new for the Bioconductor version. I'm guessing this is
related to the test environment configuration, which I have no control over
(have I?).

Is there any way to resolve the versioning issue? Or should I apply version
checking to the tests and examples in my package and catch errors if
unavailable?

With regards,
Dominik Rafacz

Message-ID: <37f55142-ae2d-853b-8f66-9748ce418ee7@gmail.com>

I had been under the mistaken impression that warnings in test code 
would lead to NOTEs or WARNINGs in R CMD check, but they are ignored.

I think the only outcomes from running test code are OK or ERROR, the 
latter happening when R exits with a non-zero status, as it does by 
default when there's a call to stop() in the test code.

Am I wrong about this?  Is there a way to put something executable in 
the test script that will generate a WARNING in R CMD check when executed?

The closest I can seem to get is to include *.Rout.save, which generates 
a NOTE if it doesn't match, and is fairly inconvenient to keep up to date.

Oops, wrong again.  It's a message in the check log, but it leaves the 
status as OK.

I think part of the problem is that the corresponding section in "Writing R
extensions" is not very clear for newcomers.  I admit I have read it
several times as I have been confused about the difference between suggest,
imports and depends, and so combed section 1.1.3 repeatedly.  But from this
email thread I realize that I have overlooked some of the basics.

I would like to have an authoritative document (preferably WRE) that
provides some sort of clear distinction between these concepts, including a
few examples.  In particular, the fact that one should wrap the suggested
packages in "requireNamespace" has escaped me.  I guess it is not just me
as a large chunk of package authors are applied researchers and not
professional software developers.

Not sure if one should rewrite the docs here, or maybe alternatively create
some sort of simplified version of the document.

Cheers,
Ott

There are tons of simplified versions of the document (in blogs, books, 
mailing list postings, etc.), but many of them also contain errors or 
make up different versions of the advice, so a rewrite or simplified 
version that had the support of R Core would be valuable.

Unfortunately, even if someone else wrote it, it would take a lot of R 
Core work to check it.  And if it was a separate simplified version, 
there'd be likely divergence over time from the full technical version.

"R CMD check" raising issues which beginners can ask about seems like a 
reasonable solution to this problem, as long as there are people willing 
to help them.  It offloads the writing work to the people who are giving 
the responses.  It's still hard for beginners to choose between 
conflicting versions of the advice, but that will always be true, even 
if one version is "endorsed by R Core".

Message-ID: <744913706.118570.1619461921550@ox.hosteurope.de>

Dear R experts,

I am testing my R package 'fsbrain' using the Winbuilder service [1] before submitting a new version to CRAN.

All checks pass under R versions 4.0.5 and 4.1.0 alpha, but the installation fails under R 3.6.3 because of a problem related to rgl, which is a dependency of my package.

The file 00check.log says 'installation failed' and refers to '00install.log', which contains the following message:

------------------Message start-------------------------
* installing *source* package 'fsbrain' ...
** using staged installation
** R
** inst
** byte-compile and prepare package for lazy loading
Error in system.file(paste0(dir, "/rgl", .Platform$dynlib.ext), package = pkg,  : 
  no file found
Warning: 	Loading rgl's DLL failed. 
Warning: Trying without OpenGL...
Error in system.file(paste0(dir, "/rgl", .Platform$dynlib.ext), package = pkg,  :

Error: .onLoad failed in loadNamespace() for 'rgl', details:

  error: Loading failed.

ERROR: lazy loading failed for package 'fsbrain'
* removing 'd:/RCompile/CRANguest/R-oldrelease/lib/fsbrain'
* restoring previous 'd:/RCompile/CRANguest/R-oldrelease/lib/fsbrain'
------------------end-------------------------

The full output of the build process can currently be found at https://win-builder.r-project.org/5Mr7luWmfUNL/

To me it seems that rgl cannot be loaded on the test system, but I do not fully understand the message and what to do about it. I hope somebody here can comment on the message and suggest a solution.

The source code for my package is at https://github.com/dfsp-spirit/fsbrain.

Thanks for your time,

Tim

Message-ID: <D786E655-A45E-4C6B-A7ED-6070DF954739@imperial.ac.uk>

Dear all,

I am in the process of including a large update for my package asteRisk, that will require the usage of large data files (amounting in total to ~100 MB).

Given the CRAN package size limits of 5 MB, I am wondering what is the preferred solution in these cases? I have read multiple possibilities, such as requesting to CRAN to host a data-only package that would be updated very infrequently, or hosting the data in another repository and providing functions in the main package to retrieve the required files.

Thanks a lot in advance for your comments

Best wishes,

Rafa

 *Dear Duncan, Thank you very much for your helpful advice! In addition,
could you kindly help answer my follow-up questions below? *

*Instead of passing the private R package environment to C, is there a way
to alter the namespace so that files in the "R" directory of the package
can be read by the C code but not exported to users? There are specialized
export and import functions in the "roxygen2" package that can be used to

*However, if passing the private R package environment to C is the
only/best way for the R functions to be read by C without getting exported,
could you kindly offer additional advice for how to do this? I can pass an
"environment" object from R to C within an SEXP object in C. However, I'm
not sure how to pass the "environment" object between C functions. For
instance, in the following function, could I declare a "char" object and
save the "environment" object as a "char" within the C code?*












*void maketree_diff(int n,               int nc,               double *y,
            double **data,               int *types,               int

Dear Dirk and Berry,

Thanks a lot for your input and for pointing me to the very nice article on the R Journal. It seems to me that hosting the data via GitHub by using the drat package is the best solution. I will work towards this implementation.

Best wishes,

Hello all,

Normally, when you write a function in R, it returns a value. That way it is easy to write an .Rd file for this function.

However, I have written a function that does no such thing. Rather, it takes as input two data frames, and creates a figure. But doesn't return anything.

In R package language, how do I write the examples in the .R file when I need to define the input variable first as a data frame? I can't just write it as

add(1,2) which returns 3.

Any help?

Thanks so much,
Matthew

2 standard options are to either use an example dataset (eg. data(mtcars))
that fits your function. help(glm) has an example using the anorexia
dataset. A second option is to create toy data in the example itself. Both
help(lm) and help(glm) has examples doing so.

Hello,

I am doing a R CMD check on an R package I have developed. However, I keep
receiving the warning below:

*Files in the 'vignettes' directory but no files in 'inst/doc':*

And

*Files named as vignettes but with no recognized vignette engine:*

I am pretty sure I have the correct YAML header for my vignettes, and also
inst/docs is an older convention for vignettes that's no longer
recommended.

Do you have an idea of what's going wrong? I have attached my YAML header
below as reference.

Sincerely,
Danielle

You may be missing the line

   VignetteBuilder: knitr

in your DESCRIPTION file.  Without that, R won't know how to interpret 
your vignette.

It's also a little unusual to use

   %\VignetteEngine{knitr::markdown}

nowadays; the more common engine is knitr::rmarkdown (but I believe both 
are still supported).  If you make this change you should also have

   rmarkdown::html_vignette

as the output format.

Finally, since a recent update of knitr, you need to make sure that 
package holding the output format (i.e. markdown currently, rmarkdown if 
you make the change above) is declared as a Suggested package in your 
DESCRIPTION file.

Hi Duncan,

Thank you for your feedback!

Unfortunately, when I made the changes recommended I have a new error:


*trying to use CRAN without setting a mirror*

And:
*Error: 'col_ed' is not an exported object from 'namespace:cli'*

My description file includes:

That would be a result of your code.  Do you call install.packages() in 
one of your functions?  Normally you shouldn't do that.

Similarly, something in your code or NAMESPACE file.  Do you refer to 
cli::col_ed, or try to import col_ed from cli?

Do you really have a data subdir in your package? You shouldn't have the 
LazyData line without one.

> Suggests: knitr, rmarkdown*

You shouldn't list knitr in both Depends and Suggests.

Message-ID: <CAGjgynbru2443zo+0iSu6AniZ9En_ZLAxKHA=T2T57keAZDvbg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have been asked by a CRAN member to add references for methods used in
the package, in the description file of DESCRIPTION.

The format to do so seems to be:

authors (year) <doi...>
authors (year) <arXiv:...>
authors (year, ISBN:...)

However, I feel a bit unconfident about how to properly include these
changes, since I haven't find any other examples providing this information
in DESCRIPTION, and what I have read in 'Writing R extensions' is that the
Description field should be just one paragraph. Including these references
at the end of that field seems to break that rule to me.

Does anyone have experience with this or could provide a little more advice
about how to implement these changes?

Thank you,
Eugenio

Eugenio,

the CRAN submission checklist available at

https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/submission_checklist.html

contains some information on how to write a suitable Description entry in 
the DESCRIPTION file for CRAN packages.

This contains:

o Make the Description as informative as possible for potential new users 
of your package. If in doubt, make the Description longer rather than 
shorter, but try to avoid redundancies such as repetitions of the package name.

as well as

o Relevant citations should be included in the description. These should be 
in author-year style, preferably followed by an identifier such as DOI, 
arXiv id, or ISBN for published materials.

Best,
Bettina

Hi Duncan,

I really appreciate your response. Unfortunately, I am still receiving the
error below.

If anyone has ideas, I'd appreciate it!

This is the only online forum I can find that discusses the error, but I
have not found it helpful: https://github.com/r-lib/cli/issues/94

If you could share a reproducible example with us, and/or you could
show the full output, then we could probably help you better.

Hi Gabor,

My full output is below:









*   Error: object 'col_ed' is not exported by 'namespace:cli'   Execution
halted   ERROR: lazy loading failed for package 'packagename'
 -----------------------------------   ERROR: package installation
failedError: 'col_ed' is not an exported object from
'namespace:cli'Execution haltedExited with status 1.*

Unfortunately, I can't share a full reproducible example since this package
is also included in a manuscript for publication.

I don't export any objects named 'col_ed' so I am quite perplexed by this
error message.

I'd appreciate any advice!

Danielle

That's not the _full_ output, unfortunately. And if you can't share a
file that reproduces this (not necessarily your original file!), then
Duncan's advice is all we can tell you: don't install packages in
vignettes.

This isn't about exports, it's about imports.  R thinks you are trying 
to use an object named col_ed from the cli package.

What I would do is search all source files in your package for "col_ed" 
to see where it is being used.  Then figure out why R thinks you are 
trying to get it from the cli package.

cli does export col_red - did you omit the 'r' when calling it from your
package or vignette?

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Best practice for accessing fat JAR Java application
 in R package
Message-ID: <6829cb32-1da5-7d8e-c79f-ab61b30b3fdb@essex.ac.uk>

Dear all,

I wrote an open-source Java software, which I release as a stand-alone 
JAR file. I also wrote an R package, which adds functionality and some 
wrapper functions for the JAR for use without GUI from R. It uses rJava 
for this purpose. So far, I released both the JAR and the R package on 
GitHub and included a function in the R package that would allow the 
user to download the latest JAR and store it in the package installation 
directory under java/.

But this causes unreliability for several reasons. GitHub allows only so 
many downloads per time unit, which occasionally messes up testing and 
end user experience; users sometimes end up with incompatible versions; 
it adds an inconvenient step for the user etc. I was thinking it may be 
more reliable to bundle the two pieces together by including the JAR 
file in the /inst/java directory of the package sources. This would also 
allow me to initialize Java with the JAR file upon loading the package 
without asking the user to download or initialize anything.

However, the JAR file depends on other open-source software in the form 
of JAR files packaged into my JAR file (so my JAR file is a "fat" JAR 
file). For example, I access SQLite databases as part of my Java 
program, and for this I need the SQLite JDBC JAR, which has about 7MB. 
This leads to a note during R CMD check, which, I guess, will prevent 
CRAN submission:

N  checking installed package size ...
      installed size is  9.1Mb
      sub-directories of 1Mb or more:
        java   8.1Mb

As an alternative solution, I wrote a function that would download the 
correct version of the JAR file and store it in inst/java. This function 
would be executed in R/zzz.R during installation. I was hoping the 
freshly downloaded JAR file would then be copied from inst/java to java/ 
in the installation directory of the package in the library path, but 
this does not seem to be the case. Even if it were copied to the desired 
location, the installed package size would still be too large and would 
yield a note.

I would be grateful if somebody could suggest a best practice to deal 
with this problem. Should I aim to include the JAR or store it online? 
If include, how do I deal with the size limitation of the R package for 
CRAN? If store online, how do I deal with the unreliability of GitHub 
and other issues?

Many thanks in advance,

Philip

Hi,

I am not knowledgeable on the topic but if it helps you I know the h2o
package as one pretty fat file(s):
https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_h2o.html

It requires java as well.

Also found the following link on google:
https://thecoatlessprofessor.com/programming/r/size-and-limitations-of-packages-on-cran/

Hopefully someone else will be able to provide you with better guidance.

Best regards
Morgan

Dear All,

Following Dirk's suggestion below, I have recently added a data package as a drat repository for my asteRisk package, placing it under Suggests in the main package.
In order to keep the code tidy and know exactly when I?m accessing the data in the data package, I access all the data in the data package as asteRiskData:::Item

This seems to be working fine, but upon CHECK I am getting the following NOTE: 

  Unavailable namespace imported from by a ':::' call: ?asteRiskData?
    See the note in ?`:::` about the use of this operator.

The mentioned Note says:

It is typically a design mistake to use ::: in your code since the corresponding object has probably been kept internal for a good reason. Consider contacting the packagemaintainer if you feel the need to access the object for anything but mere inspection.

Here I have decided by design to keep the objects internal in the data package, since they are only meant to be accessed by functions of the main package. 
I am wondering if anyone has had any experience with this NOTE before? Is it acceptable to leave it for submission of the updated version to CRAN?

Thanks a lot in advance

Best wishes,

Rafa

I have read multiple possibilities, such as requesting to CRAN to host a data-only package that would be updated very infrequently, or hosting the data in another repository and providing functions in the main package to retrieve the required files.

Why would that be 'tidy'?

Just use two colons as usual for things exported from your data package, and
export everythng that your code package uses from it. The ':::' idiom is not
to be used across package, ie don;t use in package B to access content from
A. Which is what R CMD check is telling your here: "don't do this".

I wouldn't call it "tidy", but there are some possible reasons to do 
this.  One may apply here:

  - You may not want other packages to depend on the data, because you 
would like to be able to change it without notice.  Normally you'd do 
this by making it a private part of the main package, but if it's really 
big, that's discouraged.  So the use described here may be reasonable.

I can't spot it in the docs right now, but I believe CRAN will allow the 
use of ::: if the package it is importing from has the same maintainer 
as the main package.

The problem here is that CRAN doesn't know who is the maintainer for 
asteRiskData.  That package is not on CRAN, and they don't look on other 
repositories to figure it out.

So the answer to Rafael's original question is that I think CRAN would 
agree to this use if you have a good reason for it, but you'll need to 
explain that reason in your submission message, and it will need manual 
intervention to ignore the automatic rejection.

Following Dirk's advice is thus advisable (passing the auto checks is 
better than requiring manual intervention on every update), but not 
strictly necessary.

Dear Dirk and Duncan,

Thanks a lot for your clarifications. Both of your explanations make sense. Indeed, I would rather not have any other packages depend on the data package, at least not for the time being, in case I find good reasons to make modifications in the data package.

But it makes sense to try to pass the auto checks as much as possible. I will work towards trying to avoid :::

Best wishes,

Rafa

There is _nothing_ wrong with a :: for package you have a Suggests: on, and
having a _conditional dependence_ on a large data package is where we
started. You could just use :: in your package, as long as it is inside
blocks of the form
  if (requireNamespace(nameOfDataPackage, quietly=TRUE)) { ... }
or if you really dislike ::,  use a library(nameOfDataPackage).

The key is to use the conditional dependence via such a test in the code.

And the CRAN Repo Policy and Writing R Extensions are moving ever so slowly
in this direction. It is not something that can be enforced yet given both
the number of packages still doing it wrong, and the number of people who
continue repeating that this is a good or acceptable practice. We can and
will do better, just how we moved to using NAMESPACES for a reason.

Dear Dirk,

Thanks a lot for your detailed explanation. This is indeed the solution that I have found to work nicely, and indeed keeps the code equally tidy.
In fact, I am finding that using :: to access exported objects instead of ::: to access any object in the data package even helps me organize the code better, since I have a clear record of the interaction between the 2 packages (in the form of exports in the NAMESPACE of the Data package).
Together with conditional checks to ensure that the data package is available before running code that requires it, it seems to be the best solution to me.

Best wishes,

Rafa

Sorry, I showed you how I did it.  There are certainly other ways, but 
you'll have to dig around in the manuals to find them.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Best way to build CRAN packages that include Rust
 source?
Message-ID: <3E54163E-1DAC-4016-905C-84411A26711A@precisionmethods.guru>

I am appreciating 2 distinct approaches currently used to compile Rust code in R packages:

1. LinkingTo: cargo, as done in https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=salso

2. A more ?traditional?-looking approach built on Autoconf & Automake https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=gifski

Is there any reason why one or the other would be preferred for a CRAN submission?
Would one or the other design better facilitate Rust?s eventual elevation to ?first-class? status (like C++, Fortran) for compiling code in R packages?

In favor of (1), it seems to me that the ?Reverse linking to:? entry at https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cargo nicely advertises packages that use Rust, which could be useful for example code, etc.
In favor of (2), it seems completely idiomatic?and so potentially more conducive to achieving first-class status for Rust.

Hi,

I'm trying to resubmit a package to CRAN that was archived about 1 month
ago. The archived package has a different maintainer. We discussed and they
are OK with me taking over as the new maintainer. Do we need to email CRAN
confirming the change in maintainers even though the package was archived?

The new submission was rejected from CRAN with the note:

Check: CRAN incoming feasibility, Result: NA
  Maintainer: 'Michael Hellstern <mikeh1 at uw.edu>'
  New submission
  Package was archived on CRAN
  CRAN repository db overrides:

      corrected in time.
  The Date field is over a month old.

Thank you for the help!

I think so. See the short discussion in the CRAN Repository Policy document.
Ideally the previous maintainer would signal approval of the change to CRAN
as well.

 dependency on R >= 4.0.4
Message-ID: <B9A9562D-C0A9-46CA-9EDA-BCBD0D35E868@stat.math.ethz.ch>

Dear all

First, the underlying problem is explained in rstudio/rticles#399<https://github.com/rstudio/rticles/issues/399> (along with a reproducible example), but I?ll try to summarize the issue:

As discussed in rstudio/rticles#329<https://github.com/rstudio/rticles/issues/329>, a change in hook management for LaTeX (see this comment<https://github.com/rstudio/rticles/issues/329#issuecomment-705713973>) broke the jss.cls file included with R (share/texmf/tex/latex/jss.cls). This was fixed in R 4.0.4 but as far as I can tell, leaves us with a slightly unsatisfying situation for any R package that include a JSS article as vignette (and is being built with LaTeX newer than fall 2020):

- either you add a recent copy of jss.cls to the package source and do not build-ignore this file; for this you incur a note saying that ?The following files are already in R ... Please remove them from your package.?
- or the package now depends on R >= 4.0.4

Does anyone know of a way out of this? Or am I missing something?

Thanks,
Nicolas

As the package is shipped with the already built vignette, this does not 
induce the version requirement.

Hello,

The R CMD check passed with 0 errors and warnings, so I proceeded to submit
to CRAN. However, CRAN reported 1 error (see below). If you have any
insight as to what this error means, please let me know.

I'm perplexed because *rtracklayer *is not a package dependency, and
I'm not sure where it came from. Perhaps this is a false positive?

Dear Danielle

If you search the most recent postings on this list
https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-package-devel/2021q2/subject.html
you will see that several of them have rtracklayer in their title. Does 
any of them help you?

Note that if they had used an uninformative title as you do it would be 
harder to find them so I have added that to your title.

Message-ID: <5babd6d0-4db4-fb95-877e-300e4c570b2a@stanford.edu>

I submitted a minor update of cubature (suggesting rmarkdown for 
vignettes) and received a message that the package generated warnings. 
However, the warnings were noted to be untrustworthy (see email below). 
I noted this in the submission comments as well as the reply to the 
auto-check email.

It appears that I am unable to get beyond the auto-check service. Any 
suggestions?

Dear CRAN,

As explained in my submission comment, the warning is noted to be flaky 
in the message below.

Thank you.

I think -Warray-bounds is known to be flaky in earlier compilers.? I do 
not see this on macOS with Apple Clang 11.5 (latest for High Sierra) or 
12.4 (current) and nor does Tomas for GCC 10 on Windows.

I have tried for several weeks, and four emails, to get an answer concerning
an auto-archived submission. Ironically, it aimed to address the very 'error
on one platform' issue over which it was archived.

I still haven't heard back.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Installed image not found in Debian
Message-ID: <CAMyz+tXC83T_zPM4h4brZawETtx=ja0x9YmObfL7nG8QyJfx+g@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,
I just submitted a new package 'pliman' (
https://github.com/TiagoOlivoto/pliman) and it does not pass the incoming
checks automatically.
I have some images that are under '/inst/tmp_images' to be installed with
the package. In some examples and Vignettes, I use the helper function
image_pliman() <
https://github.com/TiagoOlivoto/pliman/blob/master/R/utils_imagem.R#L125>
to get the patch of a given image

Then, I use image_import() <
https://github.com/TiagoOlivoto/pliman/blob/master/R/utils_imagem.R#L69> to
import the image into R.

All tests passed in Windows <
https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/pliman_0.1.0_20210511_212904/Windows/00check.log>
but an error was got in Debian <
https://win-builder.r-project.org/incoming_pretest/pliman_0.1.0_20210511_212904/Debian/00check.log
>
The error occurs when image_import () has been called, for example

image_import(image_pliman("soybean_touch.jpg"))
Error:  'soybean_touch' not found in
.//srv/hornik/tmp/CRAN/pliman.Rcheck/pliman/tmp_images

It seems that this error comes from this check <
https://github.com/TiagoOlivoto/pliman/blob/master/R/utils_imagem.R#L92-L97>
that checks if the image name is available in the directory. Please, see a
toy example with my data.

# Get the patch of the image
image <- image_pliman("soybean_touch.jpg")
image
[1] "E:/Documents/R/win-library/4.0/pliman/tmp_images/soybean_touch.jpg"

# Get the directory of the image
img_dir <- file_dir(image)
> img_dir
[1] "E:/Documents/R/win-library/4.0/pliman/tmp_images"

# Get all files in the directory
> all_files <- sapply(list.files(img_dir), file_name)
> all_files
    background.jpg        la_back.jpg        la_leaf.jpg      la_leaves.JPG
      "background"          "la_back"          "la_leaf"        "la_leaves"
    la_pattern.JPG        la_temp.jpg objects_300dpi.jpg       sev_back.jpg
      "la_pattern"          "la_temp"   "objects_300dpi"         "sev_back"
   sev_healthy.jpg       sev_leaf.jpg    sev_leaf_nb.jpg      sev_sympt.jpg
     "sev_healthy"         "sev_leaf"      "sev_leaf_nb"        "sev_sympt"
     soy_green.jpg  soybean_grain.jpg  soybean_touch.jpg
       "soy_green"    "soybean_grain"    "soybean_touch"

# Get the name of the image and check if it is in the directory
> img_name <- file_name(image)
> img_name
[1] "soybean_touch"

if(!grepl("http", img_dir, fixed = TRUE) & !img_name %in% all_files){
  stop(" '", img_name, "' not found in ", img_dir,  call. = FALSE)
}

In this case, there is no error since  "soybean_touch" is in 'all_files'

I have no idea how to fix this issue and why this error occurs only on
Debian and not on Windows. Any suggestion to fix the error and/or improve
the code will be welcome!
Thanks in advance,
Tiago

At the risk of only being mildly (if at all) helpful, I was able
to reproduce your warnings on Rhub, which has the same compiler,
with:

??? rhub::check('cubature_2.0.4.1.tar.gz', platform='windows-x86_64-release')

Absent feedback from CRAN you could try tweaking your code so that
it does not produce those warnings while no changing behavior.
Obviously, iterating with rhub is not the easiest way to do this,
but might be easier than trying to get GCC 8.3.

For reference, you might be hitting:

https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=88273

Maybe you knew that already but it might be useful for others to be
aware there is an actual bug that at least is in the general area
that affects GCC 8.2-8.3.

Best,

B.

Message-ID: <364493b2-b642-4fa3-a515-2678d7695059@Spark>

Hello,

I did some searching and wasn?t able to find a good answer to my question, so I hope that someone here has knowledge of how to fix the problem.

I?m currently trying to create an R package that bundles the CGAL header files (http://www.cgal.org) for easy linking by other packages?that will be in an inst/include directory. Unfortunately, the names of the header files with their directory/subdirectory structures exceed the filename limit for R packages on CRAN. Is there a way to bundle these into the R package without changing their names?

Since these are simply a reproduction of the CGAL header files, I don?t want to change their filenames since that will make their usage different than users would expect, and also make it more difficult to reference documentation on the CGAL website.

For reference, I?m building with R 4.0.3 and have a git repository with the package at <https://github.com/ericdunipace/RcppCGAL>.

Thanks in advance,
Eric Dunipace

CRAN will request that you change the filenames to shorten them.

I have done so each time for the BH package as you will see in its GitHub
repo and the patch files.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Passing CRAN checks for a package linking to a system
 library on CRAN machines
Message-ID: <CAP6q79G7KPwQisw8PubEuovhUZGijy1VT6Q91WbQ7MAQpFxmhw@mail.gmail.com>

I am working on a package which provides an interface to the libsbml C++
library (http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML) in R. The source code of this
package (r2sbml) can be found at the following link

https://github.com/sn248/r2sbml

The package passes CRAN checks with `R CMD check` on my machine, but I do
have dependency (libsbml library) installed on my machine (OSX) with
headers and static libs at the usual locations, i.e., /usr/local/include
and /usr/local/lib. The package also passes CRAN check on a Windows machine
with libsbml installed using Rtools40 and msys2. The DESCRIPTION file lists
libsbml in SystemRequirements but `R CMD check` obviously fails on rhub
machines because there are no instructions to install libsbml first. As I
understand, I have the following options to pass checks on CRAN

1. Bundle the source code of libsbml into the package and make the static
libs on the fly. I don't really want to try this approach even though I
have used this approach before in another package as I think creating the
static lib is not as straightforward for this library because of the large
number of files and complex dependency chart.

2. Include header files in the `inst` folder and pull the static libs from
rwinlib github (assuming the libs can be posted there). I am not sure if
this approach will work on all platforms on which CRAN checks take place.

3. Somehow include instructions to install libsbml on CRAN machines (I have
no idea how to do this), or request CRAN maintainers to install libsbml
with header files and libs at usual locations (i.e., /usr/local/include and
/usr/local/lib).

I am sure some version of this question has been asked before as there are
many packages which interface with C/C++ libraries listed as
SystemRequirements, but I could not find a clear answer to this aspect,
i.e., passing checks on CRAN machines.

Any guidance here and pros/cons of the above mentioned approaches will be
very helpful.

Thanks
Satya

I faced the same problem for my package r2sundials and in the end, I 
have opted for including the third-party source code into the package. 
However, a CRAN team member told me later that such kind of request 
(i.e. install third-party software on CRAN machines) can be sent to the 
CRAN team. Not sure that they accept but I think you can start by asking 
it and if the request is rejected, you can try other options.

Best,
Serguei.

I think the best way for maintenance and end users is when the libraries 
are part of common software distributions R is used with on each 
platforms, which are also installed on CRAN machines. For Linux these 
are popular distributions including Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora. For Windows 
this is customized msys2 (rtools) and customized mxe. For macOS this is 
a custom distribution ("recipes").

So, if your library is already present in those distributions, but not 
installed on some of the CRAN machines, I'd simply ask for it to be 
installed - the installation is trivial in that case, this is what the 
distributions are for.

If the library is not present in those distributions, the next best I 
think is to contribute it to them. In case of Windows, ideally 
contribute also to the upstream vanilla distributions, not just to the 
customized versions for R. This would allow most people to benefit from 
your contribution, and the additional burden on CRAN maintainers (who 
have to deal with many thousands of packages) would be minimized.

If all that failed, and the license allows, one can include the source 
code of the library into the package, but that creates burden on users 
as well as maintainers (of the package, but also the repository). It may 
create confusion about the configuration due to duplication between 
packages. It creates burden for repository maintainers. It takes 
additional time on installation (particularly some libraries heavily 
using C++ take forever to build, and repository maintainers do that very 
often).

Downloading pre-compiled binaries (static libraries) at installation 
time is the worst option in my view. It is non-transparent, 
non-repeatable, and the binaries may be incompatible (e.g. on Windows 
all object files have to be built for the same C runtime). It makes 
maintenance of R much harder, currently the transition from MSVCRT to 
UCRT on Windows.

I think that sundials is a good example why trying the other options 
first is a good suggestion. It is now included in three CRAN packages 
(paropt, r2sundials, sundialr). Apart from the duplication (build time), 
it has a problem of multiply defined symbols (tentative definitions, 
issues with -fno-common, which is the default in GCC 10), which now has 
to be handled in the three packages separately.

Thanks to the encouragement of Brodie Gaslam and Tomas Kalibera (private 
email), I was able to hack the code to avoid the warnings.

The code in question had the following structure:

 ??? int inibits = -1, bit;
 ??? for( j = powers; j; j >>= 1 ) ++inibits;
 ??? memcpy(pv, pini, inibits*sizeof(*pini));


which I changed to:

 ??? int inibits = -1, bit;
 ??? for( j = powers; j; j >>= 1 ) ++inibits;

 ??? int sz = inibits * sizeof(*pini);
 ??? sz = (sz > 0) ? sz : 0;

 ??? memcpy(pv, pini, sz);

to guard against the erroneous gcc 8.3 inference that inibits could 
remain at -1 if powers is zero, known to be not possible.

Best,

-Naras

Hello, All:


	  What are the current recommendations for automatic testing of an R 
package on GitHub?


	  Section 19.3 in the current version of "R Packages" describes 
"Checking after every commit with Travis".  It recommends Travis.  It 
says to use Travis, first "Run usethis::use_travis()".[1]


	  However, 'help("use_travis", package="usethis")' says it's 
deprecated, but I don't understand what is recommended as an alternative.


	  What do you suggest?


	  Thanks,
	  Spencer Graves

'secr' imports from 'stringr' that imports 'stringi', that was updated 10 May. 'secr' does not use 'stringi' directly.  The error also appears on current CRAN tests of 'openCR' 2.0.1 with r-devel-windows-ix86+x86_64.

Can I assume this is a transient problem and advise CRAN accordingly when I update my own package?
