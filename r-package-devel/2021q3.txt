It is rather presumptuous of me to comment, but for what it's worth I
personally would not ignore such a warning.  There is (it seems to me)
always a possibility that the warning is symptomatic of a problem that
could at some stage whip around and bite you on the arse.  I would try
to find out why the directory "vign_test" (unexpectedly?) exists.  Where
does it come from? Who/what created it?

If its possible existence is "understandable" perhaps you should test
for its existence (using file.exists()?) and if it does indeed exist,
don't try to create it.

Feel free to ignore me (and I'll go away! :-) ).

cheers,

Rolf

I agree the warning shouldn't be ignored, but I believe it was created 
by R CMD check, not by Spencer directly.  So the real question is:  why 
was it already there?

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] gettext on Solaris
Message-ID: <CAPRVBcxab6vLt+H+g7VgVROxSx4niEgFhKmJU2SkbFH4sC7g1g@mail.gmail.com>

My new submission potools failed on Solaris:

https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/R.check/r-patched-solaris-x86/potools-00check.html

Likely reason is that one or more of the SystemRequirements are missing (I
put gettext as a catchall in the DESCRIPTION but more specifically it needs
msgfmt, msgmerge, msginit and msgconv).

WRE mentions tests/examples should run without error when command-line
tools are unavailable, so I've added some escapes, but nevertheless I'm a
bit puzzled -- I expected these requirements would be easy to handle since
tools::update_pkg_po() has the same requirements.

Am I right that R's own default packages may be only partially functional
on CRAN checks?

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Change package maintainer
Message-ID: <CAFHOBwzuzE1Q67Pz+wavZdkAJbJPi8ejSqEYOZd2823F=fPkLA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there, I have recently uploaded the first version of my R package to
CRAN. As it is part of my final degree project, I need to change the
maintainer to my supervisor, now that I have finished the project.

I changed in the DESCRIPTION file the proper data to do so, but when
receiving back the email from CRAN the only NOTE I have is this one:

* checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE
Maintainer: 'Fernando Carazo Developer <fcarazo at tecnun.es>'

New maintainer:
  Fernando Carazo Developer <fcarazo at tecnun.es>
Old maintainer(s):
  Javier Garcia Developer <a905125 at alumni.unav.es>


What do I need to do here?

Thank you

Javier

1. Correct the name of the new maintainer whose family name is probably 
not "Developer". Apparently nobody spotted this in your initial submission.

2. After successful submission to CRAN, the old maintainer will receive 
a confirmation request which you have to respond to.

Best,
Uwe Ligges

Hi Uwe:

Is what you described the preferred way to change maintainers  (I have just taken over another package),  or would you prefer receiving an email from the old maintainer before the submission?

Thanks,

-Roy

Both ways are fine with us, but the auto confirmation request will be 
sent out in any case.

Thanks Uwe for answering,

I have a question related to changing maintainers.
What happens when the old/current maintainer does not respond to
emails or other methods of contact?
Would the new maintainer need to wait until the package is removed
from CRAN to submit it again?

Best,

Llu?s

PS: Not sure if my related question should be in another thread or not.

Not speaking for CRAN here but my understanding always was that a full and
complete 'email handshake' with both old and new maintainer was strongly
preferred / the default simply to prevent misunderstandings or shenanigans.

I'd agree in the normal case where the package is still active on CRAN.

In the case where a package has unaddressed issues with no response to 
CRAN from the maintainer, they'd probably be quite happy to have someone 
volunteer to take over.

Hi,

I agree that the email handshake is the best approach (and very
reasonable to expect it).
I thought that maybe in cases like this there was a waiting period
and/or multiple attempts to contact the maintainer and someone on the
mailing list might have had some experience with the process.
When I'm ready to take over the package I will ask the CRAN team and
give them more details.

Many thanks to all.

	  I can suggest one example: multcompView:  I created it during or 
before 2006 and passed it during or before 2011 to Luciano Selzer 
<luciano.selzer at gmail.com>.  I do not remember the exact process, and 
procedures could have changed since then.  However, I think I remember 
communicating with the CRAN maintainers after Selzer and I agreed he 
would take it over.  Beyond that, I see that the DESCRIPTION file for 
multicompView0.1-3 lists BOTH of us as Maintainer.  The version before 
that lists me only, and the one after lists him.[1]


	  Second, last September, Brian Ripley sent an email to 50 different 
people saying gdata had problems, the maintainer had not responded, and 
it was scheduled to be archived along with all its strong reverse 
dependencies on 2020-09-25.  I don't know what happened from that except 
that the package is still on CRAN with date Published: 2017-06-06, but 
my Ecfun package no longer uses it.


	  Beyond that, I'm pretty sure that anyone can adopt a package in the 
archives that is no longer on CRAN and resurrect it if you agree to fix 
the problems.  However, you should discuss with the CRAN maintainers.

Although, the CRAN policies require a single maintainer these days.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] ERROR: lazy loading failed for package 'movecost'
In-Reply-To: <774fb9ef-4e8d-4be7-8ef3-4d973d5f43fb@Spark>

Hello,

I am in the process of checking my ?movecost? package before submitting to CRAN.

As usual, I have tested my package locally (on my MAC) using devtools::check() and everything is fine, getting 0 error, 0 warnings and 0 notes.

Also, as I routinely do, I used (A)?devtools::check_win_devel(); in the returned email, the status was OK (https://win-builder.r-project.org/lWar6m662wl3).

BUT, I got 1 error from both:
(B) devtools::check_win_release() (https://win-builder.r-project.org/6ZzaipUr9rPF)
(C) devtools::check_win_oldrelease() (https://win-builder.r-project.org/yXHZoOCov7xH)

I cannot really figure out what is actually causing the error (Im not a specialist in programming and the like):
ERROR: lazy loading failed for package ?movecost'


Any hint/elucidation on the matter, so that I can spot what is causing the error, would be appreciated.
Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best
Gianmarco

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] R-CMD-check works locally and on github,
 but windows automatic checks fail
Message-ID: <CAApgGZdGbZqUmpVNr1wXZsd_na6+Vg7fAN1FkBZwLyf9TzRVqw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am trying to submit our package scDiffCom (
https://github.com/CyrilLagger/scDiffCom) to CRAN. However, it does not
pass the windows automatic checks for some unclear reason to me. Any help
would be really appreciated!

Basically, the output from R-CMD-check is fine locally and for the github
actions I specified, but not for the automatic windows tests. Please see
below:

------------
1)
no ERRORs, no WARNINGs, no NOTEs when running devtools:check() locally
(windows 10, R 4.1.0)

2)
no ERRORs, no WARNINGs, no NOTEs when running github-actions
<https://github.com/CyrilLagger/scDiffCom/blob/master/.github/workflows/check-standard.yaml>
for windows-latest (release), macOS-latest (release), ubuntu-20.04
(release), ubuntu-20.04 (devel)

3)
1 ERROR when running devtools:check_win_devel: *Running the tests in

to me, it only contains:

> library(testthat)
> library(scDiffCom)
>
> test_check("scDiffCom")
Loading required package: SeuratObject

4)
2 ERRORs when running devtools:check_win_release. As follows:

** running tests for arch 'i386' ... [5s] ERROR

  Running 'testthat.R' [4s]

-----------

Since I have no error locally on my machine, I don't know what I could
change for the automatic tests to work. Also, I don't understand why
the github-action for windows-latest (release) works but not
devtools:check_win_release().

By the way, I installed R devel on my machine in addition to R 4.1.0,
but it turns out I cannot test our package installation because it has
Bioconductor dependencies and "Bioconductor does not yet build and
check packages for R version 4.2" as reported here
<https://github.com/r-hub/rhub/issues/471>. The exact same error
actually also occurs when I run devtools:check_rhub(). It does not
seem to be related to the failure of testthat I reported above, but I
thought it might be useful to mention it.

Thanks in advance for any help/suggestions!

Cyril

That's the windows release version, not devel.

You didn't test windows-devel.

That's a Windows devel run.  That's what you haven't done locally.

You say check_win_devel() above.

Yes, seems related.  If you're depending on a package that won't build, 
your tests will fail.

Perhaps you can reduce your dependence to Suggests, which will give a 
note on the failure to load, but no more.

I don't know if this is under your control, but I believe R-devel will 
not support i386.  (Or is it the last version to do so?  I forget where 
I saw the news.)

Good morning,

I got stuck on what follows.
I have tested a new version of my package locally (on a MAC), and everything is fine.

I got mixed results using:
devtools::check_win_oldrelease() - STATUS OK (R version 4.0.5) -?https://win-builder.r-project.org/7qy6PL8C7ye7

devtools::check_win_release() - 1 ERROR (R version 4.1.0) -?https://win-builder.r-project.org/hlA15dFq5BdR

devtools::check_win_devel()??- 1 ERROR (R Under development (unstable) -?https://win-builder.r-project.org/uQ0LGZ7v0E5h

The reported error seems to be:
ERROR: lazy loading failed for package ?movecost'


I have asked a friend to run devtools::check() on his Win-based machine (running R version 4.1.0), and the test returned no problems (0 error, 0 warning, 0 notes).

Since I cannot reproduce the error neither on my computer nor on a win-based machine, I am at loss of understanding where the issue actually lies.

I would really appreciate any help and/or suggestion.

Best
Gianmarco

Hello,
Further to my earlier email, I think I have located a likely issue, and I would appreciate feedback.

I ran?devtools::check_rhub(), and somewhere in the flood of the output I got there is the following message:

Bioconductor does not yet build and check packages for R version 4.2

The complete report that I got from?devtools::check_rhub() is here:
https://builder.r-hub.io/status/movecost_1.2.tar.gz-cbda0dbe4d7a414498921e9ab2a54aaf


Any idea about how to proceed in order for me to get my package on CRAN?
I am noticing that I am not the only one experiencing that isse (https://github.com/r-hub/rhub/issues/471).

Best
GmA

What happens when you test it on winbuilder?
It is configured like the CRAN incoming checks and there should be all 
relevant packages available.

Hello,
Thanks for your reply.

I got mixed results using:
devtools::check_win_oldrelease() - STATUS OK (R version 4.0.5) - https://win-builder.r-project.org/7qy6PL8C7ye7

devtools::check_win_release() - 1 ERROR (R version 4.1.0) - https://win-builder.r-project.org/hlA15dFq5BdR

devtools::check_win_devel() ?- 1 ERROR (R Under development (unstable) - https://win-builder.r-project.org/uQ0LGZ7v0E5h

The reported error is to be:
ERROR: lazy loading failed for package ?movecost?

Since I couldn?t understand the actual underlying issue, I ran?devtools::check_rhub() (as described in my earlier email) which brought to the fore the Bioconductor issue.

I have tested the package on Win (R version 4.1) and everything was fine.

I hope I have addressed your question.
Please let me know if you need any other relevant info from my end.

Best
Gm

I think the Bioconductor error on R-hub is a red herring. The error
message is printed, but the actual error is ignored. So this is really
only an issue if you do need a Bioconductor package for the check.

I think the issue might be that for R-devel CRAN binaries are x64
only, but R CMD INSTALL and R CMD check still try to install the
package for i386 as well. Dependencies (e.g. chron in this case) will
not be available on i386.

At least this is the issue for R-hub, because it uses CRAN binaries by
default: https://artifacts.r-hub.io/movecost_1.2.tar.gz-cbda0dbe4d7a414498921e9ab2a54aaf/movecost.Rcheck/00install.out

AFAICT Win-builder has its own package library, which might have i386
support, I don't know. So maybe the issue is different there.

For the lazy loading error, if you are not intentionally lazy loading data, you should remove the lazy loading entry from the description file.  Previously this was not causing any problems with the CRAN checks, but now it is.

Hello,
Thanks for your reply.

I got mixed results using:
devtools::check_win_oldrelease() - STATUS OK (R version 4.0.5) - https://win-builder.r-project.org/7qy6PL8C7ye7

devtools::check_win_release() - 1 ERROR (R version 4.1.0) - https://win-builder.r-project.org/hlA15dFq5BdR

devtools::check_win_devel()  - 1 ERROR (R Under development (unstable) - https://win-builder.r-project.org/uQ0LGZ7v0E5h

The reported error is to be:
ERROR: lazy loading failed for package ?movecost?

Since I couldn?t understand the actual underlying issue, I ran devtools::check_rhub() (as described in my earlier email) which brought to the fore the Bioconductor issue.

I have tested the package on Win (R version 4.1) and everything was fine.

I hope I have addressed your question.
Please let me know if you need any other relevant info from my end.

Best
Gm

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] weird C stack traces from win-builder,
 due to brms/rstan load?
Message-ID: <8263f0ef-c0e3-58cd-0ee8-ab3fa409d1f0@mcmaster.ca>

  I'm running into trouble checking a new release of the 'broom.mixed' 
package <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/broom.mixed/index.html> 
on win-builder.  I think it is some kind of rstan problem.

   The broom.mixed package loads the brms package, and loads several 
pre-computed objects from the brms package; I don't think it actually 
tries to run anything of the functions from brms during the check process.

   At several points during checking (see 
<https://win-builder.r-project.org/LsDDMqpnX52n/00check.log>), I get 
voluminous "C stack trace" outputs: once when "Checking dependencies in 
R code", once when calling require(brms) as part of an example, once 
when running the tests (not easy to determine the precise location, and 
once when building the vignettes).

   The trace starts like this:

==== C stack trace ===============================

	SETCAR [0x0x6c838a90+32]
	ZN4Rcpp8CppClassC1EPNS_6ModuleEPNS_10class_BaseERNSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE [0x0x6ac093ff+1151]
	ZN4Rcpp6Module12classes_infoEv [0x0x6ac07467+327]
	Z20Module__classes_infoP7SEXPREC [0x0x6abe1c4a+74]
	Rf_NewFrameConfirm [0x0x6c7a7d18+33960]
	R_initAssignSymbols [0x0x6c7f3259+53849]
	Rf_eval [0x0x6c7fcd31+369]
...

   and goes on for a while.

   R CMD check runs fine on Linux with recent r-devel.

   Has anyone seen this?  Other than scrubbing all references to brms 
and rstan (a second try with one of the brms references avoided instead 
runs into trouble when loading rstan ...), I don't see what I can do ...

<https://win-builder.r-project.org/YArr24tuYZ8G/00check.log>

   cheers

What error do you get before the stack trace?

The Z... names look like C++ entry points to overloaded functions or 
methods.  There's a command line function (c++filt) that will usually 
turn those into their original readable form.  It's not working for me 
on the names you've got; maybe because I'm on a Mac, and that was 
compiled on Windows.  Perhaps someone else knows how to demangle those 
names?

   No obvious errors at all before the stack trace. I'm pretty sure that 
the stack trace is caused by the *act of loading the rstan package*.

   I guess the next thing to do would be to make a dummy package that 
does *nothing* but try to load rstan ... ?

=---

Here's the start of the text the first time this appears:

* checking dependencies in R code ... NOTE

   Here is another example:

I think the stack trace is omitting the initial underscore in the symbol

Hello,
Thank you all for the suggestions.

I am starting being a bit worried because I seem not being able to fix the issue.

I have never experienced issues with this package (movecost);
the last new version I have released to CRAN was released a couple of weeks ago with no issue whatsoever.

The new version I am trying to get on CRAN has just one difference: the ?chorn??package?has been added to the dependencies.
Now, I have tried to drop that new dependency, and I have run the tests. Same result.
The test using?devtools::check_win_release() and?devtools::check_win_devel() both return 1 error (lazy loading failed for package ?movecost?)

The test using?devtools::check_win_oldrelease() is OK.


I also tried to keep the new dependency and to drop the lazy download instead (in DESCRIPTION I have put?LazyData: false). I got the same results as above.

The package checks perfectly on my MAC, and checked perfectly when I asked a Win users to test the package on his PC (with the latest version of R).


I am really scratching my head.

Best

Did you try completely removing the LazyData line from the description file?

Hello,
Thanks for your reply.

I got mixed results using:
devtools::check_win_oldrelease() - STATUS OK (R version 4.0.5) - https://win-builder.r-project.org/7qy6PL8C7ye7

devtools::check_win_release() - 1 ERROR (R version 4.1.0) - https://win-builder.r-project.org/hlA15dFq5BdR

devtools::check_win_devel() - 1 ERROR (R Under development (unstable) - https://win-builder.r-project.org/uQ0LGZ7v0E5h

The reported error is to be:
ERROR: lazy loading failed for package ?movecost?

Since I couldn?t understand the actual underlying issue, I ran devtools::check_rhub() (as described in my earlier email) which brought to the fore the Bioconductor issue.

I have tested the package on Win (R version 4.1) and everything was fine.

I hope I have addressed your question.
Please let me know if you need any other relevant info from my end.

The complete report that I got from devtools::check_rhub() is here:
https://builder.r-hub.io/status/movecost_1.2.tar.gz-cbda0dbe4d7a4144
98921e9ab2a54aaf


Any idea about how to proceed in order for me to get my package on CRAN?
I am noticing that I am not the only one experiencing that isse (https://github.com/r-hub/rhub/issues/471).

Good morning,

I got stuck on what follows.
I have tested a new version of my package locally (on a MAC), and everything is fine.

I got mixed results using:
devtools::check_win_oldrelease() - STATUS OK (R version 4.0.5) -
https://win-builder.r-project.org/7qy6PL8C7ye7

devtools::check_win_release() - 1 ERROR (R version 4.1.0) -
https://win-builder.r-project.org/hlA15dFq5BdR

devtools::check_win_devel() - 1 ERROR (R Under development
(unstable) - https://win-builder.r-project.org/uQ0LGZ7v0E5h

The reported error seems to be:
ERROR: lazy loading failed for package ?movecost'


I have asked a friend to run devtools::check() on his Win-based machine (running R version 4.1.0), and the test returned no problems (0 error, 0 warning, 0 notes).

Since I cannot reproduce the error neither on my computer nor on a win-based machine, I am at loss of understanding where the issue actually lies.

I would really appreciate any help and/or suggestion.

Best
Gianmarco

Thanks.  It doesn't work for me with the leading underscore, but I'm 
using a clang based compiler, not gcc, so maybe that explains it.  (I've 
tried most of the --format= options, without success.)

Hello,
Thank you.
Yes I just tried that option, but I still get the same ?error:

Dear David,

where did you get this "idea" that 'LazyData'  is not good  for
 R 4.1.0 and newer ?

R's own  {datasets} package  *does* use lazyloading, and so do
most (formally) recommended packages, and I think most packages
I (co-)maintain, i.e., around two dozen CRAN packages do use
lazyloaded data.

---
*) The `Matrix` package is a big exception with 'Lazyload: No'
because its datasets partly are (S4-) classed objects from the package
itself, and -- as the "WRE" ('Writing R Extensions') manual
states -- package datasets must not *need* the package itself when
they should be lazy loaded.

Martin:

What I suggested was he remove the LazyData entry from the description file
if he was NOT lazy loading data.  If someone is lazy loading data, then that
is a different situation, and they obviously need to set the entry. 

But clearly Gm has a different problem.  He has now tried "LazyData: true",
"LazyData: false", and removing the LazyData entry entirely.  And he is
still getting this error:  

* installing *source* package 'movecost' ...
** using staged installation
** R
** data
** byte-compile and prepare package for lazy loading
ERROR: lazy loading failed for package 'movecost'
* removing 'd:/RCompile/CRANguest/R-release/lib/movecost'


So changing the description entry isn't helping.  Maybe someone else has a
suggestion of what to try next.


David

FWIW I think this is lazy loading of the code, which I think is
 different to what LazyData controls.? This is described in 
R-Internals:

https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-ints.html#Lazy-loading

I know nothing about it so I will not comment further.

Best,

B.

Thank you all. I appreciate your help and discussion so far.

To complicate the matter further, I have done an experiment. I have tried to test a new version which is 99.9% identical to the last official one on CRAN because I wanted to understand if the issue was with some??new code added to the version I have been testing in the last couple of days.

The new version 1.2 (virtually identical to the 1.1 on CRAN) did not pass the tests as per my earlier description. Same errors. The only Ok is on my computer and with devtools? winoldrealeases()

I really don?t know that to do next.

Best
Gm

FWIW I'm having the same issue with package NetLogoR (
https://github.com/PredictiveEcology/NetLogoR/)

Passing windows tests locally but code can't be lazy loaded on winbuilder,
except for oldrel.

Both NegLogoR and movecost have a lot of hard dependencies -- so many 
that I'm unwilling to install them with the limited bandwidth that I 
have right now.  I suspect that's related to the problem:  some 
dependency install is failing, and that causes something else to fail, 
and that leads to the not-very-informative failure messages.

This kind of problem is quite a lot of work to debug.  If I were going 
to attempt to do it, I would go for a bisection strategy:

  - Do you have any old revision which succeeds?  If so, use bisection 
on the revisions until you find the change which first triggers the error.

  - Perhaps no versions succeed, because something external to your 
package has triggered the error.  In this case, bisection would work on 
the dependencies:  cut out half of the dependencies and all the code 
that depends on those.  Have you fixed the error?  If so, add back half 
of the dependencies, otherwise cut out half of the remaining ones.

  - If you're still getting the errors after cutting out all of the 
dependencies, then start cutting out code and data. Etc.

In any case, try to find a version of the package that doesn't trigger 
the error, and a minimal change to it that does.  Then perhaps you'll 
understand the root cause of the error.

Thanks for the suggestion Duncan.

The same code version ran on winbuilder last week, but it's broken this
week.

I'll compare the dependencies between the two packages and focus on those
used by both for now, to see if it's caused by a broken dependency.

If that happened with a released version of R, then it could be that 
some new package version is causing the problem, or it could be a 
transient problem on Winbuilder.

Devel versions of R change every day, so there are more possibilities 
for origins of the problem there.

I also get from Winbuilder:

** byte-compile and prepare package for lazy loading
ERROR: lazy loading failed for package 'secr'

even for the tar.gz of the version secr 4.4.4 that currently passes all checks on CRAN. Perhaps it is significant that secr also imports from raster that had a new version on CRAN 18th June.

If that happened with a released version of R, then it could be that
some new package version is causing the problem, or it could be a
transient problem on Winbuilder.

Devel versions of R change every day, so there are more possibilities
for origins of the problem there.

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] clarification about missing suggested packages.
Message-ID: <d2147327-163e-75eb-d288-52c245ec248b@gmail.com>


   We are working on a resubmission of a package 
(https://github.com/glmmTMB/glmmTMB/issues/721 for people who want all 
the gory details). Our last hurdle is that one of the packages in 
"Suggests:", DHARMa, is currently unavailable on Solaris, even though it 
in good standing on CRAN 
<https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DHARMa/index.html>. (This stems 
from a circular dependency: DHARMa can't be built on Solaris because the 
_previous_ version of glmmTMB, which DHARMa imports, had a bug on 
Solaris ...)

   We have been testing on r-hub's solaris platform, where DHARMa is 
similarly unavailable. We can only pass tests if we set 
_R_CHECK_FORCE_SUGGESTS_=false; otherwise we get an error that says some 
suggested packages are missing.

   It is my understanding that the CRAN maintainers can either

    * test with _R_CHECK_FORCE_SUGGESTS_=false and yell at us if we have 
used any missing/unavailable packages unconditionally or

    * test with _R_CHECK_FORCE_SUGGESTS_=true and ensure that all 
suggested packages are installed

but that it would be unreasonable to reject package A because it has a 
Suggests: dependency on package B that is in good standing on CRAN but 
is not available on a particular CRAN testing platform, as long as 
package A only uses package B conditionally.

   Thoughts/opinions/evidence?

   cheers
     Ben Bolker

 From the current CRAN policy:

     Packages on which a CRAN package depends should be available from a 
mainstream repository: if any mentioned in ?Suggests? or ?Enhances? 
fields are not from such a repository, where to obtain them at a 
repository should be specified in an ?Additional_repositories? field of 
the DESCRIPTION file (as a comma-separated list of repository URLs) or 
for other means of access, described in the ?Description? field.

     A package listed in ?Suggests? or ?Enhances? should be used 
conditionally in examples or tests if it cannot straightforwardly be 
installed on the major R platforms. (?Writing R Extensions? recommends 
that they are always used conditionally.)

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] invalid DOIs
Message-ID: <AM0PR0102MB3267F44650383BDD43CBE81FF71B9@AM0PR0102MB3267.eurprd01.prod.exchangelabs.com>

Hello everyone,

I'm updating the R package image.textlinedetector which is already on CRAN.
When doing R CMD check on winbuilder. I receive the note:

Found the following (possibly) invalid DOIs:
  DOI: 10.1117/12.704538
    From: DESCRIPTION
    Status: Internal Server Error
    Message: 500

The relevant part in the DESCRIPTION file which caused this note looks like this:
... by Arivazhagan M. et al (2007) <doi:10.1117/12.704538>, and a wrapper for an image segmentation ...

This DOI hasn't changed and CRAN seems to parse it fine as the link is shown at the DESCRIPTION of the web page of the package at https://cran.r-project.org/package=image.textlinedetector
How to solve this? What is the correct doi to put in here?

many thanks for your help,
Jan

Subject: [R-pkg-devel] Error uploading package to CRAN that depends on
 packages hosted in GitHub
Message-ID: <CADZW5XGFdmcGn7WHG5+kYu+xAk8H=rznpen9jAcnippPG_kdaQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everybody,

I developed an R package that depends on packages hosted in GitHub.
In the DESCRIPTION file, I added the R packages (from GitHub ) in the
"Suggests" section and I included a copy of them in my personal GitHub so
they can be accessed in the "Additional_repositories:" section.


Suggests:
    rmarkdown,
    ANTsR,
    ANTsRCore,
    ITKR,
    extrantsr,
    MNITemplate,
    RAVEL
Imports:
    knitr,
    oro.nifti,
    fslr,
    neurobase
Depends:
    R (>= 3.5)
Additional_repositories: https://davidpayares.github.io/drat


A copy of the R packages my package needs is in
https://davidpayares.github.io/drat .
When I submit the package to CRAN, I get this error:


Suggests or Enhances not in mainstream repositories:
    ANTsR, ANTsRCore, ITKR, extrantsr, MNITemplate, RAVEL
  Availability using Additional_repositories specification:
    ANTsR         yes   https://davidpayares.github.io/drat
    ANTsRCore     yes   https://davidpayares.github.io/drat
    ITKR          yes   https://davidpayares.github.io/drat
    extrantsr     yes   https://davidpayares.github.io/drat
    MNITemplate   yes   https://davidpayares.github.io/drat
    RAVEL         yes   https://davidpayares.github.io/drat

Flavor: r-devel-linux-x86_64-debian-gcc, r-devel-windows-ix86+x86_64
Check: package dependencies, Result: ERROR
  Packages suggested but not available for checking:
    'ANTsR', 'ANTsRCore', 'ITKR', 'extrantsr', 'MNITemplate', 'RAVEL'

  Namespace dependencies missing from DESCRIPTION Imports/Depends entries:
    'MNITemplate', 'RAVEL', 'extrantsr'

I found that this is the correct way to add dependencies that are not
hosted in CRAN. However, I do not understand why it is not working. If
anyone could help me, I would really appreciate it.

Thank you so much.

Cheers,

David Payares

I think this one is the part causing the ERROR.  Without seeing your 
package I can't say for sure, but I would guess you have made some 
unconditional use of those three packages.  Since they are only 
Suggested packages, you can't do that.  Your package has to run even if 
they are not available at all.  (It may not have full functionality, but 
it shouldn't generate any errors in its tests or examples.)

As the message says: You likely have declared some import directives via 
the NAMESPACE file. In that case you have to import from a package and 
hence list it in the Imports field.

If the package is not available from a mainsteam repository and you want 
to suggest it only, you cannot import from it via the NAMESPACE file.

Best,
Uwe Ligges

importFrom(MNITemplate,readMNI)
importFrom(RAVEL,maskIntersect)
importFrom(RAVEL,normalizeRAVEL)
importFrom(extrantsr,ants_regwrite)
importFrom(extrantsr,bias_correct)

From roxygen2 directives like this:

Many publishers (one worse than the other) seem to have very flakey 
internet resources and web servers are poorly set up, hence simply 
ignore this.

Maybe the message should say "NAMESPACE dependencies missing from 
DESCRIPTION Imports/Depends entries" to make that even more obvious?

Dear All,
Thanks for the useful discussion.

After Uwe?s prompt, I have tested the package again, and everything is fine now.
Was it a CRAN issue?

Whatever the issue was, I am glad my new version is bound to be on CRAN soon (I have just submitted it).

Best
Gianmarco

Dear All,
Thanks for the useful discussion.

After Uwe?s prompt, I have tested the package again, and everything is fine now.
Was it a CRAN issue?

Whatever the issue was, I am glad my new version is bound to be on CRAN soon (I have just submitted it).

Best
Gianmarco

even for the tar.gz of the version secr 4.4.4 that currently passes all checks on CRAN. Perhaps it is significant that secr also imports from raster that had a new version on CRAN 18th June.

Thanks for the suggestion Duncan.

The same code version ran on winbuilder last week, but it's broken this
week.

If that happened with a released version of R, then it could be that
some new package version is causing the problem, or it could be a
transient problem on Winbuilder.

Devel versions of R change every day, so there are more possibilities
for origins of the problem there.

Duncan Murdoch


I'll compare the dependencies between the two packages and focus on
those used by both for now, to see if it's caused by a broken dependency.

Both NegLogoR and movecost have a lot of hard dependencies -- so many
that I'm unwilling to install them with the limited bandwidth that I
have right now. I suspect that's related to the problem: some
dependency install is failing, and that causes something else to fail,
and that leads to the not-very-informative failure messages.

This kind of problem is quite a lot of work to debug. If I were going
to attempt to do it, I would go for a bisection strategy:

- Do you have any old revision which succeeds? If so, use bisection
on the revisions until you find the change which first triggers the
error.

- Perhaps no versions succeed, because something external to your
package has triggered the error. In this case, bisection would work on
the dependencies: cut out half of the dependencies and all the code
that depends on those. Have you fixed the error? If so, add back half
of the dependencies, otherwise cut out half of the remaining ones.

- If you're still getting the errors after cutting out all of the
dependencies, then start cutting out code and data. Etc.

In any case, try to find a version of the package that doesn't trigger
the error, and a minimal change to it that does. Then perhaps you'll
understand the root cause of the error.

Thank you all. I appreciate your help and discussion so far.

To complicate the matter further, I have done an experiment. I
have tried
to test a new version which is 99.9% identical to the last
official one on
CRAN because I wanted to understand if the issue was with some
new code
added to the version I have been testing in the last couple of days.

The new version 1.2 (virtually identical to the 1.1 on CRAN) did
not pass
the tests as per my earlier description. Same errors. The only
Ok is on my
computer and with devtools? winoldrealeases()

I really don?t know that to do next.

But clearly Gm has a different problem. He has now tried

Yup, our bad.

While we test against 2300+ reverse depends, we only test against them _under
the most recent versions we have seen_ which affects the Rcpp under test, and
we do not have an (explicit) test vector for these 2300+ packages tested
against everything built under the _CRAN_ version of Rcpp.  So the need for
one small adjustment slipped til we made it to CRAN, which caused this issue,
and one for broom.mixed (as we communicated off-list to Ben).

In short, no matter how large you try to span your test coverage and surface,
there will always be a residual chance for something slipping through.

"the narrower the window, the more likely you are to hit it."  :)

   In the process of trying to get a package to build successfully on 
r-hub's Fedora platform, I had to add a whole bunch of LaTeX .sty files 
to the vignette directory.  One of these was collectbox.sty, which 
triggers the NOTE

    So I put collectbox.dtx into the inst/misc directory in the package. 
Fine.

  Now, what do I need to do to (1) make sure that my DESCRIPTION file is 
correct and (2) hopefully, suppress the NOTE so I don't have to explain 
it to the CRAN maintainers every time?

* Do I change the LICENCE line (which is currently AGPL-3)? According to 
https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html#Licensing it would 
seem I would have to switch to "file LICENCE" (adding a 
"Licence_is_FOSS: yes"), where "LICENCE" contains something like

package code licensed under AGPL-3; file vignettes/collectbox.sty is 
under the LaTeX Project Public License (source provided in 
misc/collectbox.dtx)

? Should it say "file LICENCE" or "AGPL-3 + file LICENCE" ?

* Do I just include the files without comment, since I have complied (as 
far as I can tell) with the terms of the LPPL?

* Is there a way to signal to R CMD check that I *have* complied with 
the terms?

   cheers

I'll let others discuss the technical details of how to set up the licence
files.  I want to make sure you know that using AGPL is a good way to
ensure that nobody in tech uses your package.  Maybe that's intended, but
when I was at Google the ONLY software we were specifically prohibited from
using was code released under AGPL. I won't try to convince you of that
being a good or bad thing, but wanted to make sure you were aware of it.
