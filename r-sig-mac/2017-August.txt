Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] shasum of R-3.4.1.pkg OS X binary
Message-ID: <76247F43-0500-4628-B981-ADB957664A1E@gmx.de>

It appears that the SHA-hash of the OS X 3.4.1. binary (for OS X 10.11 and higher) does not match the value provided on the website.

shasum R-3.4.1.pkg
ed1adc9e2982bbe9bb46ce0ec5fe992dd7a534db  R-3.4.1.pkg

while the SHA-hash value on the website is given as 4138852c052a2056ce648d886b9b47d8a514b762

The md5 hash value is correct, however. Is this a typo on the website?

I started by using some of the publicly available datasets from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Plotting the Level 3 Statistical Area boundaries took over 2 hours on my 2012 Mac Book Pro. As there were over 3M rows in the fortify?ed data frame I initially thought this was just how long it must take. I then ran the exact same script on my work laptop which is similarly spec?ed and it ran in approximately 30 seconds. This now has me extremely disappointed in the performance on the Mac which is where I use R the most. I changed my BLAS library to the Accelerate library in a whim that this might make a difference. It did not. Whilst I primarily use RStudio I also ran the same script in R.app and if there was any improvement it was not noticeable. I did notice in the Windows run that it seemed to use multiple cores (which is what made me investigate the BLAS change) whilst the Mac seems to stay bound to a single core. My initial thoughts were that it must be something to do with ggplot but after sampling the rsession process a number of times (see attached Sample of rsession.txt) it appears to be spending most of it?s time in CGContextDrawPath in Apples CoreGraphics so I assume it is a Graphics related issue. I?m running R 3.4 on my Mac and 3.3.2 on the Windows machine. I?ve attached the script, process sample text and a number of screen shots that I hope will be helpful in analysing the issue. Could someone possibly let me know if this is PEBKAC issue or an actual problem with R. If the later how do I go about getting the issue resolved?

I tried opening that .R file (which I was surprised made it through the usual scrubbing process) and I see this at the top.
=====copied=====
library(rio)
library(ggplot2)
library(rgdal)
library(rgeos)
library(dplyr)

convert("../Data/ABS/14100DS0001_2017-03.xlsx", "absregdata.csv")
======end-copy===

After seeing that I went looking in the linked document which was really not a link to a document. I did find the referenced document on that page and downloaded the file:

http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/subscriber.nsf/log?openagent&1270055001_sa3_2016_aust_shape.zip&1270.0.55.001&Data%20Cubes&43942523105745CBCA257FED0013DB07&0&July%202016&12.07.2016&Latest

That's the shapefile that is referenced later in the code, but I see no way to find the CSV file that you are loading. So I see no method of reproducing your observations.

You are also several version behind the current dplyr release. I happen to have the same outdated versions of rgdal, rgeos, and sp packages but they, too, are slightly out-of-date.

So unable to attempt reproducing your difficulties. You should try at a minimum to supply data that will allow this. You should also try starting your Mac with a minimum of of other loaded applications on a clean session. memory fragmentation often prevents execution of large jobs in memory and long times are possible if you need to page out to disk and do not have a SSD device as your system disk.

(I'm able to read but not to understand the results of your sampling. It's possible that more savvy users of macs will be able to tell whether my hypothesis, that this is caused by paging-out to disk, is correct.

Hope this helps;
David.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] mirroring the cran build environment for R 3.4.x under
 El-capitan + (10.11+) MacOS
Message-ID: <CA76DBD2-BE7D-441B-9FB2-336B240C8827@ed.ac.uk>

Hi all,

Couple of  questions about how CRAN is building packages for OSX under R 3.4.X El Cap+, prompted by our package (OpenMx) failing CRAN builds (despite building fine locally).

Q1: Is it the case that there?s no equivalent of the win.build system for package creators to test their packages against before submission?

We thought  https://builder.r-hub.io would be ideal for this but apparently r.hub and the CRAN build are differenent? It would seem ideal to set-up r-hub identically to the CRAN check machine? Is that possible?

Q2: Can someone (Simon?) clarify here what the CRAN mac build system is? Specifically:

1. For Clang one uses  clang-4.0.0-darwin15.6-Release.tar.gz<http://r.research.att.com/libs/clang-4.0.0-darwin15.6-Release.tar.gz>  located at  here http://r.research.att.com/libs

2. For  Fortran one uses OS X El Capitan (10.11): download gfortran 6.1<http://coudert.name/software/gfortran-6.1-ElCapitan.dmg> from https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortranBinaries#MacOS (even if one if running 10.12 or 10.13, right?)

3. Make file. Is this the make file being used for CRAN check?

~/.R/Makevars

CC=/usr/local/clang4/bin/clang
CXX=/usr/local/clang4/bin/clang++
LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/clang4/lib


Many thanks if it is possible to clarify building packages to mirror CRAN check under 3.4.X

PS: It would be great to have an Apple installer package for Clang? Perhaps getting installer packages for the build environment would be a good project for https://builder.r-hub.io ? (they are seeking <$10k projects with wide benefit, and I would have thought that keeping up an apple pkg for building R would fit that bill perfectly!!

Tim,

I've run the example code on the page below and resized the plots with no
errors.

https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cowplot/vignettes/plot_grid.html

It may have something to do with running High Sierra, or the specific
code/data you are using.

Could you post a reproducible example?

Looks like a bug under High Sierra.
Repro
1. Close any open Quartz  graphics window
2. Running the example on the top of the cowplot page you linked.

Obtained:  useMethod("depth") error when the second plot tries to render (no need to resize the window)

Running the code a second time (i.e., when an already open graphics window) there's no error.

Repro  code:
theme_set(theme_cowplot(font_size=12)) # reduce default font size
plot.mpg <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, colour = factor(cyl))) +  geom_point(size=2.5)
plot.diamonds <- ggplot(diamonds, aes(clarity, fill = cut)) + geom_bar() +  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=70, vjust=0.5))
plot_grid(plot.mpg, plot.diamonds, labels = c('A', 'B'))

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] R 3.4.1 post-installation problems in Mac OSX 10.12.6
Message-ID: <CAMLd9E7COXRSQ=-8heesyH1mn=V3GJDWmc0Bh46QQ8na40+_vg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I installed R 3.4.1 on Mac OSX 10.12.6 version.

On opening Preferences and trying to change the editor font by
clicking the select button I get following error message in R.

2017-08-28 11:57:41.551 R[809:11355] *** RController: caught ObjC
exception while processing system events. Update to the latest GUI
version and consider reporting this properly (see FAQ) if it persists
and is not known.
*** reason: *** -initForReadingWithData: nil argument
*** name: NSInvalidArgumentException, info: (null)
*** Version: R 3.4.1 (72865) R.app R 3.4.1 GUI 1.70 El Capitan build
Consider saving your work soon in case this develops into a problem.

Interestingly, I do not see the normal courier font that shows up when
one clicks editor in preferences of R. Screenshot attached.


My sessioninfo() is below.
