Perhaps you'll have better luck asking on the StatET mailing list:

Your font library has probably become corrupted. Use Font Book.app to  
look at Times, Courier, Helvetica and Symbol and remove any duplicate  
entries that are blank.

Were you curious enough after reading that posting to enter the  
following at the command line?

quartzFonts()

I don't have a solution, but you may get another clue to where the problem
lies if you send the plot directly to a file, and see whether the text
shows up there.

pdf()
# your plot commands here
dev.off()


Then look at Rplots.pdf in your working directory.

Assuming that the quartz device is the current device that is. What  
does dev.cur() return?

Hi Adrian,

Just to let you know I experienced exactly the same problem a couple of weeks ago, after upgrading my operating system from 10.4 to 10.6. I also couldn't find any duplicate fonts using FontBook. I've found that specifying family = "sans" in the plotting command, i.e.:

plot(x, y, family = "sans")

Gets the text on the graphs in Helvetica (the default setting). It's not a proper fix, but it does work!

Cheers,

Phil

Hi list,

I worked with the package spatstat many times without 
problems, but now when I call for the package the following 
error appears with mgcv: 

require("spatstat")

Loading required package: spatstat
Loading required package: mgcv
Error : .onAttach failed in attachNamespace() for 'mgcv', details:
call: formatDL(nm, txt, indent = max(nchar(nm, "w")) + 3)
error: incorrect values of 'indent' and 'width'
Error: package 'mgcv' could not be loaded

I tried to install mgcv alone using install.packages("mgcv")
but the error persists.

I am working in a Mac Book Pro through Snow Leopard.

Any idea about how to solve it?

Thanks a lot,

Rodrigo

Hi Ken,

Yes. It is the latest version of R.

Hi Rodrigo,

There seems to be a mismatch somewhere.

In the absence of anyone with a better idea, I would try reinstalling R and then spatstat and its dependencies.

Message-ID: <DC6549CC-141F-42C2-8667-D5C4E96FE070@keithljelp.com>

Hi,

I have an iMac 2.8 GHz intel Core 2 Duo, 2GB 800 MHz SDRAM, OSX  
10.5.8, TeXShop 2.36, and R 2.11.1.  I have all the Sweave files in  
the TeXShop ~/Engines folder.

It has been six or seven months since I last tried to compile a Rnw  
file in TeXShop and now I get the following error:

/Users/keithjones/Library/TeXShop/Engines/Sweave.engine does not have  
the executable bit set.

It worked fine the last time I used it.  Has something changed in the  
OS?  How do I set the executable bit?

Thanks,


Keith Jones

	Dear all,

I have had trouble with R crashing during the startup. This has happened on two different mac laptops. An old 13" and a new macbook pro running 10.6.4. 
I have looked at the archive on the mailing list and other discussions, but non has helped, i.e. I could not find and .Rdata, history or workspace files.
Since this has happened on two machines by now, help would be much appreciated, otherwise I will run out of money soon.

Many thanks in advance!

All the best, Philipp

P.S. I attach the problem report.

Have you looked at the R-Mac-FAQ? Last entry suggests that you  
identify and delete the .RData file. (Oh wait, maybe that is what you  
are trying to follow.)

This is the correct place to post, but because I know exactly where to  
find an answer for this on on R-help, I will use that archive:

Strictly speaking, not an Sweave error, but an application permissions error on a third party add-on.

Go into Applications -> Utilities -> Disk Utility.

Select the HD in the left hand frame and then run Repair Disk Permissions towards the bottom of the right hand frame.

Then re-try to run the program. If that does not work, you may need to re-install the files in question.

HTH,

Marc Schwartz

Your log doesn't show a crash - so it is really crashing?

I just used migration assistant to move from a PPC G4 to an Intel based Mac Book Pro, and I'm having all sorts of ghosts like this, too.

Try, in the named directory below,

sudo chmod +x Sweave.engine

You'll have to give it your user password, but that should set the executable bit.

  I'm not on a Mac, but what's wrong with

Howdy,

The only thing that is "wrong" with this is that Mac people are not used to
do this on command line. Ben's command works.

If you insist on using graphical installer, you must select "Package
Installer" from "Packages & Data". Once there, select "Other Repository"
instead of default ("CRAN (binaries)") and enter
http://r-forge.r-project.org/ in the address slot. If you want to install
from the source instead of the provided Mac binaries, you must deselect
"Binary Format Packages". Then you can click "Get List" and select (or
search) the package and click "Install Selected". There you go...

Who said that GUI is easier to use than the command line?

Hi Liv,

are you using vnc from the Finder ("Screen Sharing"), that is, press cmd-k and type vnc://linux.server.ip ?
If so, the Screen Sharing app has an "Edit...Send Clipboard" menu item.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Broken BLAS
Message-ID: <338FCB24-FAD6-47EF-89C1-26C28847DDD7@stat.ucla.edu>

This is more on post-multiplying a matrix by a diagonal matrix (in six different ways).

The machine-comparison results from this little exercise can be explained by three factors

-- CPU speed
-- number of threads
-- BLAS library

Of the six methods, the first two use BLAS, the last four do not. For the
last four, times are determined largely by CPU speed.

For the first two methods, there are two things going on. First, BLAS in the Windows
implementation of R is faster than the vecLib BLAS on OS X. Second, on the
Mac Pro with Nehalem, for reasons unknown (bug !!) the OS decides to use a non-parellel
single-threaded BLAS. Running the same code, with the same OS and the same R, on a MacBook
or an iMac or a MacAir, does use multiple threads.  This is all
under OS X 10.6.5, by the way, using R-develop from svn. Running the same code in Parallels
emulation, using Windows R on the MacPro, uses multiple threads as well.

I cannot possibly convey how annoying this is.

Message-ID: <A883D36E-8F8C-4800-9887-F4FA60301CC6@collocations.de>

Hi everyone!

I just saw Jan de Leeuw's e-mail about his BLAS benchmarks, which is an interesting coincidence -- I've been wanting to ask the list about some inexplicable (and somewhat disappointing) matrix benchmark results on 64-bit Mac OS X with vecLib BLAS.

My problem seems to be different from Jan's, though, as the CPU load on my computer indicates that both cores are used; so it can't be an issue with using multiple threads.   That's why I'm starting a new thread.

For a little bit of background: I'm looking for the fastest method to calculate inner products between large sets of vectors and have been benchmarking various algorithms for this purpose, most of them performing a matrix multiplication M %*% t(M) in different ways.  Test were run on an early 2008 MacBook Pro with Intel Core 2 Duo, 2.5 GHz and 6 GB RAM, using R 2.11.1 on Leopard (10.5.8) and Snow Leopard (10.6.4); I also tried today's R-devel with the same results.

To my big surprise, matrix operations are _much_ slower in 64-bit R than in 32-bit R (controlled with the --arch option).  This was completely unexpected, as 64-bit code is usually a little faster than the equivalent 32-bit code (5%-10% in my experience).  Here are some benchmark results (MOPS is an estimate for million of multiply-accumulate operations per second):

As you can see, the 64-bit code is much slower than the 32-bit code especially for the (t)crossprod operation, and my beautiful (and expensive :) MacBook is even outperformed by a high-end netbook running Linux:

After some experimentation, it seems that the culprit is Apple's vecLib.  If I switch to the reference BLAS shipped with R, I get the expected slight advantage for the 64-bit code, and overall performance increases considerably:

I thought this might be a fluke of my particular hardware and software setup, but Jan's results lead me to believe that this may be a general problem with vecLib.  Has anybody else on the list observed similar behaviour?  If so, would it make sense to change the default to the reference BLAS?  In my benchmarks, it was consistently faster than vecLib (except for crossprod), but there may be other operations and situations in which vecLib performs better.


Some other remarks and observation:

 - The reference BLAS performs very poorly on crossprod() as opposed to tcrossprod(), while they're equally fast with vecLib.  If one is aware of this, it's relatively easy to work around in most situations, though (as t() is relatively cheap).

 - I've also tried the standard Ubuntu ATLAS instead of the reference BLAS, which performed very poorly at around 2000 MOPS.  Optimising BLAS libraries seems to be a tricky business ...

 - My vectors are very sparse (part of the task I'm benchmarking for).  This may have an influence on the result (if there are special optimisations for 0 entries in the BLAS libraries), but I doubt this is the case.

 - I did some benchmarks for Euclidean distances between the vectors as well, finding that dist() is an extremely slow operation -- I had been aware of this, just not how bad the situation really is.  dist() runs at about 160 MOPS, while a (numerically unstable) approximation with matrix operations is almost 8x faster.


If you want to try for yourself, you can check out the benchmark code and the sample data set I used from R-Forge:

	svn checkout svn://scm.r-forge.r-project.org/svnroot/wordspace/illustrations benchmark 

Then run the script "matrix_benchmarks.R" in the new directory benchmark/.

I'd be interested to hear about substantially different results on other Mac computers / R versions.  Has anybody got a highly optimised BLAS on the Mac?


Best wishes,
Stefan

Sweave.sty should have been installed with R, in the directory given by

file.path(R.home(), "share", "texmf")

The organization of that directory will change with the 2.12.0 release 
(becoming compliant with a TeX standard whose name I forget), so don't 
carve the path in stone.

Hi Ricardo

Sweave.sty is indeed installed with R-2.11.pkg. The installer puts stuff in two places: the R and R64 apps in the Applications directory and then creates a folder in /Library/Frameworks.  If you look in  /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.11/Resources/share/texmf you will find Sweave.sty

Confirmed: Sweave.sty is installed in that location. I've tried
http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/R-2.11.1.pkg in two MacPro boxes
running Leopard and Snow Leopard.

OK! we'll be pending on this change! With the new LyX2.0.0 (now in
alpha5 stage) release R, code chunks (R code in a LaTeX document) will 
be able to be used out of the box with any document class
(http://wiki.lyx.org/LyX/NewInLyX20). Provided R is installed, of course!

Right now, the problem is that Sweave.sty is not available for LyX
without "human" intervention. I'm not skilled enough as for
understanding what the reorganization of the directory where Sweave.sty
is installed does mean, but I will forward this message to 
lyx-devel at lists.lyx.org where people is discussing the best way of 
making Sweave.sty provided by R "visible" to LyX.

The problem is that the place where R puts the Sweave file is not part
of the search path for your tex installation.  You can fix this by
adding the path as you would add any other path, or you can use the
following in your .Rprofile which will put an absolute path inside
your generated tex document (just look at the header of the tex
document).  The absolute path means that running your tex document
through tex in order to generate say a pdf will only work on your
computer, but that might not be an issue for you.

  Sys.setenv("SWEAVE_STYLEPATH_DEFAULT" = "TRUE")

The first objective of my question is to understand why LyX 
(http://www.lyx.org/) is not able to find Sweave.sty. It is far clear 
now: LyX relies on TeX (well, in fact is a kind of front end to TeX) and 
if TeX is not able to find it, LyX won't be it either.

As said before in this thread, what we try to find is a way to get 
Sweave.sty available for LyX out of the box: one LyX and R are 
installed, no more "human" intervention will be required.

I'm also forwarding this message to lyx-devel at lists.lyx.org

Greetings!

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] png and dpi
Message-ID: <4C8A0174.7070407@ich.ucl.ac.uk>

Here are various ways of creating a png file. The dpi seems to be 
treated inconsistently.

 > quartz(width=7, height=7); plot(1:11); dev.copy2pdf()

produces a plot of 7x7 in, 2100x2100 pixels, 300 ppi. So dpi defaults to 
300 - fair enough ... But

 > quartz(width=7, height=7, dpi=72); plot(1:11); dev.copy2pdf()

also produces a plot of 7x7 in, 2100x2100 pixels, 300 ppi. So dpi=72 is 
overruled with dpi=300.

Writing directly to file produces the opposite effect:

 > quartz(width=7, height=7, type='png', dpi=300); plot(1:11); dev.off()

or

 > png(width=7, height=7, units='in', res=300, type='quartz')
 > plot(1:11); dev.off()

both produce plots of 7x7 in, 2100x2100 pixels, 72 ppi. So here dpi=300 
is overruled with dpi=72.

The plot resolution is correct throughout, but writing directly to file 
the dpi is wrong. Is there a way to force the file to have dpi=300?

I'm on R 2.11.1 GUI 1.34 Leopard build 32-bit (5589).

Thanks,

Don't know whether the following is the official procedure, but it might work:

Do you have an account on the Linux server that you can login to, using ssh (*)?
Then you can probably use 

	scp <localRscript.R> yourUserName at LinuxHost.domain:~/your/R/script/directory

to copy the file localRscript.R to the Linux machine,  
and then use something like

	ssh yourUserName at LinuxHost.domain
	cd ~/your/R/script/direcory
	R
	> source("localRscript.R")
	
You might have to enter your password at times, or you can use an authorized key (*).
If you don't want to keep the ssh connection alive, read the manual for the nohup command (*).

(*) And, of course Ask your local Linux admin for details.

Or is the server running Rserve?

hth, jochen

Hi,

I've read section 9, did the

but I still get that warning. I went to org.R-project.R to look and
the force.LANG is en_US.UTF-8 is there.

I'm using OS 10.6.4, R 2.11.1 (2010-05-31) and the file is in my own

What is wrong?

Thanks.

Message-ID: <AANLkTiktWMO+HHFLJTOUyjPr3bc_m6rZvAFV+x7nAfe9@mail.gmail.com>

Everyone,

I have a few only versions in /Library:

drwxrwxr-x  4 root  admin  136 May 13 23:46 2.10
drwxrwxr-x  3 root  admin  102 Aug  9 16:00 2.11
drwxrwxr-x  6 root  admin  204 Aug  9 16:00 2.12
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  admin    4 Aug  9 16:00 Current -> 2.12

I need to check that something worked in 2.11.x, but when I run

$  /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.11/Resources/bin/R64

R version 2.12.0 Under development (unstable) (2010-08-08 r52687)
Copyright (C) 2010 The R Foundation for Statistical Computing
ISBN 3-900051-07-0
Platform: x86_64-apple-darwin9.8.0/x86_64 (64-bit)

Note the dates on the 2.11 and 2.12 paths are both Aug  9 16:00, so
I'm guessing that the 2.12 installer over-wrote the 2.11 install.

I installed 2.11 again, did my testing, then re-installed with 2.12
pkg file dated today:

$ ls -al /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/
total 8
drwxrwxr-x  6 root  admin  204 Sep 15 12:19 .
drwxrwxr-x  8 root  admin  272 Sep 15 12:19 ..
drwxrwxr-x  4 root  admin  136 May 13 23:46 2.10
drwxrwxr-x  3 root  admin  102 Sep 15 12:19 2.11
drwxrwxr-x  6 root  admin  204 Sep 15 12:19 2.12
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  admin    4 Sep 15 12:19 Current -> 2.12

It looks like it wiped out the 2.11 install again. I know that the
labels are "Under development" and "unstable", but it is worth brining
up.

The OS version is 10.6.4.

Thanks,

Max

You can use any of the *.dmg files. I guess the latest (R 2.10.1) is probably the best ;).

Max,

please consider reading the R for Mac FAQ (most notably 12.15) and the information displayed as you install R. The latter tells you that the default is to remove your old version and instructs you how to install multiple versions in parallel if that's what you want. The former explains why you need to change the "Current" version softlink if you want to switch between versions and there is even RSwitch app for that to be had at http://r.research.att.com

Cheers,
Simon

The latter tells you that the default is to remove your old version and instructs you how to install multiple versions in parallel if that's what you want. The former explains why you need to change the "Current" version softlink if you want to switch between versions and there is even RSwitch app for that to be had at http://r.research.att.com

Hi Liv,

I use rsync to upload my scripts + data to a linux server, then ssh to start the run and rsync again to fetch results. All of this can be wrapped into a shell script. 

HTH,

Martin

Message-ID: <2E119198-6D92-4A4B-A1EE-E0A5BE1B91F1@stat.ucla.edu>

If you want your Mac to run Revolution R Enterprise, or some of the CUDA/GPU
packages that run best under Linux, then this can of course be done
by running the appropriate OS in an emulator such as Parallels 
Desktop.

Parallels now also has Parallels Mobile for the iPad, which is
basically a screen sharing app. You have a Parellels running on
a remote desktop that you login to from the iPad, and then you
start (for example) Revolution R from your iPad, and you can enter 
commands directly into the R interpreter from the iPad keyboard. 
Before the end of the year you'll also be able to print remotely.

It's still clunky, but it can be done. And it can be done over 3G as
well.

Hi Steven,

Try

abline(a = -1905/2, b = 0.5)

R is "drawing" abline(a = 0, b = 0.5) but it is entirely off the screen as the x limits are 1900 to 1910.

It appears that abline only works for b = 0 as those were your only attempts that yielded
a line within the plot frame.

I must be missing something very obvious

 data <-ts(rnorm(120,0,1),start=1900,frequency=12)
 plot(data)
 abline(a=0,b=1)

# draws nothing
abline(a=0,b=0)  #works
abline(a=1,b=0)  #works
abline(a=0,b=.5) # doesnt work

abline will only draw if b=0

apparently it's not for R otherwise you would not see that error (hint: .profile and others are NOT loaded by LS). As the error message suggests you can also provide the full path  using --with-gdal-config - have you tried that?

Cheers,
Simon

Yes I did with the same result. But now I realized that

Xcode is available for pretty much all OS X versions so you must be looking at the wrong one. If you have OS X 10.5 you want Xcode 3.1.4 and for OS X 10.6 you want Xcode 3.2.3 or 3.2.4. They will be on your PATH automatically once you install them.

From the XCode download page you need to go to "Developer Downloads", and then select Developer Tools, and they are all there.

Hi Adrian,

I just tried out your plot code as written, except for adding the first
three lines below to generate x and Y data, and the legend prints
correctly. So I agree this points to a font problem.


   Y <- matrix(1:28, nrow=7)
   x <- 1:7
   ttext="plot title"

   matplot(x,Y,xlab="N(t)",ylab="log{N(t+1)/N(t)}",main=ttext,
   type=c("p","l","l","l","l"),pch=21,col=c("black","blue","green","red",
   "purple"),lty=1,lwd=2,family="sans")

   legend("topright",c("Data","DI model","Ricker","Theta Logistic","Allee"),
   pch=c(21,-1,-1,-1),col=c("black","blue","green","red","purple"),
   lty=c("blank","solid","solid","solid","solid"),lwd=2,plot=TRUE)

Adrian,

missing fonts have cropped up a few times - so far the most common cause were broken fonts - please check your Font Book for duplicate or broken fonts (most specifically Arial). Please let me know if that was the cause.

Thanks,
Simon

But do you have a working Arial and Helvetica when you look in your font book? Sometime the fonts can be broken ...

Message-ID: <6B1EDD98-52E3-4061-BD23-889392D9B83A@sticksoftware.com>

  Hi all.  I recently made myself a .Rprofile file, and I have just discovered two oddities with this in the R GUI.  On the one hand, when I do "Clear Workspace" (from the Workspace menu) it doesn't clear out the .First function that my .Rprofile defined, which is surprising.  On the other hand, it also doesn't re-run my .Rprofile, which I would have expected, since to me the point of "Clear Workspace" is to give a fresh workspace identical to the one I get when I quit and re-launch the R GUI app.
  I don't know enough about the internals of R to assert that these are bugs; but I can say that it's annoying to me that Clear Workspace gives me a workspace in which my .Rprofile stuff is not defined.  What's the recommended way to deal with this?

I'd say not clearing .First is a bug: the menu item executes

                 [[REngine mainEngine] executeString: @"rm(list=ls())"];

and that should be rm(list=ls(all=TRUE)).

However, if you ask the workspace to be cleared, it should be clear. 
The unanswered question is why you are using .Rprofile to create 
objects in the workspace -- sounds as if you want to put them in an 
attached environment (e.g. via a package) -- and people normally work 
hard to ensure that .Rprofile leaves no objects there.

Beyond that, one could question the need for a 'Clear Workspace' menu 
item.  It does not start a new session and there are some many 
stateful variables (e.g. the search() path) not part of the workspace 
that starting a new session is much more common.

On the one hand, when I do "Clear Workspace" (from the Workspace menu) it doesn't clear out the .First function that my .Rprofile defined, which is surprising.  On the other hand, it also doesn't re-run my .Rprofile, which I would have expected, since to me the point of "Clear Workspace" is to give a fresh workspace identical to the one I get when I quit and re-launch the R GUI app.

  Fair enough.

The unanswered question is why you are using .Rprofile to create objects in the workspace -- sounds as if you want to put them in an attached environment (e.g. via a package) -- and people normally work hard to ensure that .Rprofile leaves no objects there.

  Well, making a package for what amounts to a couple of aliases and utility functions seems like overkill, and in any case I haven't the faintest idea how to make a package.  I just want a couple of small custom things to always be available for me in R.  I got this idea from a website that showed somebody's .Rprofile file, which defined loads upon loads of custom functions; maybe that other person led me in a bad direction, but it's not immediately obvious to me why doing this is a Bad Idea, and other example .Rprofiles on the web often seem to do the same.  Isn't the whole point of the .Rprofile file to customize your default R environment to fit your needs?

  Starting a new session sounds more useful than clearing the workspace, I agree.  I'd be happy if the "Clear Workspace" menu command morphed into a "Reset Session" menu command, or some such, defined as "give me a session/workspace/etc. identical to what I would get if I quit and relaunched R GUI."  I would actually just quit and relaunch the app, except 1) that's slow, and 2) that closes all my open source file windows, which is a hassle.
