I would like to apologize for cross-posting this message.  But I
realized that one of my questions may be more appropriate for the
SIG-Mac mailing list rather than the R-devel mailing list.  You may
wish to ignore the other parts of the email.  My question is the
following:

"I can't seem to reproduce the speed of the 2.11.1 reference BLAS
library. ?What compiler, which version of the compiler, and what flags
are used when an [OS X] R binary is distributed? My test machine is a
Mac Pro, so 32-bit x86 architecture."

Hi,

I saw on the mailing list and in the NEWS file that some unsafe math
transformations were disabled for the reference BLAS implementation
that is used in R. ?We have a set of performance tests for the OpenMx
library, and some of the tests have a x3-10 slowdown in R 2.12.0
versus 2.11.1. ?When I copy the shared library libRblas.0.dylib from
the 2.11.1 installation into the 2.12.0 installation, the slowdown
goes away. ?It seems reasonable that BLAS should conform to IEEE
requirements. ?For the purposes of our library, we are considering two
options but I need some advice on both choices:

1) Compile the reference BLAS implementation with unsafe optimizations
and include it as a part of the OpenMx library. ?I can't seem to
reproduce the speed of the 2.11.1 reference BLAS library. ?What
compiler, which version of the compiler, and what flags are used when
an R binary is distributed? My test machine is a Mac Pro, that may
change the answer.

2) Is there any support for adding a libRblas.unsafe.dylib shared
library in the R installation, much like libRblas.veclib.dylib is
currently included in OS X binaries? Then we could just change the
OpenMx shared library to use the unsafe library when we give it to
users. ?We currently change the OpenMx shared library to use the
reference blas implementation, because it is faster than the veclib
implementation for small matrices.

Thank you!

The current build flags for i386 are listed in
https://svn.r-project.org/R-dev-web/trunk/QA/Simon/R-build/conf.leopard-i386

They did not change recently so they were the same for 2.11.1. The compiler used is gcc-4.2 from Xcode 3.1.4 (R is built on OS X 10.5.8) with the corresponding Fortran form the tools page.

More below.

Although it would be possible technically, it would mean to include Rblas built by a different version of R which doesn't sound right (the flags are set by configure so there is no easy way to reproduce it in the current R without manual intervention). However, I'm considering adding some alternatives (such as ATLAS for example) in the build and a tool to change the BLAS used - possibly as a separate package.

To get back to your problem - did you try the single threaded ATLAS for your problem? The optimizations are not necessarily just for large matrices - in fact ATLAS has several paths depending on the size of the problem. (I'm traveling at the moment so can't run any tests)

However, as John pointed out it is pretty much impossible to get a general solution because any benchmarks are very limited to a certain problem and size yet the mechanisms involved are far more complex (and as I was pointing out for the recently discussed speed patches - seeming clear optimization to increase speed can in reality be slower that the untouched code depending on compilers, flags and architecture).

Cheers,
Simon

Thank you, I can run off and do some more tests with this information.
 I think the culprit on my development machine is that Xcode needs to
be upgraded and then I can use -mtune=core2.  I have one small
follow-up question.  I thought the compilation flags for building
src/extra/blas had changed from version 2.12.0 to 2.11.1.  But you
suggest maybe they haven't changed?

I did try ATLAS and did not see performance improvements.  But that
attempt was without -mtune=core2.

That alone could explain you performance issue since you gcc is apparently way too old - possibly nothing to do with flags but just gcc capabilities.

I did not change anything as far as the configure flags go.

My apologies.  I finally noticed that the source files in
src/extra/blas had changed.  I had been looking at the diff file for a
few days, until I remembered that the "c" at the beginning of a line
signifies the line as a comment.  OK, so the game plan for our
specific R package will be to take the reference BLAS source from
2.11.1 and stick it in our package.  Thanks to Simon and everyone else
for all their help.

Hi all, I'm new to any programming and I've been doing some stuff in R  
the last couple of month, I hope you can help me here?

I'm using lm() to do a 12 degree polynomial fit to a series of data  
x,y. Then I built a polynomial using the coefficients given by coef()  
function (replacing any NA by a 0), and evaluate it in x.

My problem comes when I replace the coef(p12)[ ] with their actual

and not even the shape of the functions are alike when i plot them.

can anyone give me a clue of what's happening and how to fix it?

This does really look more like an Rhelp question.

I am wondering what would happen if you tried:

fit12 <- lm(y ~ poly(x), degree=12)

p12 <- predict(fit12)

plot(p12)

(Untested in absence of reproducible data.)

You seem to missing an operator between 2 and (, and I am guessing you  
meant to type "*" or ":") but it is not clear SINCE YOU HAVE NOT  
DESCRIBED THE PROBLEM WELL. (And you have not posted the exact error  
message either.)

Also check FAQ for description of problems related to the hierarchy of  
arithmetic operators in R (I don't actually remember a FAQ nubmber for  
this one but it is "frequently asked":

So have you checked at the ends of your ranges to see if these indices  
are meaningful? What is length(x) and would it be meaningful to  
request x[2-1 -3]? What is x[-2]  (or perhaps x[1-3] ) , after all? Or  
x[length(x)

More likely that the extremes would raise "out of range" problems than  
the "interior" indices.

Better problem description, better punctuation,  and posting to rhelp.

Yes,  a numerical problem. The two NA in the coefs make this a certainty. Using (and understanding poly) will solve the problem. However in most cases using splines will produce something closer to the result you want. While a polynomial will fit the points well, it is likely to do ridiculous things between the points.

Further questions should be directed to Rhelp or a general stats list.

Hi Sandy,

Why don't you usw runmean() of the caTools package??
In the see also section of the help for runmean() there are various other possibilities given.

Good Luck
Gerald

Also rollmean or rollapply in package zoo. Eg:

library(zoo)
rollmean(as.zoo(1:25), 5)

G'day all,

I am having a problem with a function in surveillance package when trying to use one function on my mac (either GUI or commandline). It works fine on FreeBSD, and the contributor uses Linux or windows, so I thought I might ask here first - my apologies in advance. Many of the package functions work absolutely fine on all three.

Using the spatio-temporal cluster detection function stcd, and using the example in the help file, the final command takes about 1 second to return a result on FreeBSD (output of sessionInfo() first):

All the commands run fine, except that the final one does not finish, and after an initial flash of enthusiasm, R ticks along between about 3 and 15% of CPU chewing up as much memory as it can. I have attached a sample at the very bottom of this email, taken before I killed it off.

I realise this could be a package function, but I know almost nothing about what goes on under the R hood, so if this helps to find a problem in the package I am very happy to switch to go back to the package authors with some help.

Thank you for your help,

Just tried. It worked. Nothing much more to say because I got no errors. If you have a simple example I can run I can test if the package *works* rather than just install cleanly.

Hi Steven,

Are you still having problems?

I'd be surprised if R-2.12 itself has anything to do with the problems
you're seeing, but assuming 2.11 is still on your system, you can
switch to it easily by using Rswitch, that you can find here:

http://r.research.att.com/#other

It assumes 2.11 was installed via the normal R installers, ie. it lives in:

/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.11

A few Q's for you:

(1) Did you reinstall your R libraries for 2.12 from scratch (good
idea) , or did you copy them over from your 2.11 install (bad idea)

(2) Are you using R from R.app or from the terminal?

(2a) When you run are from the Terminal, does it still exhibit this behavior?
(2b) How about if you start R with the --vanilla flag?, eg:

$ R --vanilla

If you want to completely uninstall R 2.12 and start from scratch, you
can do that from the terminal, too:

$ sudo rm -Rf /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.12

Hope that helps,
-steve

btw - I don't think "MAC" needs to be capitalized ... it's not an acronym ;-)

In case it helps with diagnosis: I don't replicate this behaviour on
my system, running OSX 10.6.5 and R 2.11.1. I also updated to R 2.12.0
and still failed to replicate the reported behaviour.

Maybe you have some "ghost" data file that are being loaded on R startup?

Look to see if there is a file named ".RData" in your home directory.

What do you see when you run this command from the terminal?

$ ls -ald ~/.R*

If you see an .RData file there, either delete it, or rename it to
something else since R will try to load this file if it finds it there
(unless you start R with --vanilla, or --no-restore-data)

Hi,

Don't forget to cc r-sig-mac to keep correspondence, you'll likely get
quicker + more informed suggestions if the whole community can see
what's going on.

I'm guessing not ... weird that `R --vanilla` worked for a bit, then stopped.

Also, these errors from another email sent earlier:

It's weird that R is fishing into your fink install for something ...
maybe someone else will be able to make some sense out of it.

Dear users,

I've seen a few problems on this list related to R2.12 on Mac. It looks 
to me that the Mac release is not really stable yet, or is it? Maybe 
it's just a few instances and most of you have no problems at all with it.

Therefore, I've kept my R2.11 on my Mac. Would you advise to upgrade or 
to wait some time? And if I should/can upgrade, do you have any 
recommendations regarding how to do it correctly (that are not included 
in the FAQ)?

Thanks for the advice!
Ivan

I installed it yesterday and had three "moments" when I thought things  
had gone wrong, none of which proved to be enduring problems.  During  
the install process using the downloaded bundle from the ATT site I  
noticed that the progress bar had stopped for what seemed to be an  
unreasonable period and realized that I had a running instance of R.  
Quit()-ting appeared to allow progress to resume. (So my first bit of  
potentially glaringly obvious advice would be to shutdown all  
instances of R before the install. I couldn't find this bit of advice  
on the Install directions but it is certainly possible that the  
authors thought to too obvious to mention.)

The next puzzle was when I checked the installation of the R.app and  
R64.app GUI's. I assumed (wrongly as I eventually figured out) that  
they would have a more recent date than 2009 when viewed in the  
Applications folder. It turned out that they should (still) be version  
1.35 and that the new ones looked just like my old ones and work just  
fine.

The third "moment(s)" was when reinstalling package rms and dependent  
packages. I first tried installing the binary versions from my CRAN  
mirror and nothing seemed to be happening in hte time frame to which I  
have been accustomed. I "Force quit". I then restarted and installed  
from source. There was a very long period of no console activity, but  
I couldn't see any burning need to "Force quit" and I went away and  
came back 10 minutes later, to find the compliation process begun and  
then watch it run throught o completion and notice of success. Looking  
up at the intial portion of the console massages I discovered that  
about 20 packages were installed, so my initial impatience cause me to  
prematurely interupt what was probably a normal pause for the packages  
to be downloaded.

Normal behavior seems to have been restored after a few temporary  
moments of cluelessness on my part.

David, thank you for your answer.
If I understand you right, it looks like one should be patient during 
the installation process!

When I installed packages for R2.10, I ended up installing the 
dependencies manually one by one or else it was always installing many 
unnecessary packages (I guess they are unnecessary because I've never 
installed all of them on Windows), making the process last for ages. 
Looks like it still persists with R2.12

Regarding the packages, I thought that this website 
http://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_summary.html provided an 
up-to-date check of the packages, but I'm not sure it does. The packages 
were only tested with the pre-release for MacOSX and some packages (even 
the basics like plyr and reshape) show errors (which I don't really 
understand). Maybe I should just try out or contact the maintainer of 
the packages I need.

And since you've upgraded, you don't have any speed problem, as reported 
I think twice on the list?

I've been using R-2.12 since day 0 and don't have any issues to report.

I've also stopped using R from the GUI for a long time now (I only run
it via the terminal, or through emacs/terminal), so if there are
problems with using that for an extended period of time, I wouldn't
know (I'm guessing there aren't, though).

Keep in mind that you can keep R-2.11 on your machine *and* install
R-2.12. If for some reason you think R-2.12 isn't stable enough for
you, you can switch back to R-2.11 with Rswitch, which you can find
here:

I second that (and since I do quite a lot of development on my MacBook 
Air, I was using pre-2.12.0 from ca day -30).

Installing R and updating installed packages went smoothly on both computers (iMac,MacBook Pro).

I haven't encountered any problems using R.
I use both the GUI and the R bundle of TextMate (latest version is 1.5.10 and all is well).

/sw/...   is a Fink thing.
Somewhere in your .profile  Fink "things" are being set.
When you open a terminal and do "set" what do you get?
What does echo $PATH show?
etc.,...


I did an otool  -L on /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.12/Resources/lib/libR.dylib l and got this

libR.dylib:
        /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.12/Resources/lib/libR.dylib (compatibility version 2.12.0, current version 2.12.0)

IF you are using a CRAN binary version of R, it is strange how fink is
involved at all.  You must have a messed up system

My best guess is that DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH or LD_LIBRARY_PATH has been
set (you can do
  echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH
in the terminal).  Unset those variables, and proceed.

`echo` in lowercase, not capitals. But anyway, we already see the
problem from your previous email. I guess this was what was in your
~/.profile file, or something?

Your DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH is, in fact, hosing you.

Comment out that line.

Or, you can temporary move /sw to /sw2 to get fink out of the way for
now, and see what is the what.

This line screws up your entire system.  You sometimes see people on
various email lists recommend doing stuff like this, but this is a
specific place where OS X is very different from Linux.  In principle,
this could also mess with your other applications.

However, you also need to figure out how that got set in your GUI
(check by doing
Sys.getenv("DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH")
) and you will need to fix that as well in case fixing .profile does
not fix the GUI.

Yeah remove that

But I don't even get why you are doing this.  On a mac (at least with
a newer version of the OS like Tiger or newer) RCurl works out of the
box.

So what you do it
  remove offending line in bashrc
  do a grep in you home folder to check you don't have other offending
lines including either LD_LIBRARY_PATH or DYLD_LIBRARYPATH
  cd /etc and do a recursive grep for LD_LIBRARY_PATH, and see if it
hits anything.
  restart Terminal
  start R and verify it works

Now, after this you start the _GUI_ and do the Sys.getenv thing.  The
GUI works differently from terminal R in this case.  If the offending
value is still there, you might want to have a look in
  .MacOS/environment.plist
There might be a similar line somewhere

Finally, write 100 times "I will not do random things to my system I
read on random websites".  Ok, that is a little tough, but you do
realize this is all your own doing, right.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] restoring R 2.11.1 while keeping R 2.12
Message-ID: <loom.20101116T170148-928@post.gmane.org>

Hi,

What's the cleanest way to restore R  2.11.1 without clobbering R 2.12?
I know that pkgutil can be used to forget old receipts in order to upgrade
to a higher version of R while retaining the lower one and then Rswitch
can be used to choose the one to run.  But, this didn't seem to work in
the reverse direction, i.e., I have R 2.12 patched installed and I tried
to install R 2.11.1 after running pkgutil.  Rswitch did not record that
R 2.11.1 had been installed and the GUI bombed out on startup (I probably
have to install the R 2.11.1 GUI separately).  

Do I have to uninstall R 2.12 before reinstalling R 2.11.1 and then do
use pkgutils, or is there a simpler way?

The reason for wanting to do this is that I need to process some documents 
using Sweave that use the cacheSweave package, which currently is not
working correctly with R 2.12, even though an update has been promised 
imminently.

Thank you.

Ken

Installing R 2.12.0 did not overwrite my old 2.11 folder in :
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.11

RSwitch is able to launch (some) old versions, but I am not sure about  
all. (I now have a collection going back to 2.7)

My versions go back to 2.3 on this particular laptop, but that's not
the point.  To be able to switch between versions with Rswitch, 
the pkgutil --forget etc. must be run prior to upgrading as described
in one of the startup screens of the installer.  This has worked for me,
too, in the past, but it didn't seem to work in trying to reinstall a previous
version and I'm wondering if there is an easy way to do that, or if I missed
something in the way I tried.  Thanks.

Ken

Dear all,

Is there a way to get errors (especially) and comments pretty printed in the GUI?

Often pasting a chunk of code, an error can go unseen, and it would be nice if the console could pretty print them as does the editor?

Thanks!,

PS: Second, if anyone wants to implement a filter box in the history panel (i.e., the user can type in some text (ideally regex) and the list is filtered to display only elements that match the typing), I offer a ?75 reward :-)

I just downloaded and installed R 2.12.0 patched onto my 2008 MacPro running MacOS X 10.6.5.

It seems to be all good with one exception:

When I select 'Packages & Data -> Data Manager', I get a blank Data Manager window and the following in the console:
Error in help(dt[i], package = pkg[i], htmlhelp = TRUE) : 
  unused argument(s) (htmlhelp = TRUE)
In addition: Warning messages:
1: In data(package = .packages(all.available = TRUE)) :
  datasets have been moved from package 'base' to package 'datasets'
2: In data(package = .packages(all.available = TRUE)) :
  datasets have been moved from package 'stats' to package 'datasets'

Any suggestions?

Thanks

  This is not appropriate for this list (MacOS special interest group),
please post it to the general R help list (r-help at r-project.org).

  This is because the Mac version was built under 2.9 and the Windows
version was built under 2.10.1.

  Write to the authors and ask for a source (.tgz) version?

  Run the package on windows, dump the R code to new .R files, and
create your own package which you can then rebuild on the Mac?  If you
haven't built packages before this will take a bit of work (see the R
Extensions manual), but if you really need these functions ...

I would suggest going to the page from which you downloaded the software, presumably http://labs.fhcrc.org/pepe/dabs/software.html and click on the contact tab and tell them your problem. Either they will rebuild or supply source.

All,

  No matter what I do (e.g., complete re-install of R and then Rcmdr (with dependencies=TRUE)), Rcmdr will not launch on just one of my computers (all running 10.6.5): it crashes (R becomes ``non-responding" as it loads Tcl).  It also happened on OS X 10.6.4 (last week).  The computer is a two-week-old MacBook Pro.  Every other of my Intel Macs (all older), including 6 mos old otherwise identical MacBook Pros show no such problem.  Suggestions?

Does Simon's build of Tcl/Tk work on its own?  Have you installed the 
correct version?

It seem pretty unlikely that the issue is in Rcmdr per se (and BTW, as 
the posting guide says there is no 'R 2.12' and asks you not to use 
the word 'crash').

If the issue is loading package tcltk and you have Xcode installed, 
you can debug that by running R at the command line under gdb (R -d 
gdb) and interrupt it to see where the problem is.

I don't, but it is reproducible on the Leopard flavor .... although I  
don't seem to have the "patched" designation despite only upgrading a  
couple of days ago.

(And it's not a Mac-specific question so would be better next time to  
post to rhelp.)

Does anyone know if it is possible to run Rcmdr in Aqua TclTk (e.g., ActiveStates TclTk 8.6)? Could any replies be sent to me directly since I don't subscribe to the list?

Well, there is no 'TclTk 8.6' yet (it's a beta), but 8.5.9 worked last 
time I tried.  However, you will have to build R to use it, and use 
(command-line) R and not R.app (the GUI).

Is building R from source 'a lot of work'?  If you think so, I wonder 
what you would call the amount of work the developers do to bring you 
R ... and how you have shown your appreciation for that work.

On a Mac the Aqua Tcl/Tk 8.5 is a lot nicer (it was 8.5 that got the 
ttk widget set), but it is pretty much incompatible with R.app.
(The X11 widgets on my Mac look much uglier than on my Linux desktop, 
for example.)

I notice the new 8.6 Aqua Tcl/Tk uses Cocoa rather than the old Carbon APIs.  Perhaps Simon has some comments about whether this might make it possible to play better with the Cocoa R.app GUI.

Dear all,

To elaborate slightly, Roger's system freezes when he tries to load the
tcltk package independently of the Rcmdr, via library(tcltk), and he does
have X11 and Tcl/Tk for X Windows installed.

 John

Thanks much. It sounds like this is a lot of work just to make RCommander look a little nicer. You're right, I meant TclTk 8.5. Aqua TclTk 8.4 had problems.

Since the market is closed saturdays, sundays and holidays,
the dataset has gaps. I need to insert rows (with dates
but all other columns blank) so that the date
column in the dataset will have all dates on the calendar?

Is there a simple solution using only strptime, and for loops?

Hi i was wondering whether anyone ever compiles R against Intels MKL fr Snow Leopard
and if yes what were the results and if you have any advise on how to start ...

The R-admin has the necessary details and if you read the archives of this mailing list you will even find a more elegant solution how to simply plug MKL into CRAN R:
https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-mac/2010-October/007767.html

[That said, I find MKL slower than ATLAS on my machine so IMHO it's not worth the effort (and cost).]

Simon

Well, it's not our to resolve - the problem is with Apple.

Sure, CRAN R comes with shared BLAS so you can simply switch to ATLAS or R BLAS (see R-admin for general directions and this list for specific binaries).

Even old R should compile for 64-bit out of the box -- if you set the flags correctly. The 64-bit support for OS X is there ever since Tiger. Can you supply details? (i.e. how did you try to compile, what did not work etc)

I'm not aware of any because such an old R predates SL ...

Hi,

Not sure if this is the most elegant solution, but here it is.

You do not tell us the date format you use (chron, as.Date, other?). Regardless, you should be able to create a vector containing the sequence of the dates for a given year. Make it a data.frame.

If you use the Date class, it is easy:

y2003 = data.frame(DATE=seq(as.Date("2003-01-01"), as.Date("2003-12-31"), by=1))

then I'd do a merge:

alldays = merge(yourData, y2003, by="DATE", all.x=T, all.y=T)

Message-ID: <8860749C-5410-49AF-A7F3-393108529A45@r-project.org>

Apparently the latest update to Snow Leopard (10.6.5) removes necessary header files from the system Java installation. They are now only available in the corresponding Xcode SDKs. What does that mean?


* If you are using binaries from CRAN, there is nothing to worry about and you can ignore this e-mail.



* If you are compiling packages against the JavaVM from sources (such as rJava), you will need to point the compilers to the new location of the headers.

For example if you want to use the 10.6 SDK you'll have to use:
JAVA_CPPFLAGS=-I/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.6.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Headers

You have two options: you can re-run javareconf with JAVA_CPPFLAGS specified, i.e. (the command is all on one line!):
JAVA_CPPFLAGS=-I/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.6.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Headers R CMD javareconf

this will configure R with the correct flags. Alternatively, you can set JAVA_CPPFLAGS before installing the packages in question if you don't want to touch the R Java configuration.

Note: the above assumes you installed Xcode in the default location "/Developer" - adjust accordingly if you used a custom location.


Cheers,
Simon
