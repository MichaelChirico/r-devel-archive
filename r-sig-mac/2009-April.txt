Hi all

I need your help. I am writing code in the editor window for R.app,  
but when I write something like a^ (not sure of the correct technical  
term) the application hangs, and I can't write anymore. It's happening  
only with the symbol ^

Thanks,

Angel

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] suggestion to fix undo behaviour in R.app's console
Message-ID: <840A52B3-EF1C-4094-AA50-119F23F01C38@eva.mpg.de>

Dear Simon, dear all,

here is my tiny suggestion to improve the undo behaviour in R's  
console after auto-pairing "" () etc.:

In RTextView.m around line 208 (Mac-GUI-1.27):

case '\'':
	if (!complement) {
		complement = @"\'";
		acCheck = YES;
		if ([self parserContextForPosition:r.location] != pcExpression) break;
	}

	// register the next pairing procedure to the undo manager better
	[self shouldChangeTextInRange:[self selectedRange]  
replacementString:complement];

	SLog(@"RTextView: open bracket chracter %c", ck);
	[super keyDown:theEvent];
	{
		r = [self selectedRange];
		if (r.location != NSNotFound) {


[self shouldChangeTextInRange:[self selectedRange]  
replacementString:complement];
will register the next changes a bit better.
The return value of that function is ignored but it could be used as:

if([self shouldChangeTextInRange:[self selectedRange]  
replacementString:complement])
... do it
else
... print error - not editable


Cheers,

--Hans

Message-ID: <0E7C5030-1E62-41E2-A2F3-CFD4A8D5C0E1@gmx.net>

Dear list,

I encountered a problem in the combination of Textmate and the SWeave  
bundle: when I start "Sweave, typeset & View", the .Rnw-file is  
processed, but the log window shows "Error: PDF file not written to  
disk" and the tex-file is not processed.

However, the sweaving was successful, as a valid .tex-file is in the  
same folder which can be typesetted without problem.
So, in general it works, I just want to avoid the extra step of  
opening the .tex-file and would like to see my pdf directly from  
SWeave-Bundle.

Did anyone encounter the same problem / any suggestions for solutions?

Best regards,
Felix

Message-ID: <7794E886-853D-4F4C-974C-5FDF307C7CB7@exeter.ac.uk>

Dear Mac and R users,


I've tried several times without much success to replace the default  
font in the graphs produced in R. Ideally, I would use the Myriad Pro  
font that lives in the font manager (but if there are restrictions,  
any other example would do).

I followed all the help pages in ?Devices, ?quartzFonts, ? 
postscriptFonts, ?Cairo, ?pdf ... including what seems to be a  
slightly out-of-date tutorial on Paul Murrell's webpage and a few  
inconclusive or broken examples in the archives. I'd like to ask if  
Mac users could help me figure out a working example for the following  
task,

- I want a pdf output (whether Cairo, pdf, quartz, postscript + post- 
precessing)

- I use some symbols (integral, greek letters, say) : do they need to  
be from a specific font?

- labels, titles, numbers should all be of the same font family

- I use both grid (ggplot2 and lattice) and base graphics

so the example would be,

> library(ggplot2)
>
> pdf( family = "Myriad Pro")
>
> print( qplot(1,1) + xlab(expression(integral(alpha,beta, infinity))))
>
> dev.off()


Many thanks for any advice,

baptiste

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] short-cut feature for getting help for the current word
	in the Console (CTRL+H)
Message-ID: <3B2D438B-B1E1-4A41-A349-B4E395EAA7AD@eva.mpg.de>

Dear Simon, dear all,

it's often the case that one types a command and needs some help  
immediately. The default workaround is to type the command in question  
into the upper-right search field. In order to simplify it here my  
suggestion:

[ | := caret position]

 > mean(|)
 > |c
 > data.frame|
 > data.|frame
 > c(me|an())

press CTRL+H to look for the current R command in the docs given by  
the caret position or if a selection is given take the content of that  
selection to look for it (mean, c, data.frame, data.frame, mean).

Attached is the method -(NSString*)getCurrentCommandForCaretPosition  
for RTextView.m.
In addition one has to provide:

#import "HelpManager.h"

at the beginning of RTextView.m



Inside of the keyDown: method one calls it via:

// ^h for help
if ([rc isEqual:@"h"] && (modFlags&(NSShiftKeyMask|NSControlKeyMask| 
NSAlternateKeyMask|NSCommandKeyMask))==NSControlKeyMask) {
	NSString* curWord = [self getCurrentCommandForCaretPosition];
	if(curWord)
		[[HelpManager sharedController] showHelpFor:curWord];
	return;
}


Cheers,

--Hans

I have seen this, at least on occasion, but only when
the circumflex is typed on the last line of the editor window.
I can't give a reprodicible example because as I indicated,
it seems to be an intermittent problem, so will be much
more difficult to track down.  My solution has been to
save the file, close the window and re-open the file.
Hitting ESC has unfrozen the window, but with the
loss of the cursor, which is disorienting so the save/reopen
strategy seems better.  It doesn't happen very often so
given there is a simple recovery strategy, I'm not bothered
by a quirk in an otherwise very handy editor.  Typing extra blank lines
at the end of the file seems to help, too.  I can't say whether
that is superstition, however.

Message-ID: <49D49004.5030602@carleton.ca>

Hi:
I sent this to R-Help a few days ago but got no response.
Can anyone here advise me?

With R for Mac on OS X:
when looking at the help system screens, it does not seem to be possible
to search within them.
For example, when looking at a long help page (e.g. for par) I often
want to search for a particular
parameter. But I don't see how. I just have to scroll and search by eye.
Is there a better way?

Without search, the usefulness of long files is much reduced, and I end 
up looking at the same
page on the web instead, because there I can search the page using the 
web browser.

Thanks
Robt

Message-ID: <0D57C92D2BD3C24ABA05093F55D3EC059A84F8@EX-BE07.ohsu.edu>

Bear R-experts,

Sorry if my question is too trivial.

I am using ssh to access and run R on a 64-bit Mac machines from my windows machine.
But I find that the tab-completion does not work when I tried.

For example, on my windows machine, I can type tab to get a full name of a specific object.

>ls()
[1]	data1		func1		data3

>fun ##<tab>
>func1	##it completes the name of the object automatically

It does not work on the Mac machine when I use R as a terminal tool.

I checked the following R website, do not have any clue though.
5.5 What does TAB completion do?
http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/rw-FAQ.html#What-does-TAB-completion-do_003f


Any suggestion and comment are welcome and appreciated!

Best Regards,
PingHsun

I suspect that you have compiled your own version of R and you did not  
use readline. I would suggest using the official Leopard binary from
http://r.research.att.com/
which uses readline and supports code completion.

Hi Simon,

Thanks for the reply.
I did complie my own version of R in my home dir of the Mac since I do not have the root privilege to install anything involved writing actions on /etc/ , /bin/, or /lib/.

I followed the instruction of the following two web-pages
http://r.research.att.com/building.html and
http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/RMacOSX-FAQ.html  bullet 2.1.3

Here is my configuration and make:

## configure
$./configure SHELL='/bin/bash' \
r_arch=x86_64 \
CC="gcc -arch x86_64 -std=gnu99" \
CXX="g++ -arch x86_64" \
OBJC="gcc -arch x86_64" \
F77="gfortran -arch x86_64" \
FC="gfortran -arch x86_64" \
--prefix=$HOME \
--with-system-zlib \
--with-blas='-framework vecLib' --with-lapack

## make
$make -j4 && \
make check && \
make CPPFLAGS=-DNEED_EXTERN_PC

## install
$make install

I thought I have complied/configured readline. Does anything look not right above?
By the way, the Mac's OS is Leopard.
And I forgot to mention that when I type the tab in R console only,
it does come up "./" followed by the sub-directories under the current directory.

Thanks,
PingHsun

The above CPPFLAGS are for readline, not for R. The compilation and  
installation of readline must be done *before* you configure R (see  
the FAQ).

Is there any plugin in quicksilver.app to source files in R? Ideally,  
when a directory is open with finder.app, It would be a good solution  
(fast) to source files with quicksilver.

Colleagues,

R 2.8.1 in OS X 10.5.6

When I open a quartz window:
	quartz(title="some text")
the title of the window appears as:
	some text [*]
i.e., R appends a bracket-asterisk-bracket

When I open a second window with the same name, the appended text does  
not appear.

Questions:
1.  What controls that appended text?
2.  Can I suppress it?

The asterisk denotes that the given Quartz device window is active  
(i.e. it is the current graphics device) you cannot suppress it.
FWIW: Your description is not quite correct - [*] appears for the  
first quartz window you create and it also appears on any new window  
you create, but at the same time it disappears from the first one. It  
will also disappear when you open another (non-quartz) device in which  
case none of the windows will have an asterisk.

Simon

Hi Simon,

I tried both installing the readline in my home dir and asking my system admin to install it for me, but none of these works out. We downloaded the readline-6.0 from GUN, and used the configure/make install described in http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/RMacOSX-FAQ.html 
Sec. 2.1.3

The configure seems running well, no error messages at least, but the following error messages popped up when we were trying to install it.



make[1]: Nothing to be done for `all'.
( cd examples ; make  DESTDIR= install )
/bin/sh ../support/mkdirs /usr/local/share/readline

It looks like the installation was trying to mv/change names of files, but it failed due to no such file or directory. Though I am not sure what these files are.

Any thoughts/suggestions are welcome.

Thanks,
PingHsun

The above CPPFLAGS are for readline, not for R. The compilation and installation of readline must be done *before* you configure R (see the FAQ).

Can you, please, be more precise what you mean by "works out"?

Those are benign - readline is just trying to make a backup of the old  
installation just in case there is one.

Message-ID: <BD249E23-04B8-4A17-9B03-15BC6ECE9B3A@r-project.org>

I would like to remind everyone that we are in the final week of the  
beta testing of R 2.9.0, so please test the binaries now! There are  
installers for both the Tiger (32-bit) and Leopard (32-bit and 64-bit)  
binaries at
http://R.research.att.com/

Reporting bugs right *after* the release is pointless - that's why we  
are providing beta and rc builds, so please test them well before  
4/17! Post any issues you have with it here.

Thanks,
Simon

Sorry I can't test this directly since I'm in the middle of doing some  
analysis and don't want to install 2.9 and have something explode. But  
it seems like I've hit a bug in R in general (I'm primarily on a mac,  
but just tested on one of your linux servers (also R 2.8.1), and the  
same is happening).

R> p2 <- list(x=rnorm(500), main='bug?', col='orange', type='l')
R> do.call(plot, p2)

You see that all of the data points are *written* on the graphics  
device.

if x are ints, I don't get this problem:

R> p3 <- list(x=1:500, main='bug?', col='orange', type='l')
R> do.call(plot, p3)

If you have all ints + 1 double, the problem appears:

R> p4 <- list(x=c(1:500, .5), main='bug?', col='orange', type='l')
R> do.call(plot,p4)

Is this a known bug, or am I doing something boneheaded?

This is not a bug (and nothing to do with the subject line).  You need 
to set 'ylab', e.g.

p2 <- list(x=rnorm(500), main='bug?', col='orange', type='l', ylab="")

Why?  Because the default is the deparse of 'x', and that is a long 
string.

Hmm, you mean their numeric values are written as the y label,

They are still written as the y label, in a compact form.  Nothing to 
do with being 'ints', rather a colon sequence.

I'm not sure this is specific to R2.9 or to the R.app GUI,

quartzFonts(myriad=quartzFont(c("MyriadPro-Regular", "MyriadPro-Bold",
"Myriad Pro-It", "Myriad Pro-BoldIt")))
hist(rnorm(1000), family="myriad") # looks fine on-screen

then try to save the quartz window manually to a file (cmd-S) results  
in a crash,

*** caught segfault ***
address 0x0, cause 'unknown'

Possible actions:
1: abort (with core dump, if enabled)
2: normal R exit

I felt it did have to do w/ the subject line since it seemed like bug- 
like behavior to me and one I thought might be simple to correct  
before 2.9 if that was the case. Sorry if that caused any confusion.

As it turns out, it was just a rather silly oversight on my part and  
indeed a boneheaded one at that because the behavior would have been  
clear if I took a quick peak at the implementation of the plot.default  
function.

Thanks for taking the time to clear it up for me.

There is some thing wrong on CRAN with Matrix recommended package for  
R 2.9.0 rc:

Note that Matrix is listed twice and the links is not created, that's

I'll assume that -24 is correct, create it manually and re-start the

the next nightly build?

I downloaded the Leopard 64 bit pkg: R-2.9-beta-48309.pkg

It installed without apparent error. I want to retain version 2.8.1 so  
I checked to make sure the receipt had been deleted.

Also installed the 64 bit GUI: R-GUI-5391-2.1-leopard-Leopard64.dmg  
with produced an icon named R.app

Renamed it R_2_9 and dragged to the Applications folder. Opening it  
caused an immediate crash with this error report:

R will run as a 64 bit process from a Terminal command line.

Now when I attempt to run 2.8.1 with the old 64 bit GUI app I get an

BTW the Matrix that was installed in the library was 0.999375-23-290

My current plan is to delete r 2.9.0(beta) and attempt to get 2.8.1  
running again.

The receipts are now superseded in Leopard by an internal database  
which is controlled by pkgutil, so you have to use pkgutil --forget  
instead.

That is the GUI for 2.10.0 (R-devel) so it wont work with your freshly  
installed 2.9.0. You should use the installed GUI in Applications that  
came with the R 2.9.0 beta.

I suspect this means that your R 2.8.x was upgraded to R 2.9.x so the  
R library is no longer present.

Yes, that was the version before RC. The RC now has -24.

Well, I would recommend you to install the beta first and try it  
(without replacing things etc.). You can always re-install R 2.8.1  
(the mini will do) to get back to your previous state (upgrades don't  
remove additionally installed packages).

Thanks,
Simon

The installer includes the instructions:

Note: By default the installer upgrades previous Leopard build of R
if present. If you want to keep the previous Leopard build, use
dpkgutil --forget.

1) I suspect that the command name should be 'pkgutil' (no 'd')
2) It would be very helpful to provide the name of the package that
would need to be forgotten.  I.E.  (guessing as I haven't actually
done the install yet)
    pkgutil --forget R-Framework.pkg

I forgot to mention that I also tried that strategem at a bash prompt  
after reading the MacOSX FAQ and was given the response the no such  
program could be found.

bash: pkutil: command not found

I am thinking I may not be properly qualified to be on R's bleeding  
edge.

Very few are, mate. :-)

I likewise got the ``command not found'' jazz when I tried pkgutil
from the command line (tcsh not bash).  Then I tried the ``locate''
command (which I've recently found out about) and

	locate pkgutil

turned up

/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.3/lib/ 
python2.3/pkgutil.py
/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.3/lib/ 
python2.3/pkgutil.pyc
/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.3/lib/ 
python2.3/pkgutil.pyo

So pkgutil is a python script.  I don't know what to *do* with that  
information, but!

Hoping that this may be a *little* help to you.

	cheers,

		Rolf Turner

That looks like a copy/paste error, but the question is, when?  Did you 
try to run pkgutil and miscopy the error message, or did the error 
happen earlier?

WTF?

  I (thrice)  1) tried the command earlier and got that message, and  
2) more recently correctly copied the error message when I ran it,  
and  3) now tried  pkgutil --forget R-Framework.pkg. Warnes said it  
was dpkgutil (or pkgutil), you say it is pkgutil. All three have  
unfavorable results. Screen-scrapes of the last two attached:

It is pkgutil as in my e-mail [thanks @ Gregg - I didn't notice the  
typo in the ReadMe]. The name to forget is definitely not R- 
Framework.pkg because it is supposed to be ID of the package, but it  
depends how you installed the first R. If you used the Leopard  
installer then it's

pkgutil --forget org.r-project.R.Leopard.fw.pkg

To see a list of installed packages, use

pkgutil --pkgs

Usually you only have to forget the framework, the GUIs install in the  
same location, so you have to move them aside in either case.

Cheers,
Simon

Are you sure you're talking about Leopard here? I think it is  
installed in the base OS X 10.5 at
/usr/sbin/pkgutil

This tool was not present in Tiger or older.

Among other things, I see these after:

.
.
org.r-project.R.Leopard.fw.pkg
org.r-project.R.Leopard.GUI.pkg
org.r-project.R.Leopard.GUI64.pkg
org.r-project.R.Leopard.gfortran42.pkg

So if I want to install 2.9 alongside with the GUI for 2.9 what should  
I do? My guess based on the foregoing would be use pgkutil --forget  
twice: once for the R pkg and onece for the GUI sot that I can keep  
both 2.8 and 2.9. I am assuming that the GUI's can get separate names  
and would be installed in /Applications/

Just a nitpicking comment:   if there's a database, you can access it 
with or without a special tool.  You just have to find out where the 
database is located ^_^ .


BTW,  Pacifist will let you do pkgutil actions from within its GUI.

And be careful:  there's a "Pkgutil 1.2" which is for Solaris. Similarly 
unless you've studied the code carefully I' guess the Python script 
referred to recently is not intended for OSX package control.

Message-ID: <p06240838c606c3c0b1cb@[10.0.1.200]>

Dear Simon and other R.Mac gurus.

I have been testing R version 2.9.0 RC (2009-04-10 r48318)
i386-apple-darwin8.11.1

locale:
en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/C/C/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8

and
R version 2.10.0 Under development (unstable) (2009-04-10 r48318)
i386-apple-darwin8.11.1

using the R.app that comes with each installation.

They both work very well,  and can even use 
Rgraphviz if that is installed from source, but 
there are two very small issues

1) The about R window  in both versions says
R 2.8.1 GUI 1.27 Tiger build 32-bit (5391) and
R.app GUI 1.27 (5391 Tiger build 32-bit), 
S.Urbanek & S.M.Iacus, ? R Foundation for 
Statistical Computing, 2008

Do you want to make that say 2.9.0 ?

2) The install local source package in the R 
package installer continues to have that weird 
typo  (Install,A umlaut Parenthesis mark) that 
has been around for a while (and justifiably 
ignored, for it is a trivial problem).

Thanks for the wonderful interface.  I was 
teaching a short course on R for psychologists 
last week and felt sorry for those who were using 
the PC interface.

Best wishes,

Bill

Thanks, I usually change the name to include the R version for the  
release. The devel versions usually don't have an R version number  
(because it' hard-coded), but apparently I didn't remove it. The  
release will definitely have 2.9.0.

This is some encoding issue on the build machine. When I build it  
manually, it's ok, so Im still not sure how to fix it .. (except to  
build the GUIs manually). I'll have a look...

Hi Simon -

The GUI's Change Working Directory is not working for me.  I navigate  
to the directory, click Open, and nothing happens.  Get Working  
Directory is fine.  I can make the change from the command line  
without problem.

Message-ID: <BB5FEAA0-7A3D-4BC4-B165-ADD418B9388F@berkeley.edu>


I ran into the same problem today (at least the symptoms matched) and  
it took me some time to figure this out... Basically I solved this by  
copying the file Sweave.sty to the same directory as the the .rnw  
file. I suppose you can also try to add the path to Sweave.sty. But  
then, by having the file in the same directory, when you send your  
stuff to other people, it is more likely that you will include it and  
prevent your collaborators from having the same problem.


A related issue is that the "missing Sweave.sty" error isn't shown in  
the TextMate output when you run "Sweave, Typeset, & View" even though  
it looks like it should.
     run_tex "$FILE" 2>&1| latexErrWarnHtml.py -v

I haven't really looked into this though. For now I just comment out  
the redirecting part
    run_tex "$FILE" # 2>&1| latexErrWarnHtml.py -v
so that I can see the LaTeX errors.


Hope this helps,
Saiwing

Yes, that's one problem (I solved it by copying the Sweave.sty into my  
texmf-local directory). Unfortunately, it does not solve my real  
problem, because the Sweave does work (--> the .tex-file is produced).

I agree - the problem should lie in the following portion of code in  
the Sweave.tmbundle:

run_tex () {
if [ "$TEX" != latexmk.pl ]
	then "$TEX" ${TM_LATEX_OPTIONS:=-interaction=nonstopmode -file-line- 
error-style} "$1"
	else "$TEX" -f -r "${TM_BUNDLE_SUPPORT}/latexmkrc" "$1"
fi
}

# Compile.
run_tex "$FILE" 2>&1| latexErrWarnHtml.py -v


Unfortunately my skills are to limited to track the error ... maybe  
someone else has an idea?

Best regards,
Felix

How long is the "hang"? Note that the installation can take a while  
depending on your connection since some of the packages are big. If R  
hangs for a while even installing one package, then there may be some  
problem with your internet connection. In that case you may want to  
download the files manually (e.g. thorough a proxy) and install them  
from local files.

Cheers,
Simon

No, that is (sort of) normal. The installation is synchronous, i.e. R  
won't come back until the installation has finished, so the R GUI  
won't be able to respond to the OS until R handles the control back.  
The OS interprets this as not responding, since the GUI cannot process  
event while R is installing away happily.

Well, why don't you tell us what is your problem with genefilter?  
(Actually you may even take this to the BioC list since this appears  
to be really a BioC question ...).

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Scoping question
Message-ID: <19906-24402@sneakemail.com>

Hi,

I'm struggling with a bit of scoping using the with() function. I think it's best explained with an example:
  x <- list(foobar=2)
  f <- function(){foobar*2}
  with(x,f())
This throws an error that 'foobar' does not exist. However if I define foobar in the global environment, f will find it whether I call it from the global environment or from within x. I have also tried using get("foobar",parent.frame()) within f, along with other variations, with no success.

I could always just add foobar as an argument to f, but in my actual work case foobar is a potentially very large object that is not worth making a copy of. (I don't know how much of an effect this will actually have on performance). I also just don't like all the bookkeeping of having to know which objects in x I am going to need in f and passing them all as arguments.

I would appreciate any insight about why the scoping is not working as I thought it would, and if there is any way to get around it without directly passing arguments to f.

Thank you,
Peter

Peter,

this is a list for Mac-related issues. Please use R-help for general  
questions for help - or actually just read about the difference  
between lexical and dynamic scoping (R uses the former which means  
that f will be evaluated in the global environment so there will be no  
foobar).

Cheers,
Simon

I think RcppTemplate is long deprecated and was replaced entirely by  
Rcpp if I remember correctly. The latter was updated no so long ago to  
work with OS X.

That is wrong! The configure is supposed to be run from the R  
environment which is where those variables come from. If you want to  
run it by hand, use the proper
R CMD ./configure
instead.

I suspect you have some old version - this problem does not exist in  
the current version...

Not really, the build process is correct. If you compile Rcpp from  
sources you'll have the correct path for your target destination.  
Apparently you didn't do that.

When you install Rcpp from a binary distribution, it cannot know where  
you are installing (binary installation simply unpacks the tar ball)  
it so it has no way of knowing the correct path. However, even if you  
use the pre-compiled binary, you can use the static version of the  
library which doesn't have path issues. Second, you can fix the path  
in the installed dylib binary - let's say you installed Rcpp in $HOME/ 
Library/R/2.8/library/Rcpp then you can run
install_name_tool -id $HOME/Library/R/2.8/library/Rcpp/lib/i386/ 
libRcpp.dylib $HOME/Library/R/2.8/library/Rcpp/lib/i386/libRcpp.dylib
(replace i386 by x86_64 for 64-bit or ppc for PowerPC).

You may have asked and saved yourself a lot of time ;).

I played with it a little more and I think I have gotten it to work  
properly for me. I still don't entirely understand why this works (!)  
so follow at your own risk :) First a bit of clarification, I set my  
TextMate up with TM_LATEX_COMPILER set to latexmk.pl (in TextMate  
Preferences). Then these 2 changes are made.

1)
need new version of latexmk.pl in . The original version is 3.07a, I  
got the one from
     http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/support/latexmk/
which is 4.05. It should be at
     ~/Library/Application Support/TextMate/Pristine Copy/Bundles/ 
SWeave.tmbundle/Support/bin/latexmk.pl
which might be different if you installed it using other methods.


2)
In "Sweave, Typeset & View", change a line in run_tex()
from
     else "$TEX" -f -r "${TM_BUNDLE_SUPPORT}/latexmkrc" "$1"
to
     else "$TEX" -f -pdf "$1"

* I am not sure why I need to call -pdf to get it to produce the pdf  
while wasn't needed in the original version.
* I don't have latexmkrc in my support directory and this option was  
making latexmk.pl unhappy.


Note:
* you still need Sweave.sty somewhere
* I commented out the standard error pipe in my last post. But with  
these changes I can (and should) revert the change.

Hope this helps. It would be great if someone can fix this properly  
instead of using some voodoo hack.

Hi,

A long time ago I noticed below 'SystemFlippers' message started  to  
show up, initially in R-2.8.0-alpha 64-bit.

It only happens in 64-bit and if you start R.app through osascript/ 
AppleScript, e.g. in TextMate using 'source file to R'.

Has anyone else come across this behavior?

Thanks,
Rob

Message-ID: <62D95869-8309-4333-8AF6-604E75B5F8A2@me.com>

Hi,

A long time ago I noticed below 'SystemFlippers' message started  to  
show up, initially in R-2.8.0-alpha 64-bit.

It only happens in 64-bit and if you start R.app through osascript/ 
AppleScript, e.g. in TextMate using 'source file to R'.

Has anyone else come across this behavior?

Thanks,
Rob

Yes (see the list archives), it seems a bug in Leopard when running 64- 
bit applications (it is not really R-related since many other  
applications seem to encounter it as well). AFAICS it is benign, just  
producing annoying messages.

You need to set the environment variable SWEAVE_STYLEPATH_DEFAULT to TRUE
In TextMate, that can be done in the preferences.

TextMate->Preferences->Advanced->Shell Variables

Add the variable "SWEAVE_STYLEPATH_DEFAULT" with value "TRUE"

I think that will solve the issue of of the style file not being found.

Dear Saiwing,

thanks for your efforts. I tried your changes, but they didn't work  
for me.
As Alan suggested, I posted the question once more on the Textmate  
mailing list; maybe I can get some help there ...

Cheers,
Felix

It looks like you don't have all the development tools installed.  The  
missing library /usr/local/lib/libgfortran.2.dylib is part of the  
Fortran compiler which is included with the full R installer.

This shows you what kind of R you are running (i.e. where was the R  
compiled), not what your OS is. You are running the Tiger release of  
R, which is ok since it is designed for Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) and  
later which includes your 10.5.

The "therefore" is wrong here ;).

The problem above doesn't come from affy, but from the preprocessCore  
package (see the error). The binary for preprocessCore you use is not  
quite correct. It uses local Fortran libraries on the machine that  
built it where it should be using the Fortran library inside R. If  
this is a binary from the BioC repository, please notify the  
maintainers, otherwise re-install the binary of preprocessCore from  
BioC. Note the the correct mailing list for such questions is BioC.

A work-around (that fixes the symptom, not the problem) is to install  
the full R (you seem to have only the mini version installed) which  
includes a local Fortran compiler - or you can install the Fortran  
manually from
http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools/

Cheers,
Simon

And downloading the tarball and installing is a recipe for failure. If 
you want to install source packages, just use the correct arguments.

biocLite("affy", type = "source")

will get you the correct affy version plus all required dependencies.

Best,

Jim

Why? People that don't have direct internet connection do that on a  
regular basis. You only have to make sure you don't unpack the content  
involuntarily.

I don't think Massimo was talking about source packages. That would  
require much more - you'll need Xcode tools etc. and you wouldn't see  
the error he was having since you'd be compiling it yourself. Note  
that on Mac binary packages are also tar balls and R knows what to do  
with them ...

Cheers,
Simon

PS: Normally you don't need development tools for binary packages - as  
I was pointing out there is something wrong with the binary Massimo  
was using.

The recipe for failure is directed towards BioC packages, which tend to 
have complicated dependencies. A significant proportion of the questions 
on the BioC listserv are due to people downloading things directly and 
installing and then wondering why they don't work (because they have the 
wrong version, are missing dependencies, etc).

The affy package is a perfect example. It relies on affyio and 
preprocessCore, so if any one package is out of sync you can get weird 
errors that would have been avoided by using biocLite().

Good call. I somehow translated .tgz to .tar.gz when I read the original 
post. My bad.

Massimo,
I'll break down these issues in two and go through them in turn:

1) stale binaries for R 2.8 at bioconductor.org
You had found that the Mac OS X binary packages at bioconductor.org that 
used fortran, like preprocessCore, had a bad gfortran link in them. I 
updated those packages last week and they are now properly redirected to 
the gfortran library that is provided with the pre-built version of R 
2.8. To fix this issue, please download the troublesome libraries again 
for a fix.

2) Determining which binary packages are appropriate for your Mac
I think you were downloading the Mac OS X 10.4 binary packages from 
bioconductor.org rather than the Mac OS X 10.5 binary packages because 
your pkgType == "mac.binary" instead of "mac.binary.leopard". You and 
either perform a global setting of the pkgType to "mac.binary.leopard" 
using options("pkgType" = "mac.binary.leopard") or specify type = 
"mac.binary.leopard" when using the biocLite / install.packages functions.

I have also modified the underpinnings of biocLite to produce a warning 
message when you specify type = "mac.binary" when you are running on Mac 
OS X 10.5 machine with some suggestions on what you can do to avoid this 
type of problem in the future.


Cheers,
Patrick

Do NOT do that manually! You can only use Tiger binaries in Tiger  
build of R even if you are running Leopard system, so the default  
setting is there for a reason (at least in CRAN binaries). The OS  
version is entirely irrelevant in this matter.

That will be very bad for the reason above ... Are you sure you mean  
that? Or am I missing something - are you talking about the running OS  
or the R build OS?

Simon,
I just tested the scenario of using standard R-2.x.x.dmg from CRAN is 
installed on a Mac OS X 10.5 machine and download the standard set of 
BioC packages and it worked as you predicted using the default type = 
"mac.binary". My bad. The OS version was a red herring.

Message-ID: <FA8CB106-7D78-4712-A160-738289F5C003@ipb.ac.id>

Dear colleagues;

I have R 2.8.0 installed in my Macbook Air and this morning upgraded  
to R 2.9.0.

In 2.8.0 I used to drag txt files to R icon while R is running; it  
will be openned in a new editor window. However now using 2.9.0 I  
failed twice dragging the txt file to R icon.

Hope for your help.

The attached logs show a hang, not a crash. At the time the GUI was  
busy running through syntax highlighting - could it be that you are  
using some very large files? Large files can use substantial time in  
syntax highlighting before they can be displayed. Are you using the  
exact same file you have loaded in 2.8.x? The highlighting code did  
not change in R 2.9.0 so a change from previous versions would be  
surprising. For very large files you may want to disable syntax  
highlighting [but at least on the machines I have tested this applies  
only to files of several megabytes which is not realistic for R  
scripts].

Cheers,
Simon

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] R 2.9.0 installer path for latex
Message-ID: <447207aa0904221043l1165745dqabf872cdd3578916@mail.gmail.com>

The current installer of R-2.9.0 provides the defaults for all of the
latex related programs with the path "/usr/texbin/<name>" for 3 of the
4 architectures:

 grep texbin /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/etc/*/Renviron
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/etc/i386/Renviron:R_LATEXCMD=${R_LATEXCMD-${LATEX-'/usr/texbin/latex'}}
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/etc/i386/Renviron:R_PDFLATEXCMD=${R_PDFLATEXCMD-${PDFLATEX-'/usr/texbin/pdflatex'}}
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/etc/i386/Renviron:R_DVIPSCMD=${R_DVIPSCMD-${DVIPS-'/usr/texbin/dvips'}}
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/etc/i386/Renviron:R_MAKEINDEXCMD=${R_MAKEINDEXCMD-${MAKEINDEX-'/usr/texbin/makeindex'}}
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/etc/ppc/Renviron:R_LATEXCMD=${R_LATEXCMD-${LATEX-'/usr/texbin/latex'}}
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/etc/ppc/Renviron:R_PDFLATEXCMD=${R_PDFLATEXCMD-${PDFLATEX-'/usr/texbin/pdflatex'}}
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/etc/ppc/Renviron:R_DVIPSCMD=${R_DVIPSCMD-${DVIPS-'/usr/texbin/dvips'}}
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/etc/ppc/Renviron:R_MAKEINDEXCMD=${R_MAKEINDEXCMD-${MAKEINDEX-'/usr/texbin/makeindex'}}
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/etc/x86_64/Renviron:R_LATEXCMD=${R_LATEXCMD-${LATEX-'/usr/texbin/latex'}}
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/etc/x86_64/Renviron:R_PDFLATEXCMD=${R_PDFLATEXCMD-${PDFLATEX-'/usr/texbin/pdflatex'}}
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/etc/x86_64/Renviron:R_DVIPSCMD=${R_DVIPSCMD-${DVIPS-'/usr/texbin/dvips'}}
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/etc/x86_64/Renviron:R_MAKEINDEXCMD=${R_MAKEINDEXCMD-${MAKEINDEX-'/usr/texbin/makeindex'}}

This will only work if latex is installed in that particular path, and
 is much less likely to succeed no path prefix, which at least works
as long as pdflatex is on the users path.

Message-ID: <C898C098-7D16-4F2F-9702-82E85972C84C@stonebow.otago.ac.nz>

I'm trying to compile R 2.9.0 from source on a MacBookPro (1.83 GHz  
Intel Core Duo, latest system software). I'm using the gfortran  
version from the R 2.9.0 GUI binary image and the following:

configure --disable-nls --with-aqua=no --enable-R-framework=no --with- 
x=no
make

This worked fine with R-2.8.1 but fails with the current version (see  
below). Using configure with defaults gives the same result. I have  
fink installed. Renaming /sw did not fix things either but resulted in  
a different failure (?). I don't know whether this is specific to my  
machine. I wondering whether there are any known conflicts with fink  
packages? Am I missing something obvious? Any pointers how to fix this  
would be much appreciated.

Hey,

I ahve a Mac book pro with Mac OS 10.5.6. Recently I installed Xtools, since then I cannot work with JGR. I reinstalled R (now 2.9.0) and rJava. The error message after a double click on JGR.app is 


Cannot find JRI library

Cannot find java/R interface (JRI) library (libjri.jnilib)
Please make sure you start JGR  by double -clicking teh JGR application


any help?

The above works for me (modulo the modules issue*) on a clean system,  
so I suspect your setup. In fact given the mismatches in the sources  
below I'd suggest you check that you really have the correct 2.9.0  
sources and not some mix of old and new sources.  More see inline below.

I cannot reproduce this, either, but it is really strange since  
S3Class defined in the headers. Are you sure you have the correct  
sources?

--without-ICU may help here (the line numbers don't match with the R  
2.9.0 source, though...). For some reason it seems as if R can detect  
non-Apple ICU on your system but it doesn't quite work. Apple's ICU  
comes without headers, so we work around that, but only if there is no  
other ICU. Please send me the config.log so I can try to find out why.


* - this was discussed on R-devel, probably the easiest work-around is
echo R: > ~/Makefile

Hey,

I ahve a Mac book pro with Mac OS 10.5.6. Recently I installed Xtools, since then I cannot work with JGR. I reinstalled R (now 2.9.0) and rJava. The error message after a double click on JGR.app is 


Cannot find JRI library

Cannot find java/R interface (JRI) library (libjri.jnilib)
Please make sure you start JGR  by double -clicking teh JGR application


any help?

You cannot load JGR from within an R session due to Os X 10.5  
limitation - you should use the launcher supplied on the JGR website.

If you upgraded R or used a custom package path before, you'll have to  
remove your JGR preferences
rm ~/.JGRprefsrc
and re-try. If that doesn't help, please run JGR from the command line  
(Terminal) as follows and post the output:
/Applications/JGR.app/Contents/MacOS/JGR

Thanks,
Simon

Gregg,

by default latex won't be on the PATH on OS X, so using no path won't  
work. The CRAN binary uses MacTeX which is the de-facto standard  
distribution on OS X now and that is what we suggest. If your setup  
varies, it's up to you to configure it properly, we can't do that for  
you.

Cheers,
Simon

Hi all,

Is it possible to tell whether someone is using the R GUI or the
command line programmatically?

Yes. If you're literally interested in the R.app GUI
Sys.getenv("R_GUI_APP_VERSION")
will be a real number (non-empty check should do).
If you want to know whether you're running in some GUI with Aqua  
support (the R GUI is one of them, but it could be others, too), you  
can use
.Platform$GUI=="AQUA"
This may, however, change in the future as we generalize AQUA-specific  
features into core R.

Cheers,
Simon

Great - thanks.  It's for a package where the user needs to be able to
abort a long-running computation (an animation) and we're trying to
give them correct cross-platform/gui instructions for doing so.

Then the first error in the original message occurs:
 
The error message after a double click on JGR.app is a popup-windows with following message:

 Cannot find JRI library

 Please make sure you start JGR  by double-clicking the JGR

You cannot load JGR from within an R session due to Os X 10.5 
limitation - you should use the launcher supplied on the JGR website.

Note: On Mac OS X we strongly recommend using iplots from within JGR.
Proceed at your own risk as iplots cannot resolve potential ev.loop  
deadlocks.
'Yes' is assumed for all dialogs as they cannot be shown without a  
deadlock,
also ievent.wait() is disabled.

Looks like the .Rhistory file is not being updated on quite.

Using R 2.8.1 GUI 1.27 Tiger build 32-bit (5301)

It was previously in an older version (don't know which release).

Did you change the setting? It is configurable, so whether it is  
updated or not (or where) depends on the your preferences and whether  
you saved the session or not (this has NOT changed recently).

If you think something is amiss, please be more specific, describe the  
exact steps to reproduce please use the latest version.

Thanks,
Simon

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] RMySQL
Message-ID: <82F6AA52-9FEC-4277-AD70-CBCFE05109D1@med.cornell.edu>

I recently updated to R 2.9 and I'm having trouble loading the RMySQL  
package into R64.

When I try to compile from source (from CRAN), I get an error message.
_____________________________
Configuration error:
   could not find the MySQL installation include and/or library
   directories.  Manually specify the location of the MySQL
   libraries and the header files and re-run R CMD INSTALL.

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Define and export the 2 shell variables PKG_CPPFLAGS and
    PKG_LIBS to include the directory for header files (*.h)
    and libraries, for example (using Bourne shell syntax):

       export PKG_CPPFLAGS="-I<MySQL-include-dir>"
       export PKG_LIBS="-L<MySQL-lib-dir> -lmysqlclient"

    Re-run the R INSTALL command:

       R CMD INSTALL RMySQL_<version>.tar.gz

2. Alternatively, you may pass the configure arguments
       --with-mysql-dir=<base-dir> (distribution directory)
    or
       --with-mysql-inc=<base-inc> (where MySQL header files reside)
       --with-mysql-lib=<base-lib> (where MySQL libraries reside)
    in the call to R INSTALL --configure-args='...'

    R CMD INSTALL --configure-args='--with-mysql-dir=DIR'  
RMySQL_<version>.tar.gz
_______________________________

I was able to get RMySQL working with the 64-bit version of R2.8 but  
only after a unix savvy friend helped me tinker in the root directory.  
Is there a more convenient way to get this working: I am Unix-naive.

Joe
