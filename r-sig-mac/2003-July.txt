Message-ID: <72BE574D-AC19-11D7-9644-003065CC4CB8@mclink.it>

I have added several minor features to the RAqua

http://www.economia.unimi.it/R/

as usual it is R-devel 1.8.0.

I'll soon attack the problem with package installation but before this 
I need to finish part of the GUI.

About package installation: we would like to provide, in the near 
future, precompiled binaries for RAqua at each release of R.

I'm thinking about selfinstalling stuff using apple pkg structures and 
apple installer.
The idea is:
1. I build R packages on a server and make .pkg bundles
2. the user select a package name from a menu (like on R for Windows) 
either on CRAN or on his/her disk
3. RAqua simply "opens" (double click action) on this file
4. the installer starts, an admin pwd is required.

Are there any other ideas/solutions before I start along this route?

(This can be done for Darwin/X11 R as well, but this is not a priority.)

Another thing: I need someone able to design a new icon for the RAqua 
launcher. Actually both StartR and RAqua (the true R) has the same icon 
and you can see two icons of R on the dock when R is running. I would 
like to change the StartR icon. Any volunteer?

I discover the problem with RAqua and package installation from source.

I'll upload a new version of RAqua soon, but if you have already 
downloaded toady's version you just need to edit the first line of the 
file

/Applications/StartR.app/RAqua.app/Contents/MacOS/R

emacs /Applications/StartR.app/RAqua.app/Contents/MacOS/R

change the first line from

#!/MacOS/sh

to

#!/bin/sh

exit emacs with ctrl-x ctr-s   ctrl-x ctrl-c

you don't need to rerun RAqua.

Form the R console use

install.packages("package_name")

The recent patch to the Apple 2002 tools, which includes the gcc 3.3  
compiler
also installs a new assembler. Although the default gcc can be  
switched, the assembler
cannot.

g77 3.1 or 3.3 from fink appear not to be compatible with this new  
assembler.

What about a "plugin" style a la Safari Plugins, Konfabulator, etc? 
Instead of having a .pkg why not just have the libraries live in a file 
bundle (.Rpkg perhaps, you can register the extension with 
LaunchServices to get nice icons and maybe open the HTML documentation 
when it double clicks or something...) and have those live in 
~/Library/R for user installed packages (this is important for multi 
user systems or if you're using a system where you're not root, like at 
a school using a lab) and system-wide non-base packages live in 
/Library/R and base (maybe recommended) living inside the R.app bundle.

Just a thought.

Message-ID: <40730350-ACAC-11D7-AF88-000393BB6D36@stat.ucla.edu>

RAqua is really beginning to look good. There are some things
I don't like, though. Better have them out in the open. Some of
them are probably in line to be fixed anyway. I am adding a
little wish list.

Having input and output in different windows, or in different
sections of one window, is bad, because it breaks the
perceptual link between input and output. After a while, the user does
not know anymore which input produced which output, and
so on.

Having buffered output makes this even worse. If my
program takes one hour and does 100 iterations, I want
it to write something to the terminal. Otherwise I dont even
know if it's running, and the link between my actions and
what I see gets even more lost. It's like submitting a
batch job to your local mainframe.

Having a monolithic application is ultimately is mistake,
I think, although it may be a useful option. A large framework
with all of R, except for a small GUI application which can
be anywhere (not necessarily in /Applications, which I
treat like /usr, so  it only contains Apple provided stuff).
Other GUI's share the framework, including Terminal
and future GUI's written in RCocoa (I wish).

The default working directory seems to be set to /,
which is obviously a bad idea.

The search stuff in R.help does not work (no doubt
an applet problem).

We need: a source code editor, either external and
linked to RAqua, or included. We need: R services
(Evaluate Command, Evaluate Expression, Search in
Manual from any Cocoa application).

The menu items send R commands to the Console. I
think it would be OK to have them send commands to
a history window (perhaps marked as having
been send from a menu), but having them in the console
sort of makes using Menu commands look rather stupid
(it says: if you had known what you were doing, you would have
used the console in the first place).

It is known that there is a hidden API to access the Window
Manager from command-line applications. If we knew what
the commands were, we could use Terminal.app and we
could uses pipes, so I hope Apple will release this at some
point.

Actually, it would appear that g77 3.1 is busted in general with the  
update. I've got a non-fink g77 (the same one that Stefano recommends  
on the RAqua beta test page IIRC) and its busted too...

If Jan is reading this thread, maybe he can suggest something?

It was talking with Simon (Urbanek) that convinced  me to implement the 
console this way, but it can be changed in principle letting the user 
specify what he likes more.
BTW, I think the user always know what he has done because I copy input 
to the output before processing. If you look at the R Console Out, you 
should noticed that. I had in mind this and I think it is a good 
compromise. For example pipes based front end don't do this if I 
remember well.
But my goal is to let people choose what they prefer :)

I absolutely agree. I have to solve this, but this is somewhat related 
to the eventloop. I'll try to fix on my own, but as soon as the 
REventLoop scheme is implemented in R it should disappear.

In case you have any hints to give this is what I actually do: I simply 
run and quit the eventloop each time 
(RunApplicationEventLoop/QuitAppEventLoop). This gives me very 
simplified code and let me to use all the standard handlers by apple. 
This also will allow me a rapid migration to Cocoa as soon as I 
understand how to mix objective C inside R.

I agree on this point too but it will imply very hard work and it 
should be taken under big consideration.

But, let me say, I think that the high priority has to be given to 
RAqua at the moment, the target being R-1.8.0.
My reasoning is the usual one: many people used Carbon R and don't want 
to deal with term/x11 or whatever.
They simply want a double-clicking app that they find where they expect 
it to be, i.e. inside /Applications.

The choice of putting all inside /Applications is due to the fact that 
I want to leave the system untouched as much as possible with the idea 
that, for example, my Darwin/X11 R can live in /usr/bin without 
interfere.
But of course I can leave StartR inside App and move the rest outside.

yes, this is a configuration bug I'm going to fix.

not sure, but I'll check thanks.

An internal editor I can implement is just a text editor like the old 
in Carbon R.
But I'll also reimplement the AppleEvent facility. This let RAqua being 
AppleScriptable and allows also for interprocess communication as it 
was with Alpha and Carbon R

Good idea the services.

or it can be: you wanted to to this, well here is the corresponding R 
Command.
But I agree it is lazyness.

I would be pleased to have these ...argh
have you seen the recent sample code by apple on running carbon code 
from X11 apps?
They open some carbon dialogs from x11 app. But there is still the 
problem of event loop, you cannot have both (X11/Carbon) event loop 
running...or at least it is what I have understand.

Thanks for all this remark, they have been very useful.

p.s. do not make distinction between RAqua and RCocoa. The RAqua is 
intended to be an Aqua GUI for R which is now implemented using Carbon 
API but can be rewritten (I hope shortly) using Cocoa.

Ah .. what I mean by RCocoa is an R interface to Foundation and AppKit
(like Pyobjc). Just a gleam in my eye.

If you want to build Darwin/X11 R with Apple's new gcc-3.3, then this is
possible. In fact, you can even set MACOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET
to 10.2 (and thus use weak libraries) and you will no longer
see the irritating warnings about /usr/local/include. Follow Stefano's
instructions at

http://www.economia.unimi.it/R/

but use Gaurav Khanna's g77-3.3 instead of 3.1

Make sure you have /usr/bin before /usr/local/bin in your path. Then do

sudo gcc_select 3.3
setenv FPICFLAGS -fno-common
setenv LDFLAGS -lcc_dynamic

configure --with-tcl-config=/usr/local/lib/tclConfig.sh  
--with-tk-config=/usr/local/lib/tkConfig.sh --enable-R-shlib  
--with-blas='-framework vecLib' --with-lapack

Then build and install. Although configure still indicates
some problems with the fortran compiler, this build passed all
checks. It is supposedly faster, but I have not tested this.

I also got the Aqua version to build though I ran into some trouble  
with the Debugging.h Carbon header. There's something in there that  
gcc-3.3 really didn't like. I commented out a series of innocuous  
looking #define's that caused the problem (for no apparent reason) and  
everything built fine, but I have no idea why those particular  
preprocessor instructions would cause problems.

I don't know if its just some weirdness with my Debugging.h, but the  
symptom is complaints about a bad left hand token during assignment  
IIRC.

I've had this problem too, and haven't been able to work out why.

The Debugging.h problem has been there for a while, also with 3.1. It's  
not you.

The Aqua version means R-devel and --with-aqua set ?

I was used to define inside src/unix/aqua.c (or devQuartz.c) the symbol  
DEBUG to 0.

But are you building 1.7.1 or R-devel?

p.s. I have implemented many new features in RAqua (R-devel) but I have  
not committed all of these changes yet. They will be out in a couple of  
days if I finish them in time.

R-devel as of a couple of days ago (I worked this out over the weekend)  
with aqua.

From buerkla at uwec.edu  Tue Jul  8 18:10:46 2003

Date: Wed Jul  9 00:10:40 2003
Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] R-1.7.1 with gcc-3.3 and --with-x
Message-ID: <06571935-B191-11D7-876D-00039394FB00@uwec.edu>


Building R-1.7.1 with gcc-3.3 (and g77 3.3) for X11 also fails, because  
the Carbon framework is being linked in the build process, even when  
the aqua device is not requested (--with-x --without-tcltk).

It fails because of a problem in Debugging.h, as mentioned in the other  
thread on building with aqua.

Why is devQuartz.c being compiled if the Aqua device is not requested  
(I see it is listed in src/unix/Makefile.in)?  Is this just a matter of  
the build process needing to evolve to accommodate both X11 and Aqua  
targets on Darwin?

Details are below.

Incidentally, the configure option --without-aqua does not function  
properly at present and instead is equivalent to --with-aqua.

Thanks for spotting these.
I'll fix it in R-devel soon.
A temporary patch will be to conditionalize inside devQuartz.c for  
HAVE_AQUA and skipping most of the code.
But this doesn't happen for  gcc 3.1

This should fix the problem:

#ifndef __QUARTZ_DEVICE__
#define __QUARTZ_DEVICE__


#ifdef HAVE_CONFIG_H
#include <config.h>
#endif
#include <Defn.h>
#include <Graphics.h>
#include <Rdevices.h>


#if defined(__APPLE_CC__) && defined(HAVE_AQUA)

modifying the first lines of src/unix/devQuartz.c

Can you please try?

Stefano's change to devQuartz.c gets the build process much further  
along, but it now fails on a conflict in the definition of _xerbla_  
between print.o and vecLib.  For some reason the compiler command for  
this line of the build has "-framework Carbon" in it.

That's just a warning, which is expected. It breaks because you do not  
have dlcompat
installed, so it cannot find dlopen and friends. If you do have it  
installed,
add -ldl to the link.

Moreover,
linking against Carbon framework should not cause any problem.

have a look at http://www.economia.unimi.it/R/

for dlcompat stuff.

Sorry for not seeing the error and instead mentioning the warning that  
occurs in the same place.

You are correct that it was a problem with dlcompat, but it is a bug in  
configure that causes it to not be found.  I have dlcompat installed  
from fink, so the files are in /sw/lib.  If I use LDFLAGS='-lcc_dynamic  
-L/sw/lib' the build works fine.

The bug in configure is that the test below doesn't pick up the LDFLAGS  
(line 2059).

if test -f "/sw/etc/fink.conf"; then
   : ${CPPFLAGS="-I/sw/include -I/usr/local/include"}
   : ${LDFLAGS="-L/sw/lib -L/usr/local/lib"}
else
   : ${CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include"}
   : ${LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib"}
fi

If it is changed to the following it works properly.

if test -f "/sw/etc/fink.conf"; then
   CPPFLAGS="${CPPFLAGS} -I/sw/include -I/usr/local/include"
   LDFLAGS="${LDFLAGS} -L/sw/lib -L/usr/local/lib"
else
   CPPFLAGS="${CPPFLAGS} -I/usr/local/include"
   LDFLAGS="${LDFLAGS} -L/usr/local/lib"
fi

To recap, the change described above in configure or something  
equivalent (if dlcompat is installed from fink) and the one line change  
in devQuartz.c are required to build R-1.7.1 with X11.

Thanks for the help.

-Alex

Hi folks, 

I'm a newcomer to this Darwin stuff, and I will admit for the last week I have regressed and switched over to using a PC's version of R 1.7.1. I am attempting to do a multinomial regression for a five leveled response variable using Harrel's Design library. As of yesterday I was able to finally get R Darwin to load the library (by retrograding to 1.7.0). 

However, I have tried data from 2 sources and cannot get either the read.table or read.csv commands to work (I've been getting a cannot open file 'Dir:crab.csv' error every time, even on files that I have opened with in Aqua with R 1.5.2) I am merely trying to transfer the files that I had build on the P.C. over to the Mac, so I can make any suggested changes to write.csv that you can recommend. Any advice will be greatly appreciated, hopefully this gets me onto R independence.

If I understand well you have problems with paths

BTW, I suggest you to use save() instead of write table to move files 
accross platforms (event if they both work).

suppose you have datas under R for Win, say "x". use 
save(x,file="x.rda")

move this x.rda file to you Darwin R  and use load("x.rda")

I assume that the file x.rda is in your current working directory.

Some notes:
* R 1.5.2 is a VERY old release of R, R 1.7.1 is out for Windows, 
Carbon R (which you call Aqua), Darwin R etc.
* You can use R-help list for kind of questions
* please be more specific on reporting problem, otherwise we cannot be 
helpful to you

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] help.start() and Safari etc

I have

 > options("browser")
$browser
[1] "/usr/bin/open"

and my default HTML browser in OS X is Safari (but it could be Omniweb 
or IE or whatever).

Problem: doing help.start() opens page
   file:///usr/local/lib/R/doc/html/index.html
AND it causes
   file:///usr/local/lib/R/doc/html/
to be the root for relative URLs from that page.  As a consequence the 
"Packages" link goes to the wrong page: it should go to the 
packages.html file in the per-session temporary directory, not the one 
in /usr/local/lib/R/doc/html/.

The problem seems to be that /usr/bin/open follows rather slavishly the 
links set up in the per-session directory: for example, when my R 
session makes temporary directory Rtmp536,
david% cd  /tmp/Rtmp536/.R/doc/html
david% ls -l
total 64
lrwxr-xr-x   1 david    wheel          31 Jul 16 08:45 R.css -> 
/usr/local/lib/R/doc/html/R.css
lrwxr-xr-x   1 david    wheel          36 Jul 16 08:45 about.html ->

lrwxr-xr-x   1 david    wheel          34 Jul 16 08:45 faq.html -> 
/usr/local/lib/R/doc/html/faq.html
lrwxr-xr-x   1 david    wheel          39 Jul 16 08:45 function.html ->

-rw-r--r--   1 david    wheel        6208 Jul 16 08:45 packages.html
etc

I can't see a way around this using /usr/bin/open.

What would be useful is a command-line executable, say 
/usr/local/bin/safari, such that
david% safari /tmp/Rtmp536/.R/doc/html/index.html
works in much the same way as does
david% lynx /tmp/Rtmp536/.R/doc/html/index.html
i.e., it displays the material at 
file:///usr/local/lib/R/doc/html/index.html but keeps as the root for 
relative URLs the temporary directory file:///tmp/Rtmp536/.R/doc/html

But I don't know how to make such a "safari" script or other 
executable.  Any suggestions?

The same problem seems to occur with other browsers such as IE and 
Omniweb.

David

This is not a browser problem, but a problem with "open"

 >cd
 >cat > aa.txt
aa
^D
 >ln -s aa.txt bb.txt
 >open bb.txt

opens the file aa.txt (in TextEdit). Of course as soon as aa.txt
is open it does not know anything about bb.txt anymore. Same
for

 > open -a /Applications/Safari.app bb.txt

So that's the problem. As for the solution, no idea. Obviously
if R would copy files to Rtmp instead of making soft links the
problem would go away. In fact hard links also work

 >cd /tmp
 > ln ~/aa.txt cc.txt
 >open -a /Applications/Safari.app cc.txt

does open /private/tmp/cc.txt

Well, here's a kind of answer to my own question.

Instead of making a link to /usr/local/lib/R/doc/html/index.html, 
help.start() can *copy* that file to the per-session temporary 
directory.  Then all works fine with /usr/bin/open as the browser 
option in R.

In case anyone is interested, my amended help.start function can be 
found at

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] moving from fink to self building

Dear listers -

I have been using R from fink over the past few builds, happily, but it 
seems that it pays to know the build process for yourself, given that 
the time until a new R build reaches stable in fink can be quite awhile.

So a few questions from a Unix neophyte.

With fink installed, and R installed via fink, all dependencies - i.e. 
dlcompat, readline and gcc - the list of required stuff on Stefano's 
page - are all in place, but perhaps the wrong place (sw?). Is that 
correct?

Question 1.
If one has the fink installation, does one need to install all of the 
pieces from the stefano website in /usr/local?

Question 2.
If the answer is yes, does it matter that you might have for example, 
dlcompat in two places?

Question 3.
Jan suggested the following answer to the most frequently asked 
question about getting R to start from the home directory: put the line 
: setenv PATH /usr/local/bin:{$PATH} into your ~/.tcshrc file.  Will 
this work even if you have the fink installation of R as well?  I seem 
to recall that fink sets up its paths for you....

cheers

If one has the fink installation, but does not want to use it anymore,  
mv /sw to /sw.tmp
while building R, and install what is needed in /usr/local

No, that does not matter. Dynamic builds know where their libraries sit.

If you want to continue using fink for other stuff, just insert this  
statement in ~/.tchsrc
after fink sources its startup script. But a warning is in order:  
populating /usr/local
eventually means conflicts with /sw -- which is the reason some of us  
have been
happy to get rid of imperialistic fink. The way to do it is if you are  
doing fink
things, then mask /usr/local by calling it /usr/local.tmp, if you are  
building Python,
or Emacs, or R from source, mask /sw. But of course you are bound to  
forget to do
this at some point,

I have attempted to build RAqua using the r-devel rsync sources. I'm 
still using Fink and the Dec 2002 Dev update.
It builds flawlessly until in the 
/Users/tom/Developer/R/src/modules/aqua directory.

I am using the following configure:

./configure --enable-R-shlib --with-aqua --without-x 
--with-blas='-framework vecLib'  --with-lapack
FPICFLAGS='-fno-common' LDFLAGS='-lcc_dynamic'

I consistently get warnings and errors trying to build aquaconsole.c. 
Most are warnings but the "BadParameter" variable
is persistent.

Am I missing a declaration somewhere by not including a header. I had a

Any thoughts.

It seems a problem with the macro "require_action" and gcc. The error 
at line 1509 is gcc parser error.
I have not this problem with Dec 2002 dev Tools. This is very strange 
as this is code coming from Apple's MoreFilesX

All the other warnings (not errors) will be fixed via castingthe 
parameters...but I'll do at alter stage when cleaning up the code.

BTW, when buiding for Aqua there is no reason to configure with

p.s. in today's r-devel version of RAqua I have implemented the edit() 
capabilities and I'll soon implement the data.entry facility.

The *.html based documentation is great, but the accompanying search
engine does not appear to work in either Safari or in Nescape 7.1 (it
hangs Netscape, and nothing happens in Safari).

I am wondering if anyone has found a solution to this problem.  I noticed
a recent discussion on problems with packages and wonder if it is related.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] tab key in R
Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.43L0.0307201057080.8001-100000@snow>


I am a new mac user and a new R user (but I have used S and Splus in unix
environments for a long time).  I have installed R and in general it seems
to be working fine.  Here is a problem that I am hoping someone can help
me with:

In an R session, hitting the TAB key twice produces a list of files in
the current directory. This is apparently some type of tab completion
behavior from my shell (but the behavior does not happen in the parent
shell).  Any idea on how to stop this?  It causes problems when reading in
code from others who use TABs to format.

Starting R with --no-readline will stop it (but will also disable
command-line editing).

Has onyone successfully been able to run the help file in R 1.7.1, either
through help.start() or from the file /usr/local/lib/R/doc/html/index.html,
from the latest version of Mozilla/Netscape? I can load the index, but not
search or access any of the help topics. I tried David Firth's modifed
help.start() from a few days ago, but no luck. Thank you for any advice
before I go back to an older version of the browser!

I had this same question a few days ago and 2 people told me to use an
older X11 browser, such as mozilla 1.2.1.  I have not tried this out yet.
