Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Binary builds for CRAN packages for R-devel on apple
 silicon
Message-ID: <CAC2h7ut+fze4GO=j5utOGXEZknrRjjikgyToY8qjoNpjjr0qaA@mail.gmail.com>

Thanks a lot for all the work being done to support R on macOS

A quick question. Are there any plans to build CRAN packages for R-devel on
macOS (like there is for windows)? Or is this being postponed until the
toolchain for R-4.5 has been chosen (which would be understandable.

I am asking because I have started to use binaries myself (as opposed to
building everything from source) and since Bioc devel is now using R-devel,
I have a need for binaries for 4.5.

Apologies if I am entering a minefield. Or if I just looked in the wrong
place for this.

Best,
Kasper

Kasper,

TL;DR working on it should be within a week or so.

The main constraint is the disk space on the package builds machines, I'll have to stop building packages for 4.3 to accommodate R-devel (yes, disk is cheap and all that, but you can't just plug in SSDs into a Mac so more involved...). Also as you noted, the plan is to update the toolchain which makes it more tricky to build on the same system. The pesky limit of 2 VMs per machine combined with the need to check as much as possible in parallel makes it all a little more complicated than you would think. That said, I'm working on it and it is the plan to make it available ASAP. FWIW the full build takes more than 24h so I may shut off the other builds for the bootstrap run.

Cheers,
Simon

Afaik there are no ABI changes this release, so the 4.4 binaries
should work on 4.5? Maybe a symlink contrib/4.5 -> contrib/4.4 would
work as a transition solution until the release.

Here is a simple proxy in R, install the webfakes package first, in
any version of R, then run:

webfakes::new_app()$get(
  webfakes::new_regexp(""), function(req, res) {
    url <- sprintf(
      "https://cloud.r-project.org/%s",
      gsub("4.5", "4.4", req$path)
    )
    res$redirect(url)
  }
)$listen(3000)

and then in another R-devel session you can install 4.4 binary packages:

install.packages("tiff", repos = "http://localhost:3000")
install.packages("cli", repos = "http://localhost:3000")

The sad news is that while tiff seems to work, cli crashes immediately
when loaded.
