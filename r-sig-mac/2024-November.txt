The R-admin manual section 6.6 talks about "mac.binary" to refer to
macos binary packages but I don't think this is working. On R-4.4.2:

  contrib.url(repos = 'https://cran.r-project.org', type = 'mac.binary')
  # "https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/contrib/4.4"

This URL is 404 because it is missing the /big-sur-arm64/ dir in the
path. For the same reason we get an error:

   install.packages('MASS', type = 'mac.binary')

I think in practice only type = "both" currently finds the correct
binary packages?

I think you can use .Platform$pkgType to get the string with the
appropriate suffix.

Thanks, Iris. I upgraded to 4.4.2 on my Monterey M1 Pro yesterday and had a
number of mysterious problems reinstalling packages. I wonder if this is
related to Jeroen's report?

That seems unlikely. The default installs usually work automatically and get binaries from the right place. Jeroon's issue is mostly if you want to force in a certain set of compiled packages from CRAN and/or that our documentation needs updating.  

However, I gather that there was a messup in Rcpp which broke it on 4.4.2, and I would not be surprised if fallout from that would affect the CRAN ecosystem via reverse dependencies for a while. (The actual issue got fixed quite fast, but things may take time to settle.)

Jeroen,

yes, you're right, that is incorrect. It should read "binary" as that is the only value that automatically picks the correct binary repository for the current R build regardless of platform. Or it should say "mac.binary.big-sur-x86_64" corresponds to bin/macosx/big-sur-x86_64/contrib and "mac.binary.big-sur-arm64" to bin/macosx/big-sur-arm64/contrib since the rule is "mac.binary[.XXX]" corresponds to bin/macosx[/XXX]/contrib and thus "mac.binary" is bin/macosx/contrib which has been used for the high-sierra build, but is not correct for the (current) big-sur builds. The user shouldn't really be manually specifying the build name, so that's why I'd not mention "mac.binary" and only point to "binary" as that is what users should be using.

Cheers,
Simon

Dear R-SIG-MAC

I have problems with R-4.4.2 in the latest Mac OS Sequoia (15.1) version in a Mac mini with an Intel chip. R-4.4.2 cannot execute my scripts. No such problems occur with R-4.4.2 in MacBook with ARM chip. 

I went back to R-4.2.3 and all is well in my environment (MacMini, Intel, MacOS X 15.1). 


I will try to provide an MWE to help those of you who know a lot about Mac OS X.

Best
Gilberto

Gilberto,

please read https://www.r-project.org/bugs.html first, in particular about how to report a problem. Just saying "cannot execute my scripts" is not helpful at all - please provide exact output, how it differs between the versions etc. For example, the problem may be in your code or packages used - we have no way of knowing without the necessary additional information.

Thanks,
Simon

Thank you. I found out later that this issue was also reported on the
bug tracker a while ago, so I think that can be closed now:
