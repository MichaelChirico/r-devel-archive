Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Apparent interaction between XQuartz and the Catalina
 (10.15) macOS upgrade
Message-ID: <36141903-5B13-4161-B59B-ADF408EA9F7C@me.com>

Hi All,

Perhaps I missed something relevant along the way someplace, but I ran the upgrade to Catalina (10.15) last night. I wanted to give folks a heads up on an issue that you may face, especially if you have XQuartz installed alongside R.

One of the sequelae of the upgrade is that some files may get relocated during the upgrade, likely in part due to the macOS SIP.

In my case, this involved the symlink for XQuartz, 'usr/X11R6', which gets placed into a "Relocated Items" folder on the Desktop. That folder, which is actually an alias to /Users/Shared, contains a folder tree with: Security/usr/X11R6. Naively, after seeing this, I elected to move the entire folder to the Trash.

That led me into a cycle of trying to figure out how to then delete that folder tree from the Trash, as I would get various OS errors in the course of doing so.

That led me to some Google searches, with incremental attempts at solutions, but eventually landing on the following thread in the Apple Community forums:

  https://discussions.apple.com/thread/250712783

After the first review of the thread there, and before user 'faikbey' posted a possible solution using Recovery Mode, I filed an Issue on the XQuartz github repo here:

  https://github.com/XQuartz/XQuartz/issues/1

It would seem that, at some level, one workaround would be to uninstall XQuartz fully before the Catalina upgrade, but there is no uninstall program provided by them. There is a series of CLI commands in a github gist here:

  https://gist.github.com/pwnsdx/d127873e24cef159d4d603accaf37ee4#file-gistfile1-txt

which appears to work, but would likely be best used prior to the Catalina upgrade, and then re-install XQuartz after the upgrade is complete.

The solution to the problem posted by 'faikbey' in the Apple forum appears to work in the original scenario, albeit, as I noted in my reply in that thread, I needed to first mount the user volume in Recovery Mode using Disk Utility, before I could proceed with the additional steps of deleting the files from the Trash, then rebooting into normal mode. 

If anyone else has experienced this and knows of an alternative/better solution, let us know.

Otherwise, let's see what the XQuartz folks might come up with on this, as this was not an issue with prior macOS upgrades.

Regards,

Marc Schwartz

I've been running Catalina since the first beta and upgraded to GM the day of release. Apart from having to stick R things into Full Disk Access I've had no issues with R nor XQuartz.

I read through the links provided and, while I do have said symlink in the relocated items folder Apple creates (this is new behavior for the GM), it gets re-created fine for me & XQuartz works fine (and the minor pkg deps I have installed that use it also work fine.

This would appear to be a YMMV situation.

Bob,

You ran the betas. On issues like this, that could be a big difference. So
Im not sure it is yet an issue that could be user dependent.

Kasper

I did not run any of the Catalina betas and have no problem with Catalina/XQuartz.

Bob,

If you have not tried to actually delete the relocated files folder, with the X11R6 symlink and then empty the trash, you have not experienced the issue in question.

In the past 24 hours, as a result of an increasing number of people upgrading to Catalina, the number of posts on the relocated files issue found via a Google search have increased by a magnitude.

Many of these are people simply expressing surprise at the new folder showing up on their desktops, but an increasing number are relevant to the specific issue that I raised, in not being able to delete these files from the trash and then having to go into Recovery mode to deal with it. 

That is not an acceptable solution for non-technical users, and the XQuartz folks need to address it specifically, but it is likely that Apple will need to address it more broadly.

Regards,

Marc

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Catalina and gfortran
Message-ID: <BE33A211-6BF7-4A13-94CD-08863696F4F1@neuwirth.priv.at>

I am trying to produce a n R environment on clean new Catalina installation (in a VM).
The R binary installer and RStudio work.
Then, I installed clang7, and that seems to work also.
gfortran, however, is a problem.
The 4.2.3 version (still in the tools folder on CRAN) is 32bit only,
so it does not work on Catalina.
6.1 from https://github.com/fxcoudert/gfortran-for-macOS/
cannot be installed, the installer tells that it is incompatible with this version of macOS.

Is there a workaround? Can I find a version of gfortran which will compile
packages containing Fortran code?
(I stumbled on classInt).

I also tried gcc at 7 from homebrew, but could not get it to run either.

Erich,

Try to install gfortran with this installer: 

https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools/gfortran-6.1.pkg

There is a package providing gfortran 6.1 on the page at
https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools/, and that should be used
now with the El Capitan builds of R.

FWIW, I've had success using gfortran from Homebrew gcc; you just need
to ensure that the correct Fortran libraries are passed along during
compilation. E.g. I have:

    FLIBS = -L`gfortran -print-file-name=libgfortran.dylib | xargs dirname`

in my `~/.R/Makevars`.

Best,
Kevin

gfortran 6.1 from the tools directory (which I simply did not notice) did install.
But it also seems to be 32bi and therefore does not work on Catalina.

 ????? Isn't there a 64 bit version of gfortran to use with Catalina?

Greetings and Salutations All,

From the tools page: 

"gfortran-6.1.pkg (OS X 10.11+, signed, 64-bit)"

https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools/ 

How is it 32-bit? The only 32-bit installer is the `gfortran-4.2.3.dmg`, which hasn't been used since R 3.4.z

Sincerely,

JJB

Hi,

I'm seeing the following when I attempt to install R-patched, as from
http://mac.r-project.org/:

---

?R-3.6-branch-el-capitan-signed.pkg? can?t be opened because Apple
cannot check it for malicious software.

This software needs to be updated. Contact the developer for more information.

---

I suspect this is pain being imposed by the requirement for notarized
applications / installers. The dialog can be overridden through the
Security & Privacy preferences pane, but Apple does not make this
obvious.

The official R 3.6.1 installer is not affected; likely because it was
grandfathered in due to its being published before Catalina was rolled
out.

Are there plans to notarize these builds of R? (can we be helpful in
making that happen?)

Best,
Kevin

Kevin,

thanks for the report. We are aware of the notarization and there are plans, but at this point it's unclear if it's even possible, given the various constraints and the way R works (it's unlikely that R as it is will pass the test). We definitely hope to have a solution for R 4.0.0, but it's unlikely that any R 3.x version can be released in a conform way.

Cheers,
Simon

Hi,

I am going to presume that Simon is already aware of this, but there is a page on the Apple Dev site that describes the workflow that can be implemented/customized to automate the notarization process via scripting:

  https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/notarizing_your_app_before_distribution/customizing_the_notarization_workflow

Whether this can be done efficiently to support the nightly builds via the current build system would be the question.

Also, with nightly builds, there is a risk of the notarization process introducing delays, as just happened:

The issue is not the process, the issue is that Apple requires particular way to build the binaries with particular tools in order to even be able to pass the notarization process and our current build does not use those. We can't change the tools in the middle of the release so for R 3.6.x we're stuck with what we are currently using which Apple doesn't accept. Hence the only hope is for R 4.0.0 and we're working on that.

Cheers,

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Saving a *.R file hangs R GUI under certain sequences
 of operations
Message-ID: <6721321C-A129-4557-BAB3-B1D4F1BE2AC6@depauw.edu>

I have found a sequence of actions that causes the R GUI on Mac to hang:

1. Launch R GUI.
2. Open an empty *.R file via the button or menu or shortcut.
3. Add something to the file.
4. Save the file via menu or shortcut (technically a Save as?).  In the save dialog box:
  a. If you save in whatever directory is pointing to, everything works fine.
  b. If you attempt to change the directory, for instance by clicking on the icon for a folder w/i the current directory, one gets the pinwheel of death and R must be forced to quit.

Can anyone else reproduce this?

Duncan?

I?m creating a new file. The menu item is ?New Document?.   I called it *.R to distinguish it from ?New Rd Document?, and since when you attempt to save it the suggested name is ?untitled.R?.

I don?t see anything in the console.  When I click an existing folder in the dialog, there is a brief delay and then the pinwheel, then it?s stuck.

I have Catalina and it works perfectly, as far as this goes.

Are you really entering an asterisk as part of the file name? That sounds like an extremely bad idea.

No, I was just intending to be generic in my description of the problem/process.  The filename defaults to ?untitled.R? and one can use that for testing (it fails for me).

Hello, All:


 ????? "update.packages()" fails for me on packages DescTools, digest, 
jpeg, mgcv, openxlsx, rlang, and spam.? It first says:


 ? There are binary versions available but the
 ? source versions are later:

rlang?????? 0.4.0?? 0.4.1????????????? TRUE
spam??????? 2.3-0 2.3-0.2????????????? TRUE


 ????? It then asks, "Do you want to install from sources the packages 
which need compilation? (Yes/no/cancel)".? I reply "y" or "Yes".? For 
each package, it says it was

Greetings and Salutations,

Note that Xcode Command Line Tools is not the same as Xcode IDE. In fact, only Xcode CLI Tools are required, which are light-weight compared to the IDE.

Regarding your error, this is symptomatic of an Xcode update tied to an OS point-release. Note in the session information 10.15.1 (the .1 being the bump)

    R version 3.6.1 (2019-07-05)
    Platform: x86_64-apple-darwin15.6.0 (64-bit)
    Running under: macOS Catalina 10.15.1

Both of the commands highlighted are accurate. Though, the order should be changed to:

sudo xcode-select --reset
sudo xcode-select --install

The reset changes back to using the default command line tools path. This was needed for Mojave.

Sincerely,

JJB

The

xcode-select ?install

is required after upgrading to Catalina.

I have several machines so I usually only need to figure out once what Apple has done this time :-)-O.

Once I know that, the other machines usually go without a hitch. And after a while one settles in and doesn?t even notice Apple being Nanny any longer. But I still write it into my handbook so next version I can remember :-)-O

I usually do homebrew first and when that works the other stuff usually compiles as well.

Or you can run

	make

if that works, xcode-cli is installed properly.

 ????? Thanks to James Joseph Balamuta and Eberhard W. Lisse.? I 
followed the 2-step procedure outlined by Balamuta, and it fixed the 
problem for all but the jpeg package.? I will write the maintainer of 
that package.? (The one-step would probably have worked, but I didn't 
try it.)


 ????? Thanks again,
 ????? Spencer Graves
