Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] error when installing the robustbase package
 (robustbase.rdb is corrupt)
Message-ID: <CADEmQoXNWDLHNOyXPUBawdHELbjD2gugfX5AmF3C_pdH5VJrPg@mail.gmail.com>

I'm running R 4.3.3 GUI 1.80 Big Sur Intel build (8340) and RStudio Version
2023.12.1+402 on macOS Sonoma Version 14.4 (23E214) Intel Core i7.

I downloaded the package of robustbase
- macosx/big-sur-x86_64/contrib/4.3/robustbase_0.99-2.tgz .
, and tried to install it.

After installing it through Tools/Install Packages,
it shows up in the Packages tab.

Clicking on the checkbox results in
```
> install.packages(?path/to/robustbase_0.99-2.tgz", repos = NULL, type =
.Platform$pkgType)
> library(robustbase)
Error: package or namespace load failed for ?robustbase? in get(Info[i, 1],
envir = env):
lazy-load database
'/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.3-x86_64/Resources/library/robustbase/R/robustbase.rdb'
is corrupt
In addition: Warning message:
In get(Info[i, 1], envir = env) : internal error -3 in R_decompress1
```

I've reported this to r-project tracker. They cannot help me because this
is not due to a problem of the source. Could you help me solving this
problem?

Thank you.

Y V

I would simplify things, and leave RStudio out of the process.  Start 
R.app, and run

   install.packages("robustbase")
   library(robustbase)

and let us know what happens.  I just ran those commands in MacOS 
Monterey and R 4.3.1, and saw this:

 > install.packages("robustbase")
trying URL 
'https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/macosx/big-sur-x86_64/contrib/4.3/robustbase_0.99-2.tgz'
Content type 'application/x-gzip' length 3221520 bytes (3.1 MB)
==================================================
downloaded 3.1 MB


The downloaded binary packages are in
	/var/folders/d6/s97fjjxd3_9353x_lwb692100000gn/T//RtmptD64D6/downloaded_packages
 > library(robustbase)
Warning message:
package ?robustbase? was built under R version 4.3.2

so it worked with just a warning because I'm using an old version of R.

Y V,

as Duncan pointed out this is usually a problem with the RStudio session. Quit RStudio, re-install the package (if in doubt, use R), quit R and re-start RStudio.

Cheers,
Simon

Issues of this sort typically occur if a package is updated or
reinstalled while it is already loaded. See also:
https://bugs.r-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=16644

The simplest resolution is to restart R after installing a package.

Best,
Kevin
