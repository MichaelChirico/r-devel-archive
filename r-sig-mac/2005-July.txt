Firstly, I don't think that is good idea.  If you want to build on  
Panther use gcc-3.3 and g77.  gcc-4.x is not really Panther  
compatible.  Why are you trying to do this?

Your compiler appears to be broken, which does not surprise me.

Message-ID: <m2d5pwuip5.fsf@macaroni.local>

Hi all,

I'm running a built from source R 2.2 (devel) on Tiger.  When I try to
install Rgraphviz, I get this when it tries to link the Rgraphviz.so:

gcc -bundle -flat_namespace -undefined suppress -L/sw/lib -L/usr/local/lib -o Rgraphviz.so Rgraphviz.o RgraphvizInit.o -L/usr/local/lib/graphviz -ldotneato -lm -lcc_dynamic -L/Users/Shared/builds/rpat/lib -lR
/usr/bin/ld: can't locate file for: -lcc_dynamic
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
make: *** [Rgraphviz.so] Error 1

I rebuilt the graphviz library after upgrading to Tiger and that went
fine.  

I saw Bill Northcott's recent post to R-devel in which he writes:

    The purpose of this is to add -lcc_dynamic to the link options
    when linking Fortran code built with an FSF g77 with C libraries
    built with Apple's gcc-3.xx compilers.  (see
    http://www.astro.gla.ac.uk/ users/norman/note/2004/restFP/ for the
    full story.).

Any idea how to avoid having cc_dynamic being added to the link list?

A command such as "open filename.wav" or "open filename.aiff" will 
open the file in iTunes.
"open spacemusic.au" will open the file in Quicktime Player.

If those don't do the job, then unfortunately, I don't know. It would 
be a good question for one of the Apple Discussion Groups.

On my 10.3.9 system there is:
    /Developer/Examples/Java/Sound/JavaSoundDemo
perhaps something could be made of that.

Where and how did you configure R? It seems as if you configured R in  
Panther or mixed gcc3 and gcc4 - neither is a good idea.

In Panther there is only gcc3 so cc_dynamic is always needed.  
However, if you upgrade such system to Tiger, cc_dynamic is removed  
by default so won't be able to compile packages anymore. You'll need  
to patch configured R files or re-configure/compile R for Tiger.

In Tiger there is gcc3 and gcc4:
- If you use g77 then you must use gcc3 and cc_dynamic is needed  
(what Bill was mentioning is that using CC=gcc-3.3 is not sufficient,  
you must also run gcc_select 3.3).
- If you use gcc4  and gfortran then cc_dynamic is not needed.

Since you seem to use both /sw and /usr/local there may be even some  
conflict of the compilers you use - you should check the compiler  
within R to make sure you have compatible versions.

For the CRAN binary we exploit the fact that cc_dynamic is static, so  
once linked into libR it's not needed anymore. Install script swaps  
Makevars and SHLIB for Tiger to remove -lcc_dynamic from the flags  
even though gcc3 is used. This allows us to compile packages with  
gcc3 even if gcc4 is selected.

Cheers,
Simon

Here's my configure line as found in config.log:
  --with-blas=-framework vecLib --with-lapack --with-aqua F77=gfortran

I built R after upgrading to Tiger and gcc --version reports:

  powerpc-apple-darwin8-gcc-4.0.0 (GCC) 4.0.0 20041026 (Apple Computer, Inc. build 4061)

Did I miss something in the configure line?  I can rebuild in a shell
without the fink stuff --- I'm only using that to be able to install
gnucash, but I think the problem is elsewhere.

> - If you use gcc4  and gfortran then cc_dynamic is not needed.

Well, I seem to be using gcc4 and if I build Rgraphviz by hand and
remove the -lcc_dynamic, I get a .so and can install the packge and
use it.  So cc_dynamic is not needed; how do I tell R that I don't
need it in the package building process?

How do I do that?

Hmmm, so do I need to do something similar?  (hoping not)

Message-ID: <423979b69fd7d67420a664c749025088@uga.edu>

I use mac os 10.3.9 and I've installed in my computer R 2.1.0 (I  
believe this is the latest R version).

Although it works alright when I open R by clicking in the R icon, I  
cannot use the graphics facility when I open R from a X-terminal window  
(or x-11 window).

In fact, when I try to open R I get the message that I pasted below.
Is this a R bug?
Is R assuming that I should have the latest Mac OS Tiger installed?
Or is it a problem related to my computer only?

I did not have this problem when I used a previous version of R (I  
don't know which one was).

Thank you in advance for your help.

Luis BA.

The best place for MacOS issues is the r-sig-mac list to which I have  
copied this mesage.

MacOS X does not have a registry!  Configuration files for MacOS  
applications live in ~/Library/Preferences.  The file for the R GUI  
app is called org.R-project.R.plist.  The rest of R on a Mac is just  
like any other UNIX platform with settings and history in ~/.Rdata  
and ~/.Rhistory.  (Files starting with a period '.' are invisible in  
the MacOS desktop.)  If you want to trash the configuration just  
delete these three files.

The version 1.12 you quote is only for the GUI, which is just a front  
end for the R framework.  The current version of the framework binary  
is 2.1.1, which you will see on the 'R Console' window when you start  
the application.  If you try the 1.12 GUI with a version of the  
framework other than 2.1.1 it is very likely to crash.  If you  
install the complete package from CRAN it will install both the GUI  
application and the framework.

Its not so much gcc4 as it is your particular installation that  
appears to be broken. Try using the versions from hpc.sf.net

Please copy your messages to the r-sig-mac list.

I am afraid that 'it did not work' provides no information useful for  
troubleshooting!

Please explain how it fails.  What did you try to do?  Have you tried  
invoking the command 'R' in a Terminal window?  If that works, then  
the problem is with the GUI, and if that is crashing there should be  
entries in the crash logs (see Apple's troubleshooting procedures)

This is the text from the 'R for Mac OS X FAQ' which is referenced

This is quite adequate for Panther, but is likely to lead people into  
problems with Tiger where gcc-4 is the default.

The current CRAN binary includes g77 from gcc-3.4.2.  This will not  
work on Tiger unless the user does a 'sudo gcc_select 3.3' to change  
the default compiler.  It would be good to document this.

> Please note that it is important that the version of the Fortran  
> compiler matches the version of your C compiler!
IMHO this is a tad confusing, given that the paragraph above says use  
g77 3.4.2 with gcc 3.3!  Do these match?  AFAIK it is only the major  
version numbers that need to match.  I think it would be much more  
helpful to be explicit and say use g77 3.x.x with Apple gcc 3.x.x  
and, only on Tiger, gfortran with gcc-4.x.x.  This is of course where  
I came in: the configure script should check this and provide an  
appropriate error message if there is a mismatch.

Finally the bit about removing dynamic libraries confuses me.  Martyn  
gave the same dire warnings about building JAGS, but they just don't  
seem to apply to my set ups.  I have all the dynamic libraries  
installed and the R I build from sources passes all the checks.  What  
is it that gives people problems?

/usr/local/lib and /sw/lib give people problems if they are not  
careful because
they will get their symbols in the wrong places.  gcc by default  
looks first in /usr/local.

you, of course, are careful.

Apple version 5213 from CVS is gcc-4.0.1 with a corresponding gfortran.
This is a massive update.

If you really want to use gcc-4 on Panther, you can, by updating the  
cctools package as described on hpc.sourceforge.net.  However, it is  
flying very fast and very very low because gcc-4 can easily produce  
object code which will not run on Panther.  It is most definitely  
unsupported!

Great news.  There is talk on the rumour sites of Xcode 2.2.  I  
wonder if it will include gfortran.

No, it doesnt.

By the way, a bootstrap gcc-4.0.1 from CVS builds R just fine (on Tiger,
obviously).

Message-ID: <20050711115729.GE5990@kunpuu.plessy.org>

Dear R-SIG-Mac at R-project.org,

If I save a graph as a pdf via the print menu of the osX GUI, it
sometimes adds a mirror image of the "save as..." dialog box.

(see http://charles.plessy.org/Rbug.png)

Trying to print the graph from a "fresh" window usually solves the
problem.

By the way, how can I thank you for making R.app available. Can I donate
a few euros ?

Best regards,

Why not donating to the R Foundation ?

thanks for your feedback Charles, but can you tell us OS X version, R

Does it copy the fortran libraries into the final build directory  
dst/ ?  gcc-5026 from Xcode 2.1 will build all the fortran components  
and install them in the staging directory obj/dst-powerpc-powerpc but  
I had to copy them manually to the final distribution tree.

Since we are at it, can anyone suggest how to remap the hash key (#)? I
have a powerbook with a UK keyboard. Normally hash (#) is <alt> 3 but
after using the following lisp to remap a few keys:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
;; remap backspace on keyboard to be sane
;;
(keyboard-translate ?\C-h ?\C-?)

;;; MacOS X specific stuff
(setq mac-command-key-is-meta nil)

;; Define the return key to avoid problems on MacOS X
(define-key function-key-map [return] [13])

(global-set-key [(alt a)] 'mark-whole-buffer)
(global-set-key [(alt v)] 'yank)
(global-set-key [(alt c)] 'kill-ring-save)
(global-set-key [(alt x)] 'kill-region)
(global-set-key [(alt s)] 'save-buffer)
(global-set-key [(alt l)] 'goto-line)
(global-set-key [(alt o)] 'find-file)
(global-set-key [(alt f)] 'isearch-forward)
(global-set-key [(alt g)] 'isearch-repeat-forward)
(global-set-key [(alt w)]
                 (lambda () (interactive) (kill-buffer (current- 
buffer))))
(global-set-key [(alt .)] 'keyboard-quit)

(global-set-key [(alt q)] 'save-buffers-kill-emacs)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


I cannot use <alt> 3 to produce the hash, so I cannot comment my code (a
good thing, some would say).

Cheers,

Federico

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] restFP and saveFP errors installing R and R libraries
Message-ID: <Prayer.1.0.14.0507141832430.12113@hermes-1.csi.cam.ac.uk>


Hello Mac R wizards,


We have been trying to install the following R libraries "rmutil" and 
"repeated" from Jim Lindsey's web page. 
http://popgen.unimaas.nl/~jlindsey/rcode.html These libraries are required 
for the aCGH package in BioConductor (http://www.bioconductor.org/) We got 
errors during their installation..... ld: dist.o has external relocation 
entries in non-writable section (_TEXT,_text) for symbols: restFP saveFP


>From the R-help mail list we got a reply suggesting that we might avoid the 
problem by installing R from source. We attempted to do this, but got 
similar errors relating to restFP and saveFP in the make step. Brian Ripley 
suggested that this has something to do with the fact that the Fortran 
compiler on mac is compiled using FSF rather than with on the apple system.

see http://www.astro.gla.ac.uk/users/norman/note/2004/restFP/

"The DarwinPorts and Fink g77 builds use the Free Software Foundation (FSF) 
GCC, while the Apple compilers use a GCC variant with OSX-specific 
modifications which have not, or not yet, been integrated with the FSF 
mainline. That means that the GCC back-ends -- that is, the parts which 
generate the object code which is linked to make libraries and executables 
-- produce object code which is slightly different, sometimes to the point 
of being incompatible. This incompatibility is a problem if and only if you 
are using both back-ends, that is, if you are mixing Fortran (from FSF g77) 
with code produced by Apple GCC."

So....we tried
% env LDFLAGS=-lcc_dynamic ./configure
and got the following error

$ env LDFLAGS=-lcc_dynamic ./configure --with-blas='-framework vecLib' 
--with-lapack --with-aqua checking build system type...

So then we went to
http://www.swarm.org/wiki/Swarm:_MacOS_X_binaries#Notes_on_packages
installed the following for Tiger

2004-02-04/gsed.pkg.sit
2004-02-04/libpng.pkg.sit
2005-02-05/tcl8.4.7.pkg.sit
2004-02-04/hdf5_1.6.1.pkg.sit
2005-02-05/swarmx2.2.pkg.sit

and
gcc-4-swarm.dmg

The idea for doing this was to get an apple compiled fortran compiler.

Then we re ran the ./configure using
./configure --with-blas='-framework vecLib' --with-lapack --with-aqua

with no apparent errors
but the make gave the following error output shown below

Another suggestion on this website 
(http://www.astro.gla.ac.uk/users/norman/note/2004/restFP/) is to do the 
following????

"The restFP and saveFP functions are defined in Apple's libgcc, and so the 
fix is simply to include this library in your link line. The best way of 
doing this is to include the option

-lcc_dynamic
in your link line."

But we don't really understand what this means?


Any help would be much appreciated.

Thanks,

John

It seems you navigate through lots of web pages but probably not read  
the R for Mac OS X Faq.
You are not even telling us R version, os x version and tools  
installed (i.e. gcc, g77 etc).
My suggestion is to read the R for OS X FAQ and consult both http:// 
wiki.urbanek.info/ and http://www.economia.unimi.it/R

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] g77 from R-2.1.1.dmg won't install
Message-ID: <6FF69D57-8318-484B-BF7F-A828247DE6C6@imperial.ac.uk>

Hi All,

I just downloaded R-2.1.1.dmg. R gui and framework installed without  
a problesm but I cannot install g77.

I already have a g77 in /usr/local/bin. What I am not sure about is  
whether this is the fortran compiler that comes with Xcode 2.1, and  
whether I need to install the g77 in the dmg considering that a g77  
is still present on my box. Incidentally, I am running OS 10.4.2.

Any advice will be apprecciated.

Cheers,

Federico

How could get that? the graphical installer does not seem to produce  
any log (or, I would not know how to get the logs from the graphical  
installer).

I installed Design and hmish from source... if memory serves me well  
and they actually contain some fortran I did not get any troubles.

try to reinstall g77 with the installer.
Before proceeding with installation (button "continue"), open the log  
window from the installer -> window menu.

I did. It fails all the times. Also tried different dmgs from different
mirrors. Still won't work.

I apologize, I missed your previous msg and write mine first :)

It seems a permission issue.

It could be (just a guess) that you did install g77 with more  
priviledges then the installer needs.

could you send us some infos on that?

meanwhile, my suggestion is to remove the offending old version of g77
sudo bash
rm /usr/local/bin/g77
cd /usr/local/lib/
rm -rf  gcc   <- before doing that PLEASE check that inside the  
hierarchy of this directory you only have g77

stefano
I think one good option is also to remove the .dylibs of the old g77  
compiler in /usr/local/lib as well.

There seems to be LOTS of stuff in /usr/local/lib/gcc in a dir tree  
that is both deep and uninformative (no name, either g77 or gcc). I  
bet i's mostly C stuff, mostly .h files. So, to be on the safe side  
I'll not remove (btw, where does Xcode dump it's compiler? in the / 
Developer branch?).

I cannot see any .dylibs connected to g77 there:

do I need to specify a target with

sudo installer -pkg g77.pkg

?

on all my Debian boxes all I find in /usr/local is the site-library
dirtree for the extra R packages I install NOT using apt. Never seen it
so cluttered as in my OS X box.

... which tells something about your box ;). On a OS X ideally /usr/ 
local should be empty, because the "native" way is to use frameworks  
(like R does) that live in /Library/Frameworks. This makes them more  
available and independent of nasty configuration flags. No Apple  
software uses /usr/local so whatever is there must have been  
installed manually and doesn't affect normal Mac applications.

However, there are still libraries that either are not available as  
frameworks or need to be used by code that was not ported to OS X  
yet. I try to keep those to a minimum, but sometimes you can't help.

Cheers,
Simon

Please, can you be more specific as of why you cannot install in and  
send us the installer log? That would be helpful.

No it's not. Everything in /usr/local is external software not  
supplied by Apple. Besides Xcode includes no Fortran compiler.

That depends. We are shipping g77 now with R to make sure the  
configuration of the binary matches the compilers used. Your own  
version of g77 may or may not match it - there are too many different  
version around by now to tell. Basically if you can compile Fortran  
packages from sources it should be fine.

Cheers,
Simon

Message-ID: <AE7C809B-26B9-4698-8B4A-16BF3A78B2AA@life.uiuc.edu>

I have the latest version of R.  I noticed an issue with setting  
console colors.  Basically, they don't stick.  If I change the  
settings during a session then most colors in the console are changed  
the way I want.  The exception being the input, which stays the  
default color until after hitting enter.  I close out the preferences  
and quit R, then re-start and find that the console colors are back  
to the default.  ???

I have attached the run log from Xcode. I started a session, set new  
preferences, quit, and restarted as described.

Another thing, I don't seem to be able to interrupt any commands.  I  
used to be able to hit <esc> -- but for some reason this is now  
mapped to auto-complete -- i.e. on my box <esc> and ctrl-.  and cmd-.  
all do the same thing.  The only way I can kill a process is to hit  
stop, but I can't, say, clear a line if I don't really want to  
execute the command I just typed.  I have to delete everything  
myself.  Used to be just hitting esc would clear the line ...

Cheers,

Steve

You needed to start again with a fresh source tree!  You are just  
reusing the libraries you compiled with the previous compiler, which  
is why the problem has not gone away.

-lcc_dynamic won't work with gcc-4.  It solves the problem if you are  
using gcc-3.3 with g77.  I have been asking Simon to change the  
documentation to make this more clear.  You must use either gcc-3.3  
with g77, or gcc-4 with gfortran as you will find in my compiler.

Federico is making a good point here.  The g77 package in the CRAN  
distribution does not seem to be set to require system  
authentification.  So if it is run directly, it will fail.  The  
overall metapackage does require authentification, so if the g77  
installer is run from that, it works.

I had the same problem.

You are doing better than me.  My attempt to install rgl from source  
ends thus:

scene.cpp: In member function 'void Texture::beginUse(RenderContext*)':

make: *** [scene.o] Error 1

which looks pretty terminal.

I fudged up the code in scene.cpp and got it to install. Now I have  
your problem.  I assume this is because the R binary has been built  
without libpng.  Mine certainly was.  I will try again with libpng.

Bill Northcott

PS Rebuilt R with libpng and now it all works.

on Tiger, with R 2.1.1 from CRAN, if you install rgl with  
install.packages("rgl",type="source"), the rgl package builds fine  
(apart for small ld warnings) but the result is as reported by  
Anestis. If you don't have libpng in the system this doesn't hurt  
compilation.
You can install libpng in your system but this doesn't fix the problem.

Apart for png graphics, it seems to me that the rgl device has  
problems with refreshing (under tiger).
Points and lines are drawn but afterwards removed by an incomplete  
refresh.
I don't know if this also happens on 10.3.

One more thing.
R 2.1.1 that comes from CRAN has libR statically linked against  
libpng, thus png support is there already (try png(); example(plot);  
dev.off())
But if you want to build rgl package you need to have libpng include  
files (at least).
So you only need to install libpng following the steps at http:// 
www.economia.unimi.it/R and remove all *png*.dylib entries from /usr/ 
local/lib.

Is it possible to either page through the output to the Quartz  
device? Or alternatively, if there are multiple pages, require  
keyboard input
prior to the next graph being displayed.

If I remember is possible to do this on the windows version of R.  
Unfortunately, I don't seem to be able to work this one out under OSX.

FWIW: the latter shouldn't be necessary since 2.1.1. Actually, can  
anyone confirm this? (= if you have libpng.dylib in /usr/local/lib it  
used to crash R 2.1.0 on Tiger due to ImageIO framework conflict, but  
that shouldn't be the case with 2.1.1 anymore).

How does the build work?  As far as I could see the code in scene.cpp: 
1993-1994 is clearly incompatible with Apple's OpenGL header file.   
Perhaps it is because you are using gcc-3.3 which does not recognise  
the error.

yes, I'm assuming gcc 3.3 as I'm talking about R 2.1.1 from CRAN.

Hi,

I have a local website where I host an R package which I build on Windows,
so I can easily create a source (.tar.gz) version and a Win32 binary
(.zip).  My package doesn't contain any compiled code (e.g. C, Fortran),
so installing from the source package should be fine for MacOS X users. 
In the past, I believe that MacOS X users could use install.packages()
successfully without any package 'type' specification, even though there
is no .tgz file, but now it seems that they need to explicitly say:

install.packages(..., type="source")

Right?

Is this a permanent change?  Are there any tricks like creating a .tgz
which is really the same as the .tar.gz (source) package, or creating a
symbolic link from .tgz to .tar.gz?

Or are these the only choices?
1. Build a Mac binary every time I update the version number in the PACKAGES
file.
  OR
2. Tell all users that they need to use type="source", now.
  OR
3. Submit my package to a repository where Win32 and Mac binaries are
built for me.

Regards,
James

you can create a .tgz archive from the installed version of the package.

option 3 is the preferred way, and this essentially mean CRAN.

I could not get onto the rgl website and I don't have an email  
address for the maintainer.

Also my kluge is definitely not a proposal for a fix.

If they use the GUI, Package Installer makes it easier for them ...

> Is this a permanent change?

FWIW: strictly speaking this is not a new change - the documentation  
was describing exactly this behavior for a while - it was merely a  
bug that the package installation implementation wasn't really  
following the documentation.

The main reason for this behavior is that unlike other unix systems  
OS X comes by default without development tools, so you simply cannot  
use type="source". Therefore the default is to use binary packages  
which is the recommended way.

I would recommend 3 if the package is of general interest or 1 if for  
some reason you don't want to publish is openly. I would discourage 2  
for the reasons mentioned above.

For now you can "fake" the .tgz file, but that is also discouraged as  
the binary may in fact be different (e.g. code in saved image etc.)  
and may change with future versions.

Cheers,
Simon

I am not sure this is a good decision.  MacOS X is always supplied  
with the Xcode development tools, which is not true of all the UNIXen  
I have dealt with.  It is really only Linux that I know to install  
developer tools as part of the default install and even then it is  
usually necessary to install header packages to actually build  
anything.  Finally I doubt that there are many R users on MacOS X who  
do not have the Developer Tools installed, after all, they need X11  
which is also an optional install.  Indeed you supply g77 as part of  
the CRAN binary, and that is useless if you don't have the Developer  
Tools.

if you have the dev tools put options(pkgtype="source") in your  
Rprofile.site

but I agree that it is generally a good idea to have R compiled with the
same compilers that build your packages

so that means that you should use source packages if, and only if,  
you build and
regularly update your own R

The notion that "I doubt there are many R users on MacOS X who do not  
have the Developer Tools installed" is a problem in classroom  
settings, where you can fairly easily explain to students who use a  
Mac that they need to load X11, but having them also load XCode  
tools, and then have them deal with the g77/gfortran issues would  
likely be beyond most of them.

Bill,
my personal experience (which dates 2001 on R for Mac) is that I  
receive dozen of user's feedback and they even don't know what a  
compiler is. They don't even know where to find the Dev Tools on the  
distribution. And that's the reason why we provide binaries.
More over, I know about people that know what a compiler is and they  
installed DevTools but when you talk about X11 they are lost: they  
install the X11 application and they think they also have header  
files installed which is untrue as apple made this an optional  
install on devtool cd. (I've got this kind of report two days ago!)
You are a quite advanced "user".

OK.  So I got duly beaten up for those last remarks which is probably  
justified.

I think Jan has it right.  As things stand, users should not use  
source packages unless they have built R on their system.

I have been chewing on these issues because I package up Swarm  
libraries for MacOS X, and I am trying to sort out my next generation  
for Tiger.

Then Stefano got me to the next step.  MacOS is philosophically not  
Linux or UNIX.  It is meant to be used by grandma.  The implication  
of this is that we should not ship MacOS X binary installers that put  
anything in /usr.  That is Linux/UNIX thinking.  Such stuff is only  
really usable by people who DO understand what a compiler is, and  
grandma definitely does not.  It is not unreasonable to ask users to  
install items like X11 or Xcode from the Apple supplied disks they  
already have.  We know exactly what those packages contain.  However,  
everything else that our software needs such Tcl/Tk X11, Fortran  
compilers etc. should be bundled in the binary frameworks we  
install.  That way our software cannot interfere with anything else  
on the users computer, and if R was packaged like this it might even  
be possible for the user to build source packages without needing to  
understand what is going on.

My apologies for chewing on this out loud, but the discussion has  
been helpful to my thoughts.  I now need to work out if I can see how  
to do this.

Cheers
Bill

Bill,

A couple points:

(1) I'd be happy to use package binaries only, but the problem is  
that not all packages that I might want to use are available as  
binaries;

(2) there exists a range of competencies in the Mac OS X world, just  
as there are in the UNIX & Linux worlds; it is not a matter of there  
being specialists with detailed knowledge of all the intricacies of R  
and building R, etc. (or whatever) and everyone else (Grandmas)

(3) many people, such as myself, operate in different computer worlds  
virtually simultaneously. On Mac OS X one of the major drawing points  
is that on a single machine I can do my Mac stuff and 'Linux/UNIX'  
stuff where certain interactions between software are desired and  
needed. I often process a lot of data files using R and GRASS GIS  
together, so I have written Perl/shell scripts to aid me. I would not  
be limited in ways that I could no longer do this.

Regards,
Tom

I see many people have been busy making the points I had in mind, so  
just two quick add-ons:

Those are exactly the reasons why tcl/tk library and g77 are disabled  
in the installer by default, although we include them in the CRAN  
image - if you know what you're doing, you can enable it, if you  
don't - nothing to worry about.

Ideally we should supply Tcl/Tk private framework for R, such that it  
is entirely self-contained, but we could get into trouble with Tcl/Tk  
add-ons in some R packages and configure scripts. This setup is a  
temporary work-around anyway, because in the long run the CRAN binary  
should use Aqua Tcl/Tk and not depend on X11 (while still supporting  
it, of course).

Thank you all for contributing to the discussion - the arguments I  
presented in the first mail were just what we came up after some  
thinking about it, but we could be wrong, so it's good to hear what  
the users really want...

Cheers,
Simon

Quite so, but bundling everything that is not part of Apple's MacOS X  
distribution into the binary framework makes building source packages  
easier not more difficult.

Again this is my point.  As many source packages as possible should  
build with the binary R distribution without the users needing to  
understand the process.

I don't see this.   Nothing I suggested would stop you writing  
scripts.  MacOS X Tiger comes complete with Perl, Python and Tcl/Tk,  
but the only things installed under /usr are minimal wrappers or  
symlinks that invoke code in Frameworks or other subdirectories of / 
System/Library.  Indeed the only thing that a binary install of R  
puts under /usr is a single  symlink into the framework.

By using the menu command, I am able to open the built in editor  
without tieing up the command line the way that edit() does.  Is  
there a way to do this from within R?  Also, is there a command to  
start the X11 server from within R or is this also only accessible  
from the menu?

Thanks,

Hi Robert,
I'm following this to r-sig-mac and r-devel.
Btw, you said "any"  but do you have any chuck of R code to test as  
well?
example(acf) works for me.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] emacs to edit .R files: hash (#)
Message-ID: <F426EAF9-DD8A-4B84-9BD9-DAE79501038C@imperial.ac.uk>

Hi All,

I suspect this only tangentially related to R-mac, but those that are  
using emacs to write/edit R code could find the following useful.

If you are using a UK keyboard layout and have remapped the standard  
emacs keybindings so you can use the standard OSX ones to manipulate  
text you are likely to have lost the <alt>  <3> key sequence to  
produce the comment symbol #.

To remap it to F5 I used the following lisp:

(global-set-key [f5] '(lambda() (interactive) (insert-string "#")))

in my .emacs file, and now I can carry on using emacs to tinker with  
my R source code.

Regards,

Federico Calboli

You probably want it to do "##", which is "indent to current indentation"

("#" is "indent to the right side")
("###" is "indent flush left")

But maybe you don't.

I don't. All I wanted was a good old hash (#) so I could comment my  
code, and I lost it with the OSX like keybinding. I hate lisp, and  
finding a way of getting the hash back was not trivial. I hope this  
post will save some time for people who have/will have the same problem.

Cheers,

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] crash when DVD in laptop
Message-ID: <p06230900bf0d6581660e@[128.200.28.216]>

All:

	My version of R crashes upon start-up if there is a DVD in my 
laptop.  The DVD does not have to be playing.  This problem seems 
quite reproducible.  My tiger upgrade was a clean install.  Obviously 
I can run R by just not having a DVD in the drive...but I am curious 
as to if I am the only one seeing this behavior.  R was installed 
from the binary...

The background is that there was a missing nil pointer as the  
termination of an array, so if R was lucky enough to be started in a  
clean "zeroed" memory, it worked. If the memory wasn't zeroed, it  
crashed. This can be affected by many factors and the DVD is just one  
of many random factors.

Cheers,
Simon

Would you recommend all Tiger users to install it/unistall the CRAN
binary?

You don't have to uninstall anything - the image above just contains  
the R.app so all you have to do is to either use it right-away from  
the image (or anywhere else you copy it to) or drop it in / 
Applications and thus replace the CRAN version - it's all up to your  
taste. As of what changed since the release, see
https://svn.r-project.org/R-packages/trunk/Mac-GUI/NEWS

Simon:

WOW!  Truly remarkable!  I was mostly just trying to document the 
problem in case it was a symptom of deeper problems, but this is 
incredible progress.
