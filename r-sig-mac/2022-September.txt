Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] loading tcltk fails in R 4.2.1 on macOS
Message-ID: <b3d4c0a6-4e95-1ddb-a2ab-b2ed5c9b52f7@mcmaster.ca>

Dear R-SIG-MAC list members,

Unless developer tools are installed, loading the standard tcltk package 
fails in R 4.2.1 on macOS because of the absence of otool:

------- snip -------

 > library(tcltk)
Error: package or namespace load failed for ?tcltk?:
  .onLoad failed in loadNamespace() for 'tcltk', details:
   call: dyn.load(file, DLLpath = DLLpath, ...)

I discovered this issue when a user (cc'd above) wrote to me about 
having to install the macOS developer tools in order to use the Rcmdr 
package. I didn't encounter the problem myself because (of course) I 
have the developer tools installed. I was able to reproduce the problem 
by dusting off an old Mac without R installed and starting from scratch.

I believe that this issue has arisen before, e.g., on R 3.1.2; see 
<https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-mac/2014-December/011260.html>.

Can this be fixed again in R-patched?

Thank you,

Hmm, that would obviously be a condition that developers would overlook, but the direct cause seems to be the absence of libX11.6.dylib. On the face of things, the otool business is just a warning. Was XQuartz installed and working? (Not to say that your diagnosis is definitely wrong, I don't have a system without otool for testing...)

John,

Please note that the error is missing X11: tcktk requires XQuartz.

Dev tools are optional and help giving a better error if installed, but they are not required.

Cheers,
Simon

Hi Simon,

My apologies for muddying the waters. Yes, it's been so long that I've 
worked on a Mac without XQuartz that I forgot to install it -- even 
though the most common problem with the Rcmdr on Macs is failure to 
install XQuartz!

But there's still a problem: With XQuartz installed and without the 
developer tools, loading the Rcmdr or just the tcltk package produces 
the warning

Warning message:
In system2("/usr/bin/otool", c("-L", shQuote(DSO)), stdout = TRUE) :
   running command ''/usr/bin/otool' -L 
'/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/library/tcltk/libs//tcltk.so'' 
had status 1
xcode-select: note: no developer tools were found at 
'/Applications/Xcode.app', requesting install. Choose an option in the 
dialog to download the command line developer tools.

and, as this warning states, a dialog box pops up offering to install 
the developer tools.

I suspect that most users will respond positively and have to wait 
through a potentially long download, even though tcltk and the Rcmdr 
load properly if the offer to install the development tools is declined.

Best,
  John

Hi Peter,

Thanks for noticing my failure to install XQuartz. Simon caught that too.

Even with XQuartz installed, however, the absence of the developer tools 
triggers a warning on loading tcltk, and a dialog box pops up offering 
to install the developer tools -- even though these aren't necessary for 
the tcltk package (and hence the Rcmdr package) to work.

Best,
  John

John,

please file an R bug report. The code guards against the absence of /usr/bin/otool, but it doesn't guard against it being a stub so I presume this is really macOS version specific so make sure you include the full details. Quick grep suggests that something similar is used for X11 as well, so it would make sense to clean it up - personally, I wouldn't use otool for this, but working around it is non-trivial, because any call to xcrun results in the dialog being popped up. (That said, this is very minor since user's response to that dialog is irrelevant, so I don't think this will be high on anyone's priority list).

Cheers,
Simon

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] netCDF driver missing from package terra 1.6.7 for Mac
Message-ID: <CWXP265MB40388F8B9C4CBA780F6C5577A77E9@CWXP265MB4038.GBRP265.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Package terra 1.6.7 for Mac (x86_64 version) does not have the netCDF driver.
I have checked with Robert Hijmans who confirms that this important driver is present in the Windows build, but missing from the Mac build.

Could the package be built again to include the netCDF driver?

Many thanks,
Dan Bebber

For the nonce you can get terra from r-universe:

> library(terra)
terra 1.6.10
> d <- gdal(drivers=TRUE)
> d[d$name=="netCDF", ]
     name   type        can   vsi                  long.name
91 netCDF raster read/write FALSE Network Common Data Format

This is on a Mac.
