Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] 2.8 problem: install dependencies hangs R?
Message-ID: <F07B1A46-2071-4009-AFDB-893BDCCB6949@ed.ac.uk>

I'm one of those who finds that updating R loses the user-installed  
libraries, and these need to be reinstalled.

Just moved to 2.8 ((downloaded 2.nov, thank you for work on this Simon  
and others!), and when downloading libraries with the "install  
dependencies" option in the gui (cmd-option-I), R hangs (spinning  
wheel of death) and does not come back.

Seems that grabbing packages one at a time works.

I can send you a sample trace if you wish

cheers,
tim

The standard explanation for this is that the GUI is unresponsive  
until all selected packages have been downloaded and installed - this  
may take quite a while. The fact that it works for you one package at  
a time corroborates this.

How do I locate and invoke the configure script on the MAC version of R? Is
there a config.site file?

Is this something that requires you to download the tar ball for R source
and not supplied with the dmg?

thanks!

  Hi, Peter
  I don't know why you have to invoke the configure script coz Mac  
version comes with the all-in-one .dmg file , so can u tell us what do  
you want to do ?
  just install as the regular mac software.

regards.

It's the same as any other unix - you just start it (e.g. /configure  
if it's in the current directory).

It is supported if you have one.

Depends what you mean, the dmg is the *binary* version of R so clearly  
it doesn't contain the configure script. Hence if you want to compile  
your own R form sources, you have to get the sources ;). (But make  
sure you read the R for Mac FAQ before you do that).

S

You installed a version built for R 2.7.x.  Where did you get yours from?

Under the CRAN build of R, you need packages compiled for the same y in 
2.y.z.  The version of RMySQL that I get from CRAN by 
install.packages() works for me.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] 64-bit build of R crashes while idle
Message-ID: <BEB54F6D-A602-494E-8A3B-6465278EDEBC@gmail.com>

Hi,

Early last week, I installed the 64-bit leopard build for R provided  
here: http://r.research.att.com/

I've realized that when R.app is running in the background (and  
sitting idle), it eventually beach-balls. When I switch over to see  
what's happening, I see that R is crashed, and it's giving me options  
to:

* abort
* save workspace then abort
* 1 or 2 others

Sorry, I didn't copy the issue down exactly because I hastily quit it  
and reinstalled R 2.7.2 to get back to work. I'm not sure if it's R  
itself, or the R.app GUI ... I can mess around w/ it a bit later next  
week once I get passed some deadlines.

I wonder if it's the R.app gui that's the problem, and not R itself.  
I'm running R 2.8 via the terminal now to see if it eventually hangs/ 
core-dumps/whatever.

Are other people working with 64-bit R/R.apphaving these issues? Is  
the best path to using 64-bit R via custom compilation? Maybe ignore  
R.app for now? What are you folks doing?

Thanks,
-steve

That is the behaviour of R's segfault handler, but from the log it looks 
like code in R.app caused it running in a callback from R itself.

I only use 64-bit command-line R and my own compilation of R.  The latter 
seems pretty much rock-solid.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] 64-bit build of R crashes while idle

Steve,

thanks for the report. At a first glance from the crash log it seems  
possibly like a problem in the OS and not R itself. Note that 64-bit  
Cocoa applications are still rare on Leopard, so I'm not sure how  
stable GUI applications are in 64-bit. As Brian pointed out R itself  
is solid in 64-bit, so if you have issues, you can always run 64-bit R  
on the command line (Terminal).

Nonetheless any feedback on 64-bit R.app is highly appreciated since  
not many users appear to use it. Clearly, the more feedback we get the  
better we can make it.

Custom compilation is not really necessary. If there are any issues  
with our build then it is likely to be present in all builds.

Cheers,
Simon

Note that the Leopard build contains both 32-bit *and* 64-bit, so you  
don't have to install anything special to get back to 32-bit - just  
start the 32-bit version of the GUI and you're set.

Cheers,
S

I knew I could switch between 32-bit and 64-bit versions of R from the  
command line, but I wasn't sure how to do it using the R.app GUI. How  
do I do it?

I feel like I remember reading somewhere that you can find a 64-bit  
checkbox in the "File > Get Info" dialog box to toggle 64bit apps. Is  
that it?

Thanks,

Each is a separate binary - if you start the 32-bit R.app you get 32- 
bit R. If you start 64-bit R.app, you get 64-bit R --- it's as simple.  
I recommend renaming the 64-bit one to R64.app to make it easier to  
remember which is which :).

Cheers,
Simon

Hi Simon,

Not sure if I use it as much/often as Steve, but 64bit R.app is up in  
an open space virtually all the time on my system using a recent daily  
'your' R and the GUI I build with XCode. Usually for several (2 to 3)  
days, used at least several times a day. If I restart R.app, like this  
morning, it'll select the latest daily build. Right now R 2.8.0 GUI  
1.26 unknown (5259).

All packages have been installed from sources. In the past that gave  
me some issues (as I privately mentioned to you). But since then I  
have tried not to mix binaries and sources.

Difficulties are in the well known 'suspects', Gtk2, Graphviz, rgl,  
ggobi, but otherwise I've seen very few problems.

On your system, does R-2.9 build in Xcode?

Rob

I really appreciate all the effort Simon Urbanek and others have
put into moving along the development and deployment of
64 bit R for Mac OS X.

I installed 64 bit R from  http://r.research.att.com/
using the command line approach:
  Leopard builds can be installed as follows - paste in Terminal (for R 2.8.x):
  curl -s http://r.research.att.com/R-2.8-branch-leopard-universal.tar.gz | sudo tar fvxz - -C /

I then installed R.app from R-GUI-5256-2.8-leopard-Deployment64.dmg
and installed a number of bioconductor libraries from source.
I advanced farther in getting 64-bit R and libraries up and
running than at any previous attempt, and thought I finally had
functional 64 bit R available on my Mac.  

But I keep hitting a tcltk problem that I can't seem to solve.
Whenever I'm trying to install a package that requires tcltk 
the installation fails with this message:

Loading required package: tcltk
Loading Tcl/Tk interface ... Error in dyn.load(file, DLLpath = DLLpath, ...) : 
  unable to load shared library '/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/library/tcltk/libs/ppc64/tcltk.so':

  Referenced from: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/library/tcltk/libs/ppc64/tcltk.so
  Expected in: dynamic lookup

Error : .onLoad failed in 'loadNamespace' for 'tcltk'
Error: package 'tcltk' could not be loaded
Execution halted

Any ideas on how to solve this one?  Any clues as to whether
I have set something up incorrectly?

(64 bit R on Leopard appears tantalizingly close!)


Details:
I also installed 
GTK+ 2.10.11 run-time gtk2-runtime.dmg
Graphviz 2.12 graphviz-2.12.dmg
gcc 4.2 
Dapple:gcc-4.2-5564 stevenmckinney$ gcc-4.2 --version
powerpc-apple-darwin8-gcc-4.2.1 (GCC) 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5564)

gfortran 4.2 gfortran-4.2.3.dmg


(also RSwitch RSwitch-1.1.dmg though probably not relevant here,
but I've tried to ensure that all of the myriad development tools
are installed as per instructions across the various R CRAN and
r.research.att.com webpages.)

Initially I installed several Bioconductor packages, 
using biocLite() e.g.
biocLite("beadarray", type = "source")

that all went well, with packages compiling with arch ppc64
etc. (R.app package installer also appears to be working
beautifully for installing packages from Bioconductor (source).)

Then a package needing tcltk capabilities tried loading the
tcltk library, and problems were revealed.  I have tried to ensure
that I have all tools related to tcltk installed but as yet to 
no avail.

Here is the issue I keep hitting:

Installing packages that don't require tcltk seems to be working
very well.  I include a chunk of output should it be useful
in diagnosing issues:

I know this doesn't really help you at all, but it seems that tcltk  
installed smoothly on my machine (Mac Pro) and I was able to compile a  
4-way fat binary.

In trying to be a little helpful, though ...

You don't actually need to install bioconductor packages from source  
-- they're already compiled as a 4-way fat binary for Leopard as of  
bioconductor 2.3 ... while it doesn't help you much here, perhaps it's  
good to know to save you install/compile time in the future.

Indeed, this issue is specific to ppc64. The problem is that it's not  
possible to build ppc64 binaries of R on an Intel machine so we have  
to use another machine for the ppc64 build and that machine didn't  
have the latest Tcl/Tk installed. This should be fixed now so please  
try the updated nightly build tomorrow.

Thanks,
Simon

"> You don't actually need to install bioconductor packages from source  "

Can Simon Urbanek weigh in on this?  
I've been keeping an eye on R-SIG-Mac and have been seeing
repeated references in the last few weeks about
installing from source for 64-bit R.

e.g.:
	 
Re: [R-SIG-Mac] /bin/sh: tar: command not found
 Kasper Daniel Hansen 	 Sent:  	 Fri 10/3/2008 2:43 PM

If you are doing 64bit computing you need 
to install from source.

PS: When you are using the Package Installer, make sure you select 
"CRAN (sources)"!

For some tangential weight, see this posting where Patrick Aboyoun  
answered my question regarding using 64bit bioconductor on os x:

http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.science.biology.informatics.conductor/20273/focus=20404

As a point of reference, although he doesn't list ppc64 there, looking  
through my d/l'd bioconductor I see most all of the packages have  
ppc64 builds in their libs folders. The only one that doesn't have  
ppc64 is `affy`, which is curious.

Given that limma and affy both d/l when you do a default BioC install  
with `biocLite()`, I'm not sure why that's the case.

but I have not yet seen any announcement that it is no longer
necessary to install from sources, and Patrick Aboyoun does
not mention ppc64, so I'd still really appreciate guidance
on this issue for Mac OS X Leopard for arch ppc64.

Steve and Steve,
While this is slightly off topic, I would just like to offer a brief 
aside since Bioconductor has been brought up on this mailing list. The 
Bioconductor project doesn't support ppc64 at this time and that is why 
I was silent on it in my e-mail to the Bioconductor community. We 
currently have only one Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard) build machine and it 
uses Intel technology. The reason why some of the BioC 2.3 packages have 
ppc64 binaries and some don't is because some packages with external 
source code let R fully control the compiler flags (like the one 
specifying the architecture) and others don't (e.g. because they include 
a make framework). For the ones that R has complete compiler flag 
control over, the BioC 2.3 Mac OS X Leopard packages contain all four 
architectures since we use Simon Urbanek's R binaries that contain 
quad-architecture support as well as the compilers he recommends. When R 
doesn't have full control over the compilation flags, we use a standard 
R-based compilation method to create the libraries that are appropriate 
for ppc, i386, x86_64. If there are others out there who are in the same 
boat as Steve McKinney and would like to use BioC 2.3 on a ppc64 and are 
having trouble doing so, let me know so I can pass that information on 
to the BioC core team.


Cheers,
Patrick

You can use binary packages with the Leopard build. If some packages  
are not available or don't work, feel free to fall back to  
installation from sources. As for ppc64 there is still the issue of R  
not supporting cross-compilation, so packages with configure script  
are currently available for i386, ppc and x86_64 only. There is a plan  
to build dylibs on a ppc64 machine and merge them, but I didn't have  
time to set it up yet. There are a few remaining issues with the  
Leopard build that I'd like to address before putting it on CRAN  
officially which are mostly related to dependent libraries.

Cheers,
Simon

This is slightly off-topic, but I could offer my ppc64 machine to  
build libraries for BioC binaries with configure script if that is  
desirable. According to the Mac survey there are very few ppc64  
machines with enough memory to warrant 64-bit R for ppc64, so it's  
still a questionable endeavor, but possible. (In fact I'm still not  
quite convinced that it's worth maintaining ppc64 binaries since G5 is  
now obsolete and next OS X reportedly won't support it anyway, but as  
long as I have a G5 in my office I'm simply keeping it in the chain).

Cheers,
Simon

Dear Prof. Murdoch,

the following worked on my system with the svn checkout:

/usr/bin/R CMD install ./rgl --configure-args=" --x-libraries='/usr/ 
X11/lib' --x-includes='/usr/X11/include/X11' X_LIBS='/usr/X11/lib' -- 
with-gl-libs=/System/Library/Frameworks/OpenGL.framework/Libraries"


I had to use the svn, because the tarball available from the download  
was somehow broken

tar -xvzf rgl_0-1.81.713.tar.gz
tar: This does not look like a tar archive
tar: Skipping to next header
tar: Error exit delayed from previous erro

Updated nightly build no longer has the TclTk
problem, packages are installing properly.
Thanks very much for the fix.

Indeed, this issue is specific to ppc64. The problem is that it's not  
possible to build ppc64 binaries of R on an Intel machine so we have  
to use another machine for the ppc64 build and that machine didn't  
have the latest Tcl/Tk installed. This should be fixed now so please  
try the updated nightly build tomorrow.

Thanks,
Simon

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] 64 bit R tcltk library problem: Symbol not found:
 _Tk_Init
In-Reply-To: <0BE438149FF2254DB4199E2682C8DFEB0328A4CA@crcmail1.BCCRC.CA>
Message-ID: <C539E227.1C37A%engrav@u.washington.edu>

In December 2007 I put 64bit on a PPC (And in fact you helped me)

Anyway I encountered the same error
And can't remember the exact fix
And am now on Intel 64bit Leopard

But I vaguely remember a path problem

It you follow the path
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/library/tcltk/libs/ppc64/tcltk.so
does the file tcltk.so exist at that location?

If so if in terminal you cd to /usr/local/bin
Does R -> /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/R exist at that
location?

And if in terminal you echo $PATH
Does /usr/local/bin show up?

I remember having to be sure usr/local/bin had the right stuff and that
everything knew where everything else was located

Binary packages for Mac OS X are expected to have the extension .tgz  
so the above is not a valid binary package (see 6.3.2 in R-admin).

In addition binary packages for Mac OS X are expected to have the  
filename packageName_version.tgz, therefore files with platform  
designation are not supported, either. This is different from other  
unix systems. I have relaxed the requirements for  
install.packages(,repos=NULL) in R-devel but I would still strongly  
recommend to adhere to the above rules.

Cheers,
Simon

I know :-), I should just learn AquaMacs w/ ESS,  but I am comfortable 
w/ TextWrangler.  So, just thought I'd put a shout out to see if anyone 
would like to write a plugin that would let the user execute code (in 
R.app) from a TextWrangler window.

If not, well, I'll live :-0

I think that's already possible - R.app supports AppleScript exactly  
for that purpose (and know quite a few people that are using it).  
However I'm not using it so I leave it to those who are to post the  
instructions ;)

Just to be clear, will using 'R CMD build --binary packageName' then  
renaming the resulting file 'packageName_version.tgz' yield a valid  
binary package for Mac OS X?

Thanks,
Kjell

You might see if you can simply modify the Apple Scripts used by Stata  
BBedit or TextWrangler folk:

http://fmwww.bc.edu/repec/bocode/t/textEditors.html

HEre is an exmaple:

(*
	Send file to Stata from within TextWrangler
	Requires log to be opened manually - no big deal, right?
	J. Gardner
	dataninja.wordpress.com
	dataninja at gmail.com
*)
tell application "BBEdit"
	set loc to file of window 1
	--set ploc to POSIX path of loc
end tell
tell application "StataMP"
	activate
	open loc
end tell

You might be interested to know that TextMate has a pretty capable R  
bundle. I'm not trying to convert anyone to a new editor, but I think  
getting used to TextMate would be easier than getting up to speed with  
emacs if you're coming from TextWrangler.

I've dabbled with the bundle a bit, but I honestly don't use it  
(perhaps I should). I know you can do things like interactively send R  
commands to a running R process in the background, and has interesting  
ways to deal with Sweave docs. If you're intersted:

Here is a blog post/screencast showing some aspects of the R bundle in  
TextMate:

http://skiadas.dcostanet.net/afterthought/2007/02/21/r-and-sweave-in-textmate/

You'll notice it's quite old. The R bundle has been pretty much  
totally revamped. I can't find any new screencasts using it, but  
here's some talk about it when the new bundle was released on the TM- 
user mailing list (still, almost a year old):

Here is a small script that does the job. You can put it in Textwrangler
Scripts folder and assign it a key (like Cmd-R) in the Scripts palette.
Of course you need a working R.app but then it is very handy. You can
get the source file here: http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/JTHome/SendSelToR.txt

Thanks Brian.  Tried that just now --- and of course it didn't work.
(*Nothing* ever works for me! :-( )  In more detail --- I found that
I didn't *have* a .Renviron file.  So I created one, with the single
line

	R_LATEXCMD=latex

But I got the same error situation as before.  Is there any other action
I need to take to get the system to notice my ~/.Renviron file?

I checked that

	> Sys.getenv("R_LATEXCMD")

now does indeed return "latex".

Be that as it may, I tried the expedient of sudo editing the Renviron
file in R_HOME/etc/i386 and changing ``false'' to ``latex'' in the
definition of R_LATEXCMD.

And *that* worked, at least.

Oops, sorry, R CMD does not read ~/.Renviron.  You need to set
R_LATEXCMD=latex in the shell you use to run 'R CMD Rd2dvi'.

as R does read ~/.Renviron.

Message-ID: <02511076-6280-4AAF-A63F-73A49EC59DF2@alumni.rice.edu>

Let me summarize the best current work-arounds for  Microsoft Word,  
Open Office,
and several other applications

...until they can handle transparencey as the R App interfaced does.
The quick method and the higher-quality method.

This is useful for keeping a relevant command history and
summaries together with associated graphics.

QUICK WAY:
quartz(bg="white")
... plot command(s)
Focus on the quartz window
Copy to clipboard  or Command-C

Switch to Preview
Select "New From Clipboard"   or   Command-N
Copy         (again)

Switch to Microsoft Word (2004) or Open Office (my current favorite)
Find appropriate place (just after the command output that
you are documenting and any associated summaries)

Paste
(Resize object to 50% or so to conserve space in your summary.)

....
POSSIBLY HIGHER RESOLUTION WAY
For Open Office, one may also pull in a fairly well rendered PDF
containing vector drawings:

 From the R GUI:
Focus on graphics window (as specified above with "white")
Save the graphics as PDF

Move to Open Office, an then
Select Open
... in the dialog box,
Select your pdf file
ALSO select File Type PDF - Portable Document Format
     (far down the menu, currently at the end of the second "group"  
delineated by
     blank lines)

Now, Select All
Copy,
Paste into your Open Office Writer  document as above.

Note: When resizing an imported PDF object, one must also resize the
fonts using the Format dialogue.  (I.e., when resizing to 50%, change
all 12-point font characters to 6-point font).

Word will import PDF's directly but convert them to fairly accurate  
bit-maps,
not quite journal quality.

Message-ID: <EA913658-9BBF-455E-B436-9C417C5C28BC@alumni.rice.edu>

Emacs has a very useful command that allows one to clear the last
command from the console display, ... and only the last one.

prints with 100's to 1000's of lines of output (accidental or just  
incidental)
can be cleared.

Any way to implement this useful feature in the R-Gui ?
It would seem to be easy,
and would speed "experimentation" documentation (which I just described,
using Open Office.)

   The best reference must be "Introduction to algorithm" or "The art

Message-ID: <12A8FC4D0563D1468AD23AAAED861A3E0BB603@EMAIL02.pnl.gov>

Hi,

I'm trying to install rimage on a Mac OS X 10.4 machine.  I followed the
advice in previous R-help threads and got over the hurdles of having the
header files in the right places, among other things.  But I can't
figure out what to do with this error.

Scott,

can you, please, include sessionInfo() in your output? Without knowing  
what machine you're running on (and incomplete output you sent) I can  
only guess that you simply don't have universal binary of your  
dependent libraries so you cannot build a universal package (somewhat  
likely given that you're pulling in fink directories).

Cheers,
Simon

Here is the sessionInfo() output from my ssh session on the Mac:

Thanks, Scott. That shows that my guess was wrong :).
Please make sure you're using Apple's gcc: run "which g++" and make  
sure it's showing /usr/bin/g++ (in fact it's worth running  
system("which g++") in R to make sure R doesn't add anything). If  
that's not the case, please fix your PATH to /usr/bin before any other  
paths and/or move any rogue compilers aside. If that is not the issue,  
let me know.

Cheers,
S

PS: There is no need to use sudo if you are admin already. Using sudo  
is tricky as it makes it impossible for admins to update packages  
later without running as root which should be avoided  in general. The  
problem is that using sudo just once is enough to lock you in that.

The g++ compiler path was ok in both instances.  I also prepended
/usr/bin to my PATH as indicated below.  Still no luck.  If I try to
install using install.packages(), the process dies at trying to find
jpeglib.h (it's in /usr/local/include, and placing this in the PATH
doesn't seem to help).  If I execute setenv C_INCLUDE_PATH
/usr/local/include and setenv MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET 10.4, then I am
able to run the R CMD INSTALL command as far as is shown below.

Thanks for the advice about sudo; I think I'm already locked in to using
it.

Thanks for your help,
Scott

Marc,

On R-2.9 I can reproduce your problem. I haven't tried R-2.8, but I  
expect it will behave similarly.

For now, what seems to work is, after selecting the required color, to  
click the selected item box in the pref window, e.g. 'Background'  
before closing the color chooser or the pref window. Clicking the  
selected box item will remove the grey border around it.

Rob

Thanks for the suggestion.  I wasn't able to execute your last command
exactly as is, but after some trial-and-error, I got this to run as far
as it did.  Now there is a complaint about -ljpeg.  I copied libjpeg.a
to the working directory, and of course it is in many other places.  Any
more suggestions?

Sott:

sorry, the last command was meant to read

./configure --with-fftw-include=/usr/local/include --with-jpeg- 
include=/opt/local/include
cd ..
R CMD install rimage

Since the script is complaining about a missing libjpeg now, you could  
try adding
--with-jpeg-lib=[PATH_TO_YOUR_JPEG_LIB]
to the configure command line, e.g.,

./configure --with-fftw-include=/usr/local/include --with-jpeg- 
include=/opt/local/include --with-jpeg-lib=/opt/local/lib

Thanks, I can now get past that hurdle.  The compiler is getting through
some of its work, but it still breaks down as follows.  This is from an
R session without sudo, in a Mac Terminal window.

For brevity, the key lines seem to be
ld: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/../R.framework/R load command 14
unknown cmd field
/usr/bin/libtool: internal link edit command failed

Many hours later and still trying . . .thanks for your support!

Scott, can you, please, check that you have Xcode 2.4 or higher? (2.5  
is available)
Cheers,

I am running Xcode 2.1 (I've never paid attention to this before) and
Mac OS 10.4.11.  My machine is up to date according to Software Update,
and all of the references I can find for Xcode talk about Leopard.  Do I
need a more recent version of Xcode for Tiger, and if so, how can I get
it?  Or is my only option to get Leopard?

Apparently the latest XCode (3.1.1) requires Leopard, but you can  
still upgrade your XCode to the latest version that's supported by  
Tiger (which is 2.5).

I can't find an easy way to point you to the right page, so here's a  
rough approximation of what you can do to get it:

(1) You'll need to register for an ADC account (it's free).

Go here: https://connect.apple.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/MemberSite.woa
Click on the "Join Now" button, if you don't have a login already.

(2) Go back to the MemberSite url above and login w/ your new account
(3) Click the Downloads link
(4) Click on "Developer Tools" in the Downloads toolbar on the right
(5) Search for "xcode 2.5" and follow the d/l links.

You'll get a *.dmg with the updated xcode tools you can then install  
as usual.

That's way too old - R requires Xcode 2.4 or higher -- see R for Mac  
FAQ 5.3:

Important: When using binary R installation from CRAN, you must use  
Xcode 2.4.0 or higher (available from see Apple Developer Connection).


> My machine is up to date according to Software Update,

Software Update never touches your Xcode, you have to update it  
yourself.

You can get it from ADC: http://connect.apple.com/
Click on Downloads -> Developer Tools -> Xcode 2.5 Developer Tools  
(Disk Image)

Simon

Thanks, that did it!  The rimage package finally installs.  Whew, it's a
relief to get this resolved.  Thanks a heap for your help!

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] upgradeable R layout
Message-ID: <43A94F2E-D8FC-46BA-A089-DAFD8D5060D7@GMAIL.COM>

Greetings -- I'd like to keep my R on Mac in an upgradeable way. I  
noticed that currently all packages I installed from R.app are in the  
R.framework -- are they going to be clobbered when I replace R 2.7.2  
by 2.8.0?

At the same time with the upgrade, I'd also like to switch to 64 bit.   
One good page I found about it is

http://www.matthewckeller.com/html/64_bit_r_on_mac.html

It suggests that packages are installed into a separate directory by  
doing it from command line install.packages with a lib= parameter.

Now I'd like to install everything into a lib anyways, but preferably  
without having to specify lib= all the time -- is there a way to make  
my local location the default for install.packages?

Also -- can the R.app be tweaked to do all this, if I want to use it  
with the 64 bit and local install for packages?

The idea is to make upgrading R smooth -- ideally, it would do  
update.packages(checkBuilt =
TRUE) by itself as a part of the upgrade.

Are there other ways to simplify R upgrade on Mac and/or am I missing  
something?

Cheers,
Alexy

There are quite a few changes between R 2.7.2 and R 2.8.0

I abandoned my R 2.7.2 and have no regrets so far (but you
don't have to - you can have different versions and Simon Urbanek
provides a small RSwitch gui app that lets you switch back and forth).

This website is out of date because of the changes 
in place for R 2.8.0

For R 2.8.0 if you look into one of a package's library
directories, e.g. 
/MacintoshHD/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.8/Resources/libra
ry/Matrix

you will see a subdirectory 
/libs
which will contain further subdirectories (once you've installed for the
arch involved), e.g.
/ppc
/pp64
which hold the architecture-specific files.  So you don't have to keep a
64 bit version somewhere separate from your 32 bit version.  Nice.

I installed R from Simon Urbanek's website - always up to date - 
http://r.research.att.com/
using the method

Leopard builds can be installed as follows - paste in Terminal (for R
2.8.x):
curl -s http://r.research.att.com/R-2.8-branch-leopard-universal.tar.gz
| sudo tar fvxz - -C /

after setting up the various compilers and other software discussed
in the "Tools for R Development" and "Other binaries and tools"
sections.

Now you have R installed and it has all architectures ready.
(I've wrestled through 64 bit configure / make / install for
prior R versions, this is much better!  Thank you Simon Urbanek
and others!)

I then installed the 32 bit R-Gui and renamed it to R32.app.
I installed the 64 bit R-Gui and renamed it to R64.app,
so I can fire up either 32 bit or 64 bit (or both!) and
use the excellent package manager and package installer.
The package installer installs the package using the
architecture of the R-Gui it is invoked from, so architecture
is handled automagically.

With the R-Gui apps in place, you can install packages easily, they
are installed in their standard place and I've had no problems with
this.

Yes - one way is described above.

The only hiccup I encountered was a TCL/TK issue (now resolved)
but otherwise getting 32 bit and 64 bit R up and running
has been very smooth.  (Now the issue is that ppc64 is going
extinct in the not too distant future - time to put in a
request for an Intel Mac!)

Once you get set up as I have, you won't be missing anything!

Good luck

 One last bit - I set up a shell script in
/usr/bin

called R64

containing

#!/bin/sh
R --arch=ppc64

to allow easy command line startup of
64 bit R and to allow ESS to find
and start up 64 bit R sessions in Emacs.

Steven -- thanks a lot!  Now it's clearer what to do with the 64 bits,  
but still it doesn't answer the question of upgradeability -- meaning,  
you went ahead and installed a bunch of packages, then a new version  
of R comes along, and what do you do?

One way I can see handling it it with a local install, outside of the  
framework, and reinstalling with the command from the previous list --  
and you still have to do that.  Going over a list of 60+ packages in  
the installer is not really fun...

Cheers,
Alexy

With R 2.8.0, as with any major release change, structure 
can change substantially, including with associated software 
such as the Bioconductor set of packages, so I have not 
found a useful way to just put everything back that was in 
a prior release.

No, sometimes I'd rather be poking a stick in my eye,
but other things can make it fun, like remembering how
few packages were available with other commercial
statistical software programs, or how hard it was to
get technical support or answers about internal code
from their tech support, or how much money I had to 
spend ;-) while I install the R packages.  (Though
once I donated to the R project via PayPal while
nursing a new installation!)

I've learned that some R / Bioconductor packages require 
many others, and thanks to improved dependency checking 
and installation I can install e.g. snapCGH in the Bioconductor 
suite and get dozens of other packages installed as a side 
effect.  I can select several packages in the R.app and
click the beautiful "Install Selected" button, and mostly
it all works in one go, so I'm no longer typing in 60+ 
install.packages() at the command prompt.

Smarter people than I may have more useful techniques
for you here.  Sorry.

See the rw-FAQ Q2.8.  If you use a separate library tree for non-core 
packages (highly recommended), then all you have to do when you update R 
is to run update.packages(checkBuilt=TRUE, ask=FALSE) .  Simple!
(If you have a personal library, that is versioned so you need to do

cp -r ~/Library/R/2.7/library ~/Library/R/2.8/library

first, or move it if you are wiping out 2.7.x.)


Steven is giving 2.8.0 credit for a much earlier concept, 
sub-architectures.  The difference in 2.8.0 is that 64-bit 
sub-architectures were added to i386 and ppc in the CRAN distribution. 
He also has an unfortunate tendency to write '64-bit' when he means 
'ppc64' and not 'x86_64'.  I've been thrown several times when the issue 
was specific to ppc64.

The installation of the Tools is the sticking point:

I am attemptng to follow the directions at http://r.research.att.com/tools/

Checked Xcode and finding that it was 3.0 and seeing that 3.1.1 was  
available, download and installed  a 1GB file. Checked to see that  
Xcode.app had been updated.

Downloaded and installed the gfortran package from the ATT website.

copied "export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin" to Terminal line.

Followed "Tools on CRAN" link:

devpack4-darwin8-bin4.tar.gz was download via Firefox to /Users/ 
Downloads/ and automatically expanded to a folder with Library and usr  
descendants within /Downloads/ which I think is not the correct  
location. The contents of Library were apparently destined for / 
Applications/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/ so I dragged the  
fontconfig file there.

Viewing the world through the Mac Finder it is unclear where the /usr/ 
local folder contents are supposed to go. There is probably a Unix  
command that will safely copy the contents of the /usr/ folder  
currently residing in /Downlaods to where the "true" /usr/ folder  
resides. So I opened a Terminal window and typed:

cp  /usr/local/

Can I now just type:
cp /Users/davidwinsemius/Downloads/devpack4-darwin8-bin4/usr/local/* .

... and get all those new files put in the corresponding descendant  
folders?

That looks wrong to me. After having d/l'd the devpack to see what was  
going on, it looks like the archive is destined to be expanded at the  
root level of your system, meaning the Library folder in there should  
really expand into:

/Library/Frameworks/R.framework ...

Same goes for the usr/local/blah/blah stuffs: this should be in /usr/ 
local/blah/blah.

I'm not sure if there's any undoing that needs to be done on your side  
(doesn't seem so(?)). So, assuming we're starting from scratch: in  
order to properly install the devpack that is d/l'd in your downloads  
folder, you can type this in the terminal and all files will expand  
into their correct place:

$ sudo tar fvxz /Users/davidwinsemius/Downloads/devpack4-darwin8- 
bin4.tar.gz -C /

> Viewing the world through the Mac Finder it is unclear where the /

You can't see that folder, by default, via the Finder as its hidden.  
You can force the Finder to open it in a window a few different ways,  
though. One way is to open a new finder window, hit Cmd-Shift-G to  
drop down the "Go to folder" dialog (Also available via the Go menu),  
and then type /usr/local.

Another way would be to fire up Terminal.app and type:
$ open /usr/local

This isn't really a valid command, as cp takes two arguments. Maybe  
you meant `cd`?

> Can I now just type:
> cp /Users/davidwinsemius/Downloads/devpack4-darwin8-bin4/usr/local/* .

If you meant `cd` above, this command wouldn't successfully copy all  
of the stuff over to your directory, since you'll need the -R command  
to copy the directories over  ...

So, to re-iterate, all you have to do to get the devpack items  
installed in the right place is to fire off the `tar xvfz ... `  
command I listed above, don't do any more cp'ing or whatever else you  
tried after that.

Honestly, though, I'm tempted to provide a word of caution since it  
seems you might not be very comfortable using the command line (sorry  
if I'm making an incorrect assumption). You'll have to use `sudo` to  
get this to work, and may unintentionally blow out something in the  
process that could your system (the command I gave you is safe, tho (I  
just ran it on my system and I'm doing OK :-)).

Anyway, hope this helps.

Thanks, Steve.

You are perfectly within rights to question how comfortable I am using  
the Unix command line. I started on CP/M and PC-DOS and twenty yaers  
ago did my stats homework and thesis work on a VAX but have not really  
used CLI Unix to the point where I am comfortable with it.  I had  
gotten to the point where I thought I needed to ask a question. You  
are also correct that I was using cd rather than cp to navigate the  
directory tree.  I suspected that there was a flag or switch for the  
cp command and you offered one.  Your sudo tar <....> solution appears  
to have worked as hoped. Thank you very much.

No, they will stay in the 2.7 folder. You can re-install them for 2.8  
by selecting "Select packages from R 2.7" in the search field of the  
Package Installer and clicking on "Install Selected".

That page is dangerous and incorrect (see my earlier post about it on  
this list). I would advise users to be cautious about following  
instructions blindly, you better be sure that the person knows what s/ 
he's writing about. If you feel that some instructions on CRAN or the  
R for Mac Devel page are insufficient, say so here instead of  
speculating!

Several - see "At User Level" and "As defined by .libPath()" options  
in the Package Installer.

What do you mean by "all this"? It already supports an easy upgrade  
between R version and custom paths so I really don't see what you're  
missing.

NOTE: Most users don't need to even look at the tools page! It is  
there mainly to allow experienced users to pick and choose some  
optional tools they may like. If you are not sure that you need any of  
it, the answer is you don't. The first two items (gfortran and tcltk)  
come bundled with R so you likely have them already and the devpack is  
only for people that want to build their own R and re-create the  
environment that the CRAN build machine is using.

No, use the same procedure you used for the R installation:
curl -s http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools/devpack4-darwin8-bin4.tar.gz 
  \
sudo tar fvxz - -C /

This has been changed from a configure-time to a run-time search for 
future versions of R.  So even if latex is not found on the build machine, 
'latex' will be tried at run time.  Ditto for pdflatex.  Also, the error 
messages are now much clearer and put out sooner.

Hi,

I often used Sweave in the last few years, but today I could not get  
it to work. I got this in the LaTeX console:

LaTex error: file 'sweave.sty' not found.

I am not sure when I lost the ability to use Sweave but in the last  
4-5 weeks I reinstalled my OS (10.5.5), R (2.8) and LaTeX (from  
TeXLive 2008 using MacTeX).

In the past I had nothing special to do, Sweave just worked after  
Iinstalled LaTeX and R.

I use a MacBook Pro.

Thanks in advance,

Denis

What is 'it'?  What exactly did you run (in R or elsewhere)?

> I got this in the LaTeX console:

The filename should be Sweave.sty: do you have a case-insensitive file 
system?  If not, that is the problem: it is looking for the wrong file 
name.

Not finding Sweave.sty is correct if you are running latex directly on the 
file in R 2.8.0 (sic, see the posting guide).  You are expected to use R 
CMD Sweave, or Sweave() inside R. See the NEWS item

     o	The default for 'stylepath' in Sweave's (default) RweaveLatex
 	driver is now FALSE rather than TRUE if
 	SWEAVE_STYLEPATH_DEFAULT is unset : see ?RweaveLatex.
 	To support this, tools::texi2dvi adds the R 'texmf' directory
 	to the input search path.

which inter alia tells you how to get the old behaviour (and the bugs it 
caused).  The alternative is to manually add the directory mentioned to 
TEXINPUTS.

I am trying to install DASPlusR, which isn't in the repository, so the
package needs to be downloaded from CRAN.

I have downloaded and tried to install with the following result:

> install.packages(repos=NULL, "/Users/graham/DASplusR_0.0-2_R_x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz")
Error in gzfile(file, "r") : cannot open the connection

'DASplusR_0.0-2_R_x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz/DESCRIPTION',
probable reason 'No such file or directory'

I then tried downloading the zip file and got this message:

> install.packages(repos=NULL, "/Users/graham/Desktop/DASplusR_0.0-2.zip")
gzip: stdin has more than one entry--rest ignored
tar: Child returned status 2

This is R 2.7.2 on Tiger, if it matters, but I assume I have just got
some silly error here, and would be grateful if someone could tell me
what it is.

Many thanks,

Graham

You are trying to install a Linux binary package.

On the CRAN Mac distribution, set type="source" for a source package.

It's not on CRAN, AFAIK.  The Mac OS X link at

http://www.statistik.tuwien.ac.at/StatDA/DASplusR/

is broken.  Please report it to the distributor. You will need to get the 
source package.

You are of course correct, the page looked like a CRAN page and I
assumed the link had taken me to CRAN, but its not broken here, unless
you mean that it links you to the same package as the Linux link.
Though I admit I had assumed they might well have been the same set up
as Macs also use tar.gz.

I am maybe making the mistake in assuming that the packages themselves
are OS independent, and its only the archiving systems that are
different. Is there an actual install program within the archive that
is OS specific.

I shall contact the distributor as you suggest and ask.

Graham

That is what I meant.  'The Mac OS X link ... is broken' since it gives an 
invalid file for a Mac.

No, they do not: they use .tgz .

No, but the files _do_ depend on the package type (souce, win.binary, 
mac.binary.*).

Sorry for the lack of precision. Sweave worked perfectly within R. It  
is when I tried to compile the ".tex" document with LaTeX (via  
TeXShop) that i got the error message.

I don't know if my system is case-insensitive (Mac OS X 10.5.5), I  
think it is. More importantly, I wrote the error message wrong. I just  
checked and Sweave was capilalized.

I should have been clearer that Sweave worked well within R, and that  
it was my LaTeX installation could not find Sweave.sty. In fact I  
hesitated between asking the Mac-LaTeX  list or the Mac-R list, and  
decided upon the later because I felt more readers of this list use  
both R and LaTeX.

I guess my question becomes: why do I get this message from LaTeX that  
I did not get when I was using R 2.7 instead of 2.8, TeXLive 2007  
instead of 2008.

For now, I can keep working by placing a copy of Sweave.sty in the  
directory where both my ".Rnw" and ".tex" files reside.

And I've answered that in the NEWS section I quoted to you and the 
following para.  It is a deliberate change in R, controlled by 
SWEAVE_STYLEPATH_DEFAULT.

Put the following in your ~/.Rprofile (you might have to create this  
file) to revert to the old behaviour

Sys.setenv("SWEAVE_STYLEPATH_DEFAULT" = "TRUE")

And this question have been asked many times recently on various email  
lists.

I am trying to get StatET (an Eclipse plugin for R/S) working on MacOS.

I can bring up a functioning R console within Eclipse but have a  
problem with help().

If I set options browser="/usr/bin/open" and htmlHelp=TRUE, then  
help(name) brings up the appropriate help page in the default browser.

However, help() with no argument brings up help(help).   This is what  
happens with help() running R in a Terminal.  What I would like to get  
is the help index page which is at /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/ 
Versions/2.7/Resources/doc/html/index.html as when one selects Help in  
the R gui.

Is there any way to do this?

That works running R in a Terminal window, but in the Eclipse console  
I get:

There does not seem to be a .R directory at that temp location

I'm curious to see if using StatET is useful, too ... as this is quite  
eclipse/plugin specific, perhaps you'd get better feedback from the  
StatET mailing list?

https://lists.r-forge.r-project.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/statet-user

It doesn't seem like it has too much traffic, but there seems to be  
someone there answering questions.

Good luck!

I am enormously grateful for the work and effort that has been put  
into the Mac port of R and R.app GUI.  However, there are a couple of  
functions I miss from other versions, and I was wondering if there is  
an easy way to add them.

1) Under windows script editor, I was able to send a single line to  
the console via Control- R, which stepped the cursor to the next line  
in the editor.  In R.app, I have to execute and then step manually to  
the next line   Is there any easy way to have it step to the next line  
after executing. I don't mind recompiling R.app, which I do to  
reassign key bindings in any case, but I can't figure out how to  
modify this behavior (I am new to XCode, sorry).

2) bringToTop() would bring the active graphics window to the  
foreground, but seems to be missing from the Mac port. I've tried  
various ways of designating the active window etc, but none bring it  
to the foreground.

3) To get around (1), I tend to work with Carbon Emacs or Aquamacs.  
However, in R.app, I often use file.choose() for interactive selection  
of data files; this function does not work if called from within  
Aquamacs or Emacs. While the same can probably be achieved with Elisp,  
I would prefer the code be interchangeable.

I know these are very trivial and subjective deficiencies, but habits  
are hard to break, and I would be happy for any solutions.

I started there but they have no clue about MacOS.

I was looking for someone who might understand how this stuff normally  
works on a Mac and hence I might be able to see what is going wrong.

It is attempting to access this .R directory in the location defined  
by $R_SESSION_TMPDIR.   At what point might R be expected to create  
that?   When I run R in a Terminal these directories get created.

Cheers

Oh ... I didn't see any messages related to this in their archives, so  
I thought maybe you didn't find them, sorry.

When you create a run config for R (Run > Run Confgurations ...), in  
the "Main" tab, you have a drop down box with "Launch" options. The  
Rterm option works, the RMI/JRI option doesn't.

Ideally I guess we want RMI/JRI ... here's what happens.


Launch R w/ Rterm
===============

I added --no-save in the Options/Arguments box, but I'm not sure that  
matters, anyway, when you run the config, this works:

R> > Sys.getenv('R_SESSION_TMPDIR')
Sys.getenv('R_SESSION_TMPDIR')
                                                R_SESSION_TMPDIR
"/var/folders/kL/kLbJmLNyEWa6w5gv6nb60U+++TI/-Tmp-//Rtmpp01O7b"

R> help.start()
help.start()
Making links in per-session dir ... done
If '/usr/bin/open' is already running, it is *not* restarted, and you
     must switch to its window.
Otherwise, be patient ...

# Browser pops up with the page you want

Launch R w/ RMI/JRI
=================

Yes: bizarre. I can't get anything to work.

I can effectively get the R_SESSION_TMPDIR to be "what I want" by  
setting the TMPDIR environment variable in the Run config's  
Environment tab. For instance, I have TMPDIR set to "/Users/stavros/ 
tmp". The R_SESSION_TMPDIR var is then:

R> Sys.getenv('R_SESSION_TMPDIR')
                R_SESSION_TMPDIR
"/Users/stavros/tmp/RtmpS1zNun"

I'm still getting some the same errors, though, as the R process isn't  
making the required directories. I wonder if it has something to do w/  
java communicating the R process via RMI ... I don't really know.

> It is attempting to access this .R directory in the location defined  
> by $R_SESSION_TMPDIR.   At what point might R be expected to create  
> that?   When I run R in a Terminal these directories get created.

So, after playing w/ this for a bit, I guess that:

(1) The $R_SESSION_TMPDIR is just created by monkeying with the  
environments defined TMPDIR variable, which we can change in the Run  
config's settings (like above)

(2) The "RtmpS1zNun" is created when R starts up
(3) The .R directory is then created after help.start() is executed.

I got (2) and (3) when running from the Terminal.

You know: I think I've realized what's going on, and I'm not sure how  
to fix it. It looks as if the running R process doesn't have the  
appropriate R environment variables set. For instance, in the RMI/JRI  
mode, look:

R> Sys.getenv('USER')
USER
   ""

Likewise, the "help-links.sh" (in "/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/ 
Versions/2.8/Resources/share/sh") script that the help.start()  
function uses requires environment variables like "R_DOC_DIR",  
"USER_R_HOME", to be set. All of these are empty. I tried setting the  
"R_DOC_DIR" to the appropriate location in the Run config's  
environment tab, but that's still not enough.

I can't really spend much more time on this now, but I think the  
problem is somewhere buried in there ...

You have to use the GTK+ build that we are using (X11 build), because  
the build from gtk-osx.org is still far from being stable.
You can download our build from
http://r.research.att.com/libs/

Eg. in Terminal:

curl -s http://r.research.att.com/libs/GTK+_2.14.3-X11-darwin8-bin2.tar.gz 
  \
sudo tar fvxz - -C /

An installer (.pkg in .dmg) should be available very soon.

S

Apparently the way Eclipse is starting R is wrong. The recommended way  
is to use the R shell wrapper even with JRI -- usually "R CMD foo"  
will do the trick where foo is the script that starts Java.

The 'make clean' problem on systems with sub-architectures is indeed covered
in R 2.9.0 (those builds use R 2.9.0 from 2008-11-02 r46816):

Thanks for the fix.

However, I can properly load lme4 from Aquamacs via ESS and from

Does anyone know what I need to do?

You are picking up a very ancient binary for R 2.5.0 (as you can see  
from the error). Check your .libPath() for old package binaries and  
remove/reinstall them.

You are picking up a very ancient binary for R 2.5.0 (as you can see  
from the error). Check your .libPath() for old package binaries and  
remove/reinstall them.

Cheers,

Am I correct in thinking then that's it this old version of lme4 that  
I have installed?  This version is from 14 October 2007 but I need  
this specific version for a course I'm taking.
Thanks,
Chrins

Yes, it appears so. You cannot use such an old version (binary) with  
the current R. For the course it should not matter which version you  
are using.
If you feel brave, you can try to compile the old version from sources  
in the new R (download the source .tar.gz file and use R CMD INSTALL  
to install it). It may not work because old versions are not designed  
to work in new R versions, but you can try your luck if you really  
can't live with the new version.

Cheers,
S

Thanks.  What I am still a bit confused about is why it loads in  
Aquamacs and from Terminal but not from R.app GUI.  This still seems  
like a bit of a mystery to me.

This probably wont work unless the Matrix package is also recompiled.

Because you have set different library paths in each.  
Check .libPaths() as I was suggesting in the first e-mail.

R in Terminal, R in Aquamacs, and R in R.app GUI all point to the same  
location as specified by .libPaths() that is

 > .libPaths()
[1] "/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/library"

They all give this location when I run .libPaths()

I am sure I'm missing something, I appreciate your help!
Thanks,
Chris

Sorry if this is an  old issue; it's certainly of very low priority.

I was playing around w/ font colors for, e.g. the main title in a plot, 
and noticed that overwriting some text with the identical text, but in 
white, leaves a small but noticeable 'border' outlining each letter.  I 
played around a bit with overwriting plotted lines in the chart and 
didn't seem to see this effect.  Is this a known limitation on rendering 
fonts or some such?


thanks
Carl

It is the expected consequence of anti-aliasing. Since the edges of  
the text are not fully opaque (more precisely the pixels that are not  
entirely filled by the text glyph), they won't entirely mask what's  
underneath and thus any previous content (including perviously drawn  
text) will shine through (c.f. plotting text with alpha < 1). This is  
an intended behavior for semi-opaque drawing although less intuitive  
when the opacity is implicitly adjusted by anti-aliasing. You can  
avoid this effect by disabling anti-aliasing (at the cost of inferior  
visual quality).

Cheers,
Simon

Thank you for providing us with your error. Is there anything you  
want? In case this was supposed to be a plea for help, 1) check that  
you have all necessary tools (see R for Mac FAQ), 2) check config.log  
to see why it fails and 3) consider using CRAN binary instead of  
trying to compile it from sources yourself.

Cheers,
Simon

The errors I get differ from yours (are your R and Xcode up to date?) but 
the problem is a fundamentally flawed Rcpp/src/Makefile. 
Here the lines I had to change (OS 10.5.5, R 2.8.0, Xcode 3.1.1):

PKGLIB          = Rcpp$(SHLIB_EXT)

$(PKGLIB):      $(PKGOBJ)
                 $(SHLIB_LINK) -o $(PKGLIB) $(PKGOBJ)

$(USERLIB):     $(USEROBJ)
                 $(DYLIB_LINK) -o $(USERLIB) $(USEROBJ) $(LIBR)
                 @cp Rcpp.h $(USERDIR)

But, I would not start from here, rather write a src/Makevars following 
the actual R documentation.  The package may compile on Debian Linux, but 
it compiles on none of my systems, not even the Linux ones.

David,

you may want to tell the maintainer (hopefully CCed here ;)). That  
package is horribly non-portable (for no real reason) so it's not just  
a matter of setting some flags to get it to work. (Re the message you  
quoted - It's not really excluded, it simply doesn't work).

Just to get you started, *remove* src/Makefile and create the  
following src/Makevars:

all: $(SHLIB) userLibrary

USERLIB=libRcpp$(DYLIB_EXT)
USERDIR=../inst/lib

userLibrary: $(USERLIB)
	- at if test ! -e $(USERDIR)$(R_ARCH); then mkdir -p $(USERDIR)$ 
(R_ARCH); fi
	cp $(USERLIB) $(USERDIR)$(R_ARCH)
	cp Rcpp.h $(USERDIR)

$(USERLIB): Rcpp.o
	$(SHLIB_CXXLD) -o $(USERLIB) $^ $(SHLIB_CXXLDFLAGS) $(ALL_LIBS)

.PHONY: 	all clean userLibrary

clean:
		rm -f $(OBJECTS) $(SHLIB) $(USERLIB)


Cheers,
Simon

See Brian's e-mail - it builds on very specific setups of some Linux  
systems only (Windows is a different story since you have a separate  
makefile for that and it's a closed system).

The R_ARCH part is just the icing on the cake - the main problems are  
hard-coding flags like "-shared", how to compile so's, wrong names for  
the package library etc. etc.
Using a Makefile is always a very last resort that one should take  
only if you are sure that you won't need anything from R (not true  
here) and you are really sure that you know what you're doing.

Small? Wow - it's a completely different approach...

Hm... I don't see any mention of 'altruistic' in the dictionary for

The reason is that I need to work around restrictions in R about how and I
where I can build libraries.  And e.g. the complete lack of follow-up from R
Core about the suggested additions to the R CMD INSTALL functionality (cf
r-devel in the summer).

Rcpp builds and works for me under Linux and Windows -- the only platforms I
have access too -- and I use it daily.  I had asked a friend who uses OS X to
test this, but he hadn't gotten around to it.  So OS X is simply untested.

On Windows and Linux I now install one copy of Rcpp and have other package
compile and link against it.

The platforms I work on don't need the $R_ARCH stuff which is why I didn't
add it.  If this is portable, we can surely talk about making it more
generic.  

If David is willing to test this, we can probably sort this out over a few
off-list emails. I'd be up for that.

That is overall a pretty small change.  So I don't see the need for the
belligerent tone above, especially given that I have no access to OS X.

Thanks, Dirk

I'm not exactly sure what's going south with your setup, but have you  
stumbled on Lingon?:
http://tuppis.com/lingon/

It's a GUI for creating/editing launchd config files. I haven't  
actually tried it, but it looks pretty self explanatory and might  
help. You have several options to choose from when making your new  
launchd config, but I suspect you can best decide what options are best.

HTH,

I think you're adding the wrong thing - clearly adding the R itself is  
useless since it will just show what you saw and exit since it has  
nothing to do.

I have still absolutely no idea what are you trying to do. R is an  
interpreter so running it on startup makes no sense unless you have a  
script to run. If you want to run the R.app GUI, that's whole another  
story and that should work just fine with startup items.

Of course, but this has nothing to do with R ... I suspect that you're  
mixing up several concepts here ...

Sure, but why would you do it in such a convoluted way? You can start  
Rserve directly right away (see R CMD Rserve) and you could easily do  
that via LaunchAgents ...

Perhaps this isn't the right place for this question but it refers to  
Sweave and it seems like what I would to be LaTex fixes don't seem to  
work and maybe it's something with Sweave so ...

When I want to use Sweave currently I need to do the following:
\usepackage{/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/share/texmf/ 
Sweave}

How can I set up aquamacs so that all I need to do is this?
\usepackage{Sweave}


Thanks!
Chris

Perhaps the simplest is to put Sweave.sty (and maybe Rd.sty) in your 
latex search path.  How to do that depends on your TeX distribution, but 
on Mactex I have such files under ~/Library/texmf/tex/latex .

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] installing R-2.8 from source - segmentation faults at
	make check
Message-ID: <6D5F5C61-29EA-4D23-AD88-9D6C259297C7@mit.edu>


I need to re-install R on my Mac Pro running OS X 10.5.5.  Because I  
work with large datasets, I need a 64-bit installation, and since  
there is no 64-bit binary available for Leopard yet (or is there?), I  
am compiling from source.  I am having some difficulty with this, and  
I am hoping that someone on this list can help.

The configure flags I am using are:

./configure SHELL='/bin/bash' \
r_arch=x86_64 \
CC="gcc-4.2 -arch x86_64 -g -p -std=gnu99" \
CXX="g++-4.2 -arch x86_64 -g -p" \
OBJC="gcc-4.2 -arch x86_64 -g -p" \
F77="gfortran-4.2 -arch x86_64 -g -p" \
FC="gfortran-4.2 -arch x86_64 -g -p" \
R_PAPERSIZE='letter' \
--with-system-zlib \
--enable-R-framework --enable-BLAS-shlib --with-tcltk --with-aqua \
--enable-R-profiling \
--with-blas='-framework vecLib' --with-lapack\

Configure and make run without errors, but when I run "make check," I  
get:

BRAUNM2: ~/Downloads/R-install/rd64 $ make check
make[4]: `Makedeps' is up to date.
running code in 'base-Ex.R' ...\c
/bin/bash: line 1: 69863 Segmentation fault      ../../bin/R --vanilla  
< base-Ex.R > base-Ex.Rout 2>&1

make[3]: *** [test-Examples-Base] Error 2
make[2]: *** [test-Examples] Error 2
make[1]: *** [test-all-basics] Error 1
make: *** [check] Error 2

If I were then to launch R from the command line, I get the following  
errors:

Error in capabilities("aqua") :
   0 arguments passed to .Internal(capabilities) which requires 1
Error : .onLoad failed in 'loadNamespace' for 'grDevices'

In addition: Warning message:

Error : .onLoad failed in 'loadNamespace' for 'grDevices'
During startup - Warning message:

Also, I cannot seem to be able to download and install any new packages.

I then tried a 32-bit build with the same flags as above, except  
replacing x86_64 with i386.  With the 32-bit, build,  make check"  
fails when it gets to:

running code in '../../R-release-branch/tests/lapack.R' ...\c
/bin/bash: line 1:  3900 Segmentation fault      LC_ALL=C SRCDIR=../../

make[3]: *** [lapack.Rout] Error 1
make[2]: *** [test-Specific] Error 2
make[1]: *** [test-all-basics] Error 1
make: *** [check] Error 2

However, I do not get errors when launching the 32-bit build, and I am  
able to install packages.

I should note that the only reason I am compiling from source is that,  
as far as I can tell, there are no 64-bit binaries available for  
Leopard yet.  If someone could point me to such binaries, that might  
solve my problem.

So, I'm not sure what's going on, and I'd appreciate any help you can  
provide.

Thanks,

Check out this page here:
http://r.research.att.com/

Primarily that blue box about 1/2-way down the page, that says:

Leopard builds can be installed as follows - paste in Terminal (for R  
2.8.x):
curl -s http://r.research.att.com/R-2.8-branch-leopard- 
universal.tar.gz | sudo tar fvxz - -C /

That should do the trick and save you the hassle of compiling  
yourself. ;-)

Hi Mike,

Just gonna CC the list back so that more people can chime in if  
necessary:

> Thanks.  I have been trying to access the r.research.att.com site

I'm not getting jibberish ... I'm also not having any problems  
accessing the r.research.att.com site, so ... is that still happening  
for you?

Anyway, an alternative you can try is to just d/l the binary directly  
using your browser, and run the necessary commands (the tar stuff)  
from the terminal.

That would look something like this.

1) Download the 2.8 binary using your browser by just dropping its URL  
your address field:

http://r.research.att.com/R-2.8-branch-leopard-universal.tar.gz

I will assume that you're using Leopard + Safari, which is important  
for two things

(i) It should d/l that binary into your ~/Downloads folder
(ii) it will automagically unzip the gz and leave you with the R-2.8- 
*.tar file (I think, mine does this automatically)

2) You'll have to unpack the tar archive *into* the correct location,  
which is the root of your system. That's why you need to use `sudo`  
and that's what the "-C /" is doing at the end of the tar command. So,  
now that you've d/led the archive w/ your browser, from the terminal,  
type:

$ sudo tar xvf ~/Downloads/R-2.8-branch-leopard-universal.tar -C /

Note that it's not "tar xvfz" since it's unzipped ... if your binary  
ends in *.tar.gz then you'd add the z

Anyway, that should do the trick, too, so let us know if that works.

Thanks, Steve. Just to add - this location of 64-bit builds is  
explicitly mentioned on the CRAN webpage:

"Information, tools and most recent daily builds of the R GUI, R- 
patched and R-devel can be found at http://R.research.att.com/. Please  
visit that page especially during beta stages to help us test the Mac  
OS X binaries before final release! The page also contains links to  
experimental builds as such 64-bit R for OS X."

Cheers,
S

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Does 64-bit R use multiple cores?
Message-ID: <CB172F71-7B4E-480E-8CA2-622D8194ABC3@gmail.com>

Dear R-mac Users:

I'm wanting to leverage an 8-core Intel Mac Pro for all of its  
computational glory. Looking over the mail list, it appears that the  
conversation on 64-bit builds of R has been about gaining access to  
memory beyond the 32-bit limit of 3.5 GB and not about multiple  
processors/cores.

Does running 64-bit R only take advantage of one processor core at a  
time like the standard 32-bit R, or does it do symmetric  
multiprocessing (is this the right terminology?). If no, is there any  
possibility of doing this using X-grid or otherwise that someone can  
detail? I do have 10.5 Server if I have to go down that road.

Thanks,
John

It depends on the computations you want to do.

R for Mac OS X uses Altivec which is a multithreaded version of BLAS  
and lapack. What this means is that for any computations involving  
matrix algebra, you do utilize multiple cores. Depending on what you  
are trying to compute and how that computation is implemented, this  
may prove to be just what you want or it may have little to no effect.

I thought Altivec was a ppc-only optimization. I'm pretty sure this  
does not apply to Intel systems, but maybe I'm wrong.

The Altivec part was incorrect but the multithreaded BLAS part was  
correct. Replace Altivec with your favorite three-letter code for  
Intel CPUs ;). [Not that Altivec matters in any way, since it supports  
spfp only which R doesn't use ...].

For more parallelization, see snow and pnmath by Luke Tierney.

Simon,

Thanks for this information. Some better googling this morning  
revealed snow. I will also look into pnmath.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Installing multiple architectures for a package
Message-ID: <0BE438149FF2254DB4199E2682C8DFEB0328A51C@crcmail1.BCCRC.CA>

Hi all,

I have set up both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of 
R.app and can run them happily at the same time.
(I'll refer to them as R32.app and R64.app)

However, if I install a package using the R32.app
package installer, then install the same package
from R64.app, the 32 bit version is removed.

Is there a way to install from R64.app so that
the *package*/libs/ppc64 directory is added to the
already existing *package*/libs/ and
the appropriate 64 bit file versions are installed
into *package*/libs/ppc64 without deleting the
whole library directory?  (At present each
R32.app or R64.app install deletes the whole
package's library directory so I only end up
with one architecture installed.)

I've reviewed the install.packages() help and
am not seeing a way to accomplish this via
the command line.  Did I miss something?
Is there a way to add an architecture to a 
package's already existing libs/ directory?

This is not about 32-bit vs. 64-bit --- this is about which build of R  
you use. The Tiger build supports only 32-bit, the Leopard build  
supports both 32 and 64-bit. It is irrelevant which architecture you  
use (32 ot 64-bit). You have to use the packages binaries for the  
correct build, but that should happen automatically.

Yes, if you install from sources use
R CMD INSTALL --libs-only

See R for Mac FAQ "5.4 Building universal packages"

However, you should only need that in rare cases (for packages with  
Makefile or configure script). Make sure you know what you're doing  
(please read the whole package installation FAQ section).

Simon

My apologies for 32-bit 64-bit nomenclature mangling.  

I have Leopard on my Mac (sessionInfo below), and 16GB RAM, 
and mountains of data to process.  So having 64-bit capability 
allows me to get lots of processing done that would otherwise 
be painful.

I use a lot of Bioconductor packages, but they are not
providing ppc64 architecture with their binaries.

In a recent email (Nov 6, 2008 - inserted at end of this
email) you kindly offered to compile BioC packages
so that ppc64 architecture would be available.  Will
you be able to offer this?  If so, where will those
binary packages containing ppc64 architecture be
found - at your website or Bioconductor?

If not, then I need to figure all this out.
It is very convenient to install the bulk of
packages via the R.app package installer, but
then I have to do the ppc64 architecture additionally.

Since I use many Bioconductor packages, this is not
rare, unfortunately, since they do not offer ppc64
binaries.  Not all CRAN binaries include ppc64 either.

It appears that if I install binaries from R32.app,
then I have to add the ppc64 versions via command line
R --arch=ppc64 CMD INSTALL --libs-only packagename.tar.gz

Would it be possible to add a --libs-only option
to the R.app package installer to help automate this?

Thanks for your guidance

Have you tried installing what you need? I was asked offlist whether  
there would be any point in installing the 64 bit version by someone  
who was using selected portions of the bioconductor suite. The entire  
biocLite superpackage installed from binaries under my 64bit GUI  
installation without complaint and ran a brief test suite. I still am  
not having that same error free installation with Harrell's Design and  
Hmisc combo however.

If someone on the list has had a go at figuring out what is stopping  
the Design and Hmisc packages from compiling, I would be interested.

Hi David,

What platform are you running on?
 
Yes, I figured out how to get it all done
yesterday, and now have a great R installation
with ppc and ppc64 architectures running well.
I spent the day cranking through HMM modeling
of bunches of Illumina chip data, which I just
could not do with limited memory or 32 bit 
software.

There's no need to install 64 bit stuff if
you don't have much memory or large data sets.

I'm not seeing ppc64 architecture when I
install bioconductor packages.  When you say
the biocLite stuff installed, are you saying
you have 64 bit architecture versions available?
I only see i386 and ppc architectures install
when I install from Bioconductor binaries.

Hmisc and Design are working fine for me, so
it can be done.  What error messages are you
seeing when you try to install from source?

Best

Steve M

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Can snow be used to multithread?
Message-ID: <C555B44F.AEC9%MAB@Stowers-Institute.org>

I am fairly sure that this topic has been covered before. However, I can't find answer to my questions in the archive...

I have a very embarrassingly parallel computing tasks (we are doing ~13,000 anovas and ~48,000 t.tests) that could benefits from using the snow packages parLapply() function.

Does anyone knows whether I could use MPI or PVM to send jobs to the 8 cores of my MacPro using snow or MPI/PVM has to be absolutely install and run across multiple machine. Is there an alternative that I could use to take advantage of my 8 cores with R?

Thanks

I am using TextWrangler, from Bare Bones Software. It is free and it
works well with R (you can add syntax coloring, and do command execution
through AppleSript).

Instead of screaming you should provide useful feedback so it can  
become better. I don't encounter the above problems, so I cannot fix  
something I cannot see... (and no one else reported this, either).
