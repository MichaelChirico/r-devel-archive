But then you are still using the Snow Leopard binaries for R?
I don?t know if stuff created with the older gfortran  will run with an R built for mavericks.

Two of my packages: nleqslv and geigen. They could not compile on my previous C2D computer with gfortran-4.8.
And another one: QZ.
And there are some more.
You would also need the Mavericks binaries of R.

Those were for local builds, which I suppose will by definition be Yosemite/Mavericks builds (laptop/desktop respectively). The corresponding C compiler is gcc, alias

$ gcc --version
Configured with: --prefix=/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr --with-gxx-include-dir=/usr/include/c++/4.2.1
Apple LLVM version 6.1.0 (clang-602.0.53) (based on LLVM 3.6.0svn)
Target: x86_64-apple-darwin14.4.0
Thread model: posix

The CRAN binaries of nleqslv seem to install, load, and run OK with the Mavericks CRAN binaries.

Source build of nleqslv builds, loads, runs with a local build on Yosemite.

In both cases, "runs" means that example(nleqslv) and example(testnslv) does something seemingly sensible and do not crash.

(Source build with Mavericks/CRAN would obviously fail due to the absence of gfortran-4.8 and I wouldn't even try mixing the two Fortran versions.)

I have now tried doctoring $RHOME/etc/Makeconf to use a MacPorts build of gfortran-4.8 that I had lying around, and lo and behold: It does source installs of nleqslv, geigen, QZ, rms with no trouble at all.

So I think the finger is pointing at the binaries on r.research.att.com/libs.

Good to know that.

Indeed as was confirmed by Simon last year here https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-mac/2014-May/010895.html
I can use the binary of r.research.att.com/libs since I now have a more modern Mac with an i5 cpu.

I did some searching and found the following:

http://coudert.name/software.html

and https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortranBinaries#MacOS

Might be a good idea to try these versions of gfortran too on a C2D.

Maybe the CRAN R could be built with one of these  gfortran binaries avoiding the need to compile an R provided gfortran and distributed on r.research.att.com/libs.
But that is beyond me and I have no idea about possible issues doing it.

Yes. However, I'll have to worry about overwriting and possibly breaking my build environment with 3.2.2 coming out next Friday (Simon's binary package rather carefully installs gfortran-4.8, but not gfortran, I believe. Won't know about the others until I try them.). So, not on this machine.

I haven't seen evidence that there is a problem with the CRAN binaries of anything and we still need to provide gfortran somehow for people who need to build from source. What we could try is to compile 4.8 on a C2D or cross-compile it for that architecture. I think that the latter is doable, but I don't recall the details (gcc --target ?).

Some further digging in the MacPorts fora suggests that gmp is the real culprit, but I'm not through digging yet. Compiling gcc 4.8.5 from source using the binaries of gmp-5.1.3 et al. from r.research.att.com dies with a "gfortran not working" message caused by the familiar f951 illegal instruction error. Replacing with 6.0.0 and retrying "make" didn't help nor did using gmp-6.0.0a compiled locally. However, starting all over after "make distclean" actually produced a functioning gfortran with gmp-6.0.0a. (Thus, it is possible that it would have worked with the binary of 6.0.0 too, if I had tried a clean build.)  

(Building gcc/gfortran from scratch literally takes hours on the aging iMac, so experimenting is, um, inconvenient... In comparison, building gmp was a piece of cake, so if that suffices, it would be great.)

I'll see if I can dig deeper tomorrow.

Sorry, I thought it was obvious so I didn't elaborate in more detail - our Mavericks compiler binary (gfortran-4.8) itself is using more advanced instruction set so it doesn't work on older CPUs (C2D as it appears). It's likely something to do with gmp/mpfr since those are the only ones that use hand-coded assembler instructions and they picked the one for the host CRAN machine with is a Mac Pro (Xenon). It doesn't have an effect on the compiled result since the flags govern that - so the compiled packages will work just fine on old hardware.

Given that anyone with older hardware should simply be able to use the Fortran from CRAN I didn't think it could spawn such a long thread ;). After all, the underlying GNU Fortran is the same anyway.

Cheers,
Simon

Hello,

I'm having trouble getting X11 support to work.  I have XQuartz 2.7.7
installed.  I've tried installing the R for Mac binaries, with homebrew
from binaries, and with homebrew from source.  In all cases when I run R,
capabilities("X11") returns false.

X11() gives the following error:

How did you install XQuartz? It looks like it was via homebrew. The
only official supported one (AFAIK) is via the actual XQuartz package.
I'm on 10.10.4 with XQuartz 2.7.7 (from pkg installer) and R 3.2.1
(from CRAN d/l) and it works fine. I use homebrew for many
sub-libraries (like GDAL) but not for core stuff like X11 & R itself.

I have XQuartz installed via the official package.  I have X11 support
working now with CRAN's R.  I found that the error was actually different
with R installed from CRAN's pkg that with homebrew's R.  I just didn't
have the DISPLAY variable set, which was fixed with:

> $ launchctl load -w
> /Library/LaunchAgents/org.macosforge.xquartz.startx.plist


With homebrew's R, X11 support is not compiled in and the R_X11.so module
is not there.  I still haven't been able to figure that out.

Umm, the situation as I see it is this:

The R Mavericks binaries "hardcode" gfortran-4.8 in etc/Makeconf
Gfortran from CRAN is 4.2.3
It is not clear that you can mix & match the two gfortran versions
Users who want to compile Fortran from source therefore get binaries for
   gfortran-4.8, gmp, mpfr from r.research.att.com
This combination is broken on C2D machines

Result: confusion (+ for some, a welcome incentive to upgrade...)

If the fix can be as simple as editing Makeconf for a different Fortran (F77 and FLIBS entries), we should say so somewhere. 

Otherwise, I think it might be possible to "unbreak" gfortran-4.8 since the cause of the breakage is known. (I gather that it happens in something as silly as parsing floating constants in Fortran source, which at the very least can hardly be said to be a performance issue.)

The recommended gfortran for the CRAN 'Mavericks' build has always been 
gfortran 4.8.0: see the R-admin manual.

> It is not clear that you can mix & match the two gfortran versions

It does not always work, although as FLIBS is static problems are rare 
(but usually segfault).  And there are packages which gfortran 4.2.3 
will not compile.

AFAICS you only need the binary of gfortran 4.8.0, as the gmp/mpfr libs 
are statically linked.

We do, at 
https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-patched/R-admin.html#OS-X 
(although that was not current on CRAN when I just looked).

> Otherwise, I think it might be possible to "unbreak" gfortran-4.8 since the cause of the breakage is known. (I gather that it happens in something as silly as parsing floating constants in Fortran source, which at the very least can hardly be said to be a performance issue.)

As we no longer support multiple sub-architectures on OS X, the Apple 
drivers are not needed.  I would be tempted to move to the binaries 
provided by Fran?ois-Xavier Coudert via the GCC wiki (also mentioned in 
the current manual).

Argh, I missed that point because I went directly for a full gcc/gfortran recompile. This also means that you cannot fix Simon's gfortran-4.8 by replacing the libs, of course.

OK, but it is not really an attractive solution if it only works some of the time.

OK, I can try those on the laptop without too much hassle.

   - *OS X*: The easiest way to get SYMPHONY on OSX is through Homebrew. It
   can be installed with brew install symphony.

Do you have homebrew?

http://brew.sh/
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

Once the Symphony libraries are in place you should be able to install the
R version of it. Usually it's not always so simple though. I had issues
with the sound libraries in R. Lots of dependencies.

Caveat: I've never installed Symphony myself.

Now tried (4.9.3, and doctoring `R RHOME`/etc/Makeconf) and it seems to work. Only slight issue was that the package install required overriding security setting. Also, it clobbered /usr/local/bin/gfortran from my previous install.

Hi, using the sessionInfo() below I got the following error:

Error in file(filename, "r", encoding = encoding) : 
  https:// URLs are not supported

This is the CRAN binary build of R-3.2.2 beta for Snow Leopard.

I thought https urls were supposed to be supported in this version? The same command works in the same version of R on linux, windows, and Mavericks (albeit with a message on Mavericks and Linux saying 'https:// URLs are not supported by the default method: trying "libcurl"').

Maybe a misconfiguration in the way that the binary was built for Snow Leopard?

Thanks,
Dan

What does capabilities() say about libcurl?

That'll explain it. It can't try libcurl if it isn't there.

However, the Snow Leopard builds are being phased out (check out the note on https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/). It is not obvious (to say the least) that there will be a 3.2.2 version - the "3.2.2 beta" may just exist due to inertia.

I don't quite know the specifics, but I think the underlying issue is that it is becoming increasingly difficult to keep a build system running and updated on an OS that isn't even supported by Apple any more. There have been some silliness with linking libcurl on OS X, which makes it even less attractive to mess with the build setup.  

Of course, nothing is keeping you from making your own local build, perhaps using homebrew...

I maintain the bioconductor build system and we need to use the CRAN binaries, otherwise the binary packages we produce would not be usable by most people.

I understand that Snow Leopard is being phased out. However, this does mean that any package that relies on libcurl will fail on Snow Leopard (using the CRAN R binary) and so will all its reverse dependencies. 

Simon, do you have any thoughts on this? I know Snow Leopard is limping off into the sunset but I hope it can do so more gracefully. ;-)

A clarification, prompted by conversation with those who actually know about this: We can't "support" https: in the sense of making it work everywhere -- there are too many external entities involved, and libcurl support doesn't necessarily imply that https: works. What we have done in 3.2.2 is mainly to remove some stumbling blocks so that repositories can be accessed via https: *when that works* and ensure that there actually are HTTPS-speaking mirrors available.

Hi,

Very often R.app crashes when I try to open a file or to change directory. The problem started with Maverick and remains with Yosemite. What can I do?

Hi,
In R.app 3.2.0, doing

?function -> index -> vignettes -> pdf

R.app requests a version of Adobe Reader. I don?t have this installed, but all OS X users have preview.app

Could the help service be coded to either:
1. just open pdfs (that way they?ll be in a stand alone app configured by the user.
2. set preview.app as the default in-app viewer?

That particular horse has been flogged to death repeatedly over the last weeks. Please try 3.2.2 RC.

Tim,

I fear that it must be a setting on your Mac - the default is to show the PDF in-ine in the same window (which uses the Preview engine behind the scenes). I suspect that you must have installed the Adobe plugin at some point (or some Adobe software) - OS X doesn't know anything about Adobe until you install some of their products at which point it's actually really hard to reverse the changes their installers make.

Cheers,
Simon

bingo. Didn?t think of the plugin, as Safari and Chrome both open pdfs inline using Preview.app

The Adobe detritus was here if anyone else has this problem.

 /Library/Internet Plug-ins/AdobePDFViewer.plugin

thanks!

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] lme4/macos crossover question
Message-ID: <loom.20150814T184053-937@post.gmane.org>


As pointed out in this lme4 issue: https://github.com/lme4/lme4/issues/302 ,
lme4 is behaving badly on Snow Leopard, failing to find an
(apparently) exported function

urlhead <- "https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/R.check/r-"
urltail <- "/gamm4-00check.html"
versions <- c("devel-osx-x86_64-clang",
              "release-osx-x86_64-mavericks",
              "release-osx-x86_64-snowleopard")
checkfun <- function(ver) {
    uu <- paste0(urlhead,ver,urltail)
    rr <- readLines(url(uu,method="libcurl"))
    any(grepl("could not find function.*REMLcrit",rr))
}
sapply(versions,checkfun)

Here's the (broken to make Gmane happy) link to the bad case:

https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/R.check/
      r-release-osx-x86_64-snowleopard/gamm4-00check.html

The REMLcrit function is exported, at least in all recent versions of
the package (and we haven't been able to reproduce on any other
platforms).

Any ideas ... ?  Possibly the Snow Leopard test build on CRAN is
using an out-of-date version of lme4 ... ?

  thanks

I could not get those to run with method="libcurl", possibly since I have not yet updated to 3.2.2? This did run:

 checkfun <- function(ver) {
    uu <- paste0(urlhead,ver, urltail)
    rr <- readLines(url(uu))
    any(grepl("could not find function.*REMLcrit",rr))
 }

 sapply(versions,checkfun)

[R.app GUI 1.66 (6956) x86_64-apple-darwin10.8.0]

I installed today an updated macbinary version of lme4, lme4_1.1-8.tgz, which the GUI package installer did for me with all the many dependencies. That is the latest version at CRAN for SL:

http://cran.cnr.berkeley.edu/bin/macosx/contrib/3.2/

Is that version "out of date"?  I suppose it might be, since I see this at the top of the CRAN package check:

? using platform: x86_64-apple-darwin10.8.0 (64-bit)
? using session charset: UTF-8
? checking for file ?gamm4/DESCRIPTION? ... OK
? this is package ?gamm4? version ?0.2-3?

I get this at the console:

>  require(lme4) 
Loading required package: lme4
Loading required package: Matrix
> set.seed(0) 
> y <- rnorm(20)
> x <- rnorm(20) 
> g <-factor(rep(1:2,10)) 
> REMLcrit(lmer(y~(1|g)+x)) 
[1] 57.98661

I'd be happy to remove and attempt reinstalling from source something else if that would be of any use to you wiser folk, who know what you are looking for and only need cannon fodder, er, willing test subjects.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Two UI suggestions: 1. key bindings for help-page
	navigation buttons; 2: increase font-size of function status bar
Message-ID: <CACEAD68-0982-4475-BF6A-06E508F74882@gmail.com>

Hi,
A couple of minor suggestions for the mac GUI.

First, Help window back-forward buttons.

Often when the user has opened help, they want to navigate back a page.
Currently the back ( "<?  ) and forward ( ?>?) buttons in the help window lack key bindings. So one has to use the mouse to navigate forward and back.

Request: Could these keys be bound to "?-{" and "?-}" respectively? That would match how Safari handles this app (and many others that have followed it for history navigation).

Second, The function help bar (bottom of the "R console? window) is very helpful, but perhaps in too small a font size.

The font used is also smaller than Apple chooses to use for the comparable Finder folder-trail and selection status bars.

Could the font size/bar height be upped a couple of points (or perhaps linked to the display font size?

best, tim

I haven?t assigned any keyboard shortcut for Safari, The keys mentioned in Safari for me are: ??-[" and ??-]?
I would prefer  ??-[" and ??-]?  so that the Shift key is not necessary.

Sorry? typo when i grabbed the ? character: you?re right, it?s the non-shifted square-brackets.

On my machine OSX 10.7.5 with SL-vers of R 3.2.1, R.app GUI 1.66 (6956), the cmd-right-arrow and the cmd left arrow give forward and back behavior in the help page display. I see little value in assigning this also or instead of the current behavior. I discovered this by trial and error so it might be worth documenting in the OSX-FAQ document, although it seemed pretty intuitive and was the first thing I tried after seeing this request.

So it is. Not having this in any menu (unlike, say, those same keys for back and forth in the graphics window) makes it hard to discover.

Perhaps adding menu options for  ?Back? and ?Forward? in the ?Windows? menu, showing they are bound to ?-[ and ?-] would enable discovery.

Anyone have thoughts on the function-bar help size?

Very small. I can only just about read it:-). But not always.
I wouldn?t mind something larger.

May I suggest an alternative?   Since MacOS allows you to bind the 
keystroke of your choice to any menu item (on an app-specific basis), 
if the "help/forwards" and "help/backwards" were added to a menu, then 
everyone could set whatever bindings they prefer.

Yes, <Cmd><Left> and <Cmd><Right> is the default behavior in all browsers, including Safari. Since we simply use WebKit, we get that default, so it's consistent. Also not that it works in the absence of any buttons.

The <Cmd><[>/<]> in interesting - I have never used it and wasn't aware of it, since IMHO the more intuitive way above works. Given that we don't explicitly define any key equivalent, we could add those to the buttons if people are interested.

The GUI has been designed so long ago, that all our helper windows share the same main menu, so we don't actually have menu items for individual navigation, so there is no good place where to put the information about the available key bindings.

It was deliberately chosen to be so small, as to fit two lines of help. However, you're right that the hardware has evolved since this was done in a  way where the effective size becomes increasingly smaller, so it may make sense to increase the size of the status bar along with the font size.

Simon

The Safari History menu displays those two key equivalents (and not the other above mentioned two). At least on my OS X and Safari.
I wouldn?t mind those key equivalents. I find them less contorted than the <CMD><Left> and <CMD><Right>

I noticed this today too. It links to 3.2.1, but if you change the 1 to 2
you can download the correct package. Obviously not ideal, but something.

Heh, in this case, just my bad - forgot to fix the href when releasing the binary yesterday - it was reported earlier today and fixed, but it takes a bit of time until things propagate.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] keeping two patch level releases of the same minor
	release installed
Message-ID: <638E44E3-2951-47F5-81CE-A08935A8B2B9@gmail.com>

Hello,

I use Rswitch in conjunction with CRAN installers to keep different minor releases series (e.g. 3.2.X vs 3.1.X) installed.

Now I find that I want to install 3.2.2 and 3.2.1 at the same time, so I tried

  pkgutil --forget org.r-project.R.mavericks.fw.pkg

on install, but 3.2.1 disappears, presumably because the contents of /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/ looks like this:

3.1	3.2	Current

Can anyone suggest an easy way to keep and switch between the patch level releases?

With many thanks,

Greg.

Idea: Install one, move it to to 3.2.1 instead of 3.2, then use --forget, install second one and move it to 3.2.2. Then always create a symlink from 3.2 to either 3.2.1 or 3.2.2 depending on what you want to use. It's the same trick as Current except one level deeper. Note that you'll still have separate package trees for better or worse. I didn't actually test it, but in principle it should work.

Cheers,
Simon

Dunno, it works fine for me, at least on Mavericks 10.9.5.

However, the reference to Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.1/... makes me suspect that you are somehow mixing versions. Perhaps clean up and reinstall?

       Thanks.  Now I can't find a way to start R at all outside of 
RStudio after uninstalling and reinstalling.


       What do you suggest I try next?


       Thanks,
       Spencer


p.s.  To be precise, I ran the following as described in "4.2 
Uninstalling under OS X" in "R Installation and Administration":


             ..$ sudo rm -rf /Library/Frameworks/R.framework
             ..$ sudo rm -rf /Applications/R.app
             ..$ sudo rm -rf /usr/bin/R
             ..$ sudo rm -rf /usr/bin/Rscript


       Then I double-clicked on "R-3.2.2.pkg" in Downloads.  R seemed to 
install, and R 3.2.2 started as expected under RStudio, but I couldn't 
find stand-alone R icons.  So I upgraded to 10.10.5 and double-clicked 
again on "R-3.2.2.pkg".  That didn't help.  FYI, from within RStudio, I 
get the following:

Spencer,

use

open -a R

in Terminal or use Spotlight to look for R (the application) - you have probably moved it someplace non-default and unfortunately Apple's Installer is doing a really good job in upgrading the R.app that you have assigned last and apparently it's not the one in Applications.

Cheers,
Simon

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] "Layout still needs update ..." in R.app on OS X
	Yosemite
Message-ID: <D33C739D-D8CE-4929-9077-A7E82CC8FD87@xs4all.nl>


I?m running

R version 3.2.2 Patched (2015-08-14 r69078) -- "Fire Safety?
[R.app GUI 1.66 (6996) x86_64-apple-darwin13.4.0]

on OS X Yosemite 10.10.5. This is the Mavericks build.

After starting R.app and issuing CMD+, to access the Preferences. and closing the preferences window I get this error message (coloured red):

2015-08-23 21:31:21.633 R[2079:87205] Layout still needs update after calling -[NSScrollView layout].  NSScrollView or one of its superclasses may have overridden -layout without calling super. Or, something may have dirtied layout in the middle of updating it.  Both are programming errors in Cocoa Autolayout.  The former is pretty likely to arise if some pre-Cocoa Autolayout class had a method called layout, but it should be fixed.

The message is not issued again when repeating the above procedure but is issued if I access preferences after issuing a valid R command.

Could someone throw some light on this?

The page lists R-devel as r69167, but r69078 is instead delivered from
http://r.research.att.com/mavericks/R-devel/R-devel-mavericks-signed.pkg.
This seems to be the case for R-patched and friends as well.

there was a problem with disks on that machine that has been fixed yesterday - I think that should have also fixed the issue you're describing.

The code hints appear to be not working properly for me. In both the
editor window and in R GUI I see the subject line in parentheses
rather than the usual helpful text indicating what variables are
acceptable in a particular function.
Tab autocompletion is also non-functioning.

Any pointers?

Yes, that is expected, since you need R to obtain those (it requires R code to run) and R is single-threaded, so you get all those hints only when R is not busy.

Cheers,

At the time I wasn't doing anything. The editor window was open and
the GUI window was waiting for input. It was working fine in Rstudio
so I switched briefly, and now after a few power cycles it's like it
was. Not sure what I did, but I guess it's ok.

Maybe I was not parsing your e-mail correctly - the title says "arguments lookup is disabled while R is busy" which is expected. So how to reproduce what you describe?

Thanks,

Simon,
Wires crossed methinks.

I took a photo (imgur link in first message). In it you can see the
bottom of the editor window which says, "(arguments lookup is disabled
while R is busy)". While in the GUI window, it is the prompt ">". When
I switched to the GUI window, it would say that in the bottom of the
GUI window. The hints and autocomplete weren't working.

My point is that it wasn't busy doing anything and yet it insisted it
was. I closed and reopened R a few times and nothing changed. Then I
went to Rstudio, in which the code hints and autocomplete was working.

After a few reboots, it no longer does this and I can not get it to
reproduce using similar code ( I no longer have the original code I
was working with because I changed it too much).

The only thing I can think of is that during this session, I updated
from R 3.2.1 to 3.2.2 and also updated a lot of packages. Perhaps a
reboot was in order?

Sorry for the noise.
Brandon

Hi Christopher,

I just came across your post online concerning R freezing. I?ve been having this same problem for many months now over multiple machines. Did you ever find a satisfactory answer for this issue?


Cheers,

Vincent

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Error loading packages
Message-ID: <CAJGTHn0Hi=MBrmZt6frDXQG6OQn-SLc9Lno63-AT47vAXjHxog@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
I'm not having any luck loading two packages, ggplot2 and psych so I'm not
sure if this is Mac specific or Rapp specific. When trying to load the
packages, I get the below error messages, highlighted in bold. I have tried
installing and loading the package asked for (in this case 'munsell'), but
the same error message will appear, with a new/different package name. I
have uninstalled and reinstalled R and the packages themselves, and from
several different mirrors. I had the same issue on R v3.2.1. I'm not sure
what else to try, or how many other packages are affected. Thanks for any
help you can give me. My script and session info are below.

For R "Fire Safety", v3.2.2.

Hi,

Very often R.app crashes when I try to open a file or to change directory. The problem started with Maverick and remains with Yosemite. What can I do?

Thanks

Gregorio
