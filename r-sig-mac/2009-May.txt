use the mac version directly (a dmg file), no need to use windows on a  
mac for this.

Mito,

	How often do you use winBUGS?  That is the only major disadvantage  
that I have come across,
winBUGS doesn't work on a mac and thus the R-winBUGS interface is  
useless on a mac.
If you use the R.app, instead of command line, then it is about 1000x  
better on a mac than windows
machine (no exaggeration :) ).  The quartz and pdf interfaces are a  
lot nicer and generally render much better
on screen, hence you have greater ability at making real nice plots,  
rather than guessing.  If you ever
have any trouble with other packages not loading on a mac, simply load  
them as source (.tar.gz) and they
will work fine.

My two cents.

Said incomplete by whom? And in what way?

R on the Mac is complete.

With regard to R extensions (not R itself, but extensions), there are 
some, only a few, I believe, packages not available as binary 
downloads from CRAN.  But in all cases, I've been able to build or 
obtain the ones I need. There may be a very small number of packages 
available only for Windows.

I think all of the packages are available as source.  You can look at
?install.packages to see how to use this from within R or look a R CMD
install in a terminal window.
hope this helps,

In a very crucial way (for me anyway), the version selection for Mac  
OSX 10.5.x is **more** complete than for Windows because a 64-bit  
version is available. It runs beautifully and my only unsolved  
difficulties have been in getting RGL to build. I do not think those  
difficulties are insurmountable.

It would not make any sense to download the Mac versions through  
Windows, although it may be possible.

I figured that the Rcmdr wasn't directly implicated, but my guess was
that it was a tcltk issue, so this is very useful information. The
problem didn't occur for me outside of R.app, but then I wasn't using
the Quartz graphics device.

This "works" for me every time: (1) In a fresh R.app session, load the
Rcmdr, library(Rcmdr). (2) "Data -> Data in packages -> Read data set
from an attached package." Pick any data set. I used Prestige from the
car package. (3) Draw any graph on the Quartz device. I used "Graphs ->
Histogram" and selected education. Close the Quartz device, and watch
the crash.

I hope that this proves of some use in diagnosing the problem.

No -- this is more natural on r-sig-mac.

Hi John,

Thanks for your procedure to reliably 'crash' R.app.

On my system sometimes this leads to an immediate crash, sometimes it  
happens when I ask for a 2nd plot or use another application after  
closing the 1st graphics window. I think using Rcmdr creates a similar  
condition as sourcing a file with graphics commands from TextMate.

As a workaround, in all cases, if I go back to the R Console window  
and e.g. enter a CR that condition is 'cleared', closing the graphics  
window will no longer create an issue.

I've several times tried to track this problem down but never with any  
luck. I take it as another artifact of the way documents are created/ 
deleted in the current R.app.

Just to observe that WinBUGS will run on a any recent Mac using  
Crossover or the free WINE on which it is based.

Last time I looked, which was probably over a year ago, the R -  
WinBUGS interfaces did not understand recent versions of WINE, but  
this may have been fixed.

Alternatively you can use JAGS to run BUGS models on a Mac.  This now  
has an R interface on CRAN and will run in 64 bit even when used with  
a 32 bit  version of R.

Hi Rob,

Thanks for checking this out. I wonder whether it's worthwhile to advise
Rcmdr Mac users to avoid R.app, and instead to run R and the Rcmdr from a
terminal, since presumably they'll be making minimal use of the command
line.

Best,
 John

I know variants of this have been answered a few times, but thus far  
I've had no luck:

I'm attempting to install Rgraphviz from bioconductor.  I downloaded  
the stablemac version from http://www.graphviz.org/Download_macos.php  
and used biocite to install Rgraphviz after installing bioconductor.   
However, when I attempt to load Rgraphviz, I get the following error.

Error in dyn.load(file, DLLpath = DLLpath, ...) :
   unable to load shared library '/Users/jbyr/Library/R/2.9/library/ 
Rgraphviz/libs/ppc/Rgraphviz.so':
   dlopen(/Users/jbyr/Library/R/2.9/library/Rgraphviz/libs/ppc/ 
Rgraphviz.so, 6): Library not loaded: /usr/local/lib/libgvc.3.dylib
   Referenced from: /Users/jbyr/Library/R/2.9/library/Rgraphviz/libs/ 
ppc/Rgraphviz.so
   Reason: image not found
Error: package/namespace load failed for 'Rgraphviz'


I went to look for libgvc.3.dylib, and there in /usr/lib found libgvc. 
5.dylib .

Is the answer here to install an older version of graphviz? If so  
which one?  Or can Rgraphviz be made to work with my existing  
installation of graphviz?

Jarrett,
This is a Bioconductor related question and really should be addressed 
on the Bioconductor mailing list. The sort answer is if you are running 
on a Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) box, you will need to build both graphviz and 
Rgraphviz from source in order to use the package. If you are running on a
Mac OS X 10.5 (Tiger) box, continue reading.

The issue is that graphviz.org distributes their latest version of 
Graphviz for Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard) only and we use that when we build 
our mac.binary.leopard version of Rgraphviz. I am guessing that you are 
using the cross Mac OS X pre-compiled version of R, which uses the 
mac.binary build of the package from our Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) build 
machine that has an old (unmaintained) version of graphviz on it. I 
recommend that all Bioconductor users running on leopard to use a 
leopard-only build of R available at http://r.research.att.com/, since 
that is what we use on our build machine. These leopard only R binaries 
download, via biocLite, mac.binary.leopard versions of the packages that 
are produced by our Leopard machine. These leopard only binaries have 
the added benefit of 64-bit Intel support so end-users don't have to 
build their own packages once they leave the 32-bit world.

Using 10.5.5 and R.app 2.8.0 and MBP and MP

All seems to work fine but I have .Rhistory and .Rdata invisible files all

Can I have one of each in a known place? Is this described somewhere?

Also
In Preferences if I set R history file to ~/.Rhistory and then click on any
checkbox the ~/ is removed.  How do I stop this? Described somewhere?

Yes, you can, see notes on the preferences page.

'Always apply' will help with.RData.

For .Rhistory use e.g. the setting you're trying to get accepted below.

Did you type a return after modifying the field (before clicking on  
any other
checkbox)?

Thank you
The return before clicking anywhere else solved that problem, clever

So I trash all invisible .Rhistory and .Rdata files
Then made a new folder (called R_History_Data) and aim Preferences at this
folder (using the return)
Then run R.app and yes, I have one .Rhistory and one .Rdata in that folder

But then I change the working directory and do some stuff
Then quit and save working directory
And now I have two of each invisible files, one in R_History_Data and one in
the working directory folder

So it still appears as I move from directory to directory I will leave
invisible .Rhistory and .Rdata files all over

Is it possible to have Rhistory and Rdata always written to the
R_History_Data folder?

Message-ID: <28426D0A-C062-40E9-99B8-7C78E6DC969E@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm wondering if/where I can go to tell R to use a specific version of  
my gcc compiler when installing packages from source, via  
`install.packages("...", type='source')` or when running `R CMD  
INSTALL some_source_packge.tar.gz` from the command line.

The reason I ask is because I've downloaded gcc-4.4 from HPC/OSX[1],  
and it unfortunately puts the compilers in /usr/local/bin/gcc, w/o  
version info (it would be nice if it were /usr/local/bin/gcc-4.4). R  
tries to use this when compiling, but these compilers do not support  
the "-arch=..." flags, so it bombs.

I've been hunting around in the tools:::.install_packges code and also  
the "R Installation and Adminstration"[2] document, but can't find  
what I'm looking for. I have a feeling that perhaps I can put  
something into my ~/.R/Makevars, or ~/.R/Makevars-i386-apple- 
darwin8.11.1 file, but I'm just taking stabs at the dark, so not  
having much luck.

I can work around this by temporarily removing /usr/local/bin from my  
path when trying to `R CMD INSTALL` packages by source, but I was  
hoping there might be a more elegant solution. The fact that  
installing by source gets the `make` command from the system  
environment makes me a bit hopeful, but I'm not really sure.

Thanks for any help,

-steve

You can pass configure args with the configure.args parameter to 
install.packages.  I'm not sure how many you need to set, but you'll 
likely need to set CC, CPP, CXX, F77, FC, OBJC, and maybe some of the 
associated flags.  You can see the list using "R CMD config" in the console.

You will want to recompile R with the new compiler. Then, whenever you  
compile a package, it will use the same compiler as R was compiled with.

Mixing compilers might be possible using the hints from Duncan, but I  
am pretty sure it is discouraged.

In the past Simon has discouraged use of the HPC compilers. I don't  
remember the reasons, but I respect the source of the information :)  
He knows way more about mac compilers than I do. Of course, this was a  
while back and things might have changed.

Loren,

Can you send me a screen copy of the Startup preferences ( with the  
cursor inside the Startup Preferences window, press Command-Shift-4,  
followed by pressing the spacebar, followed by a click of the mouse  
button, this should write it to your Deskop as 'Picture 1').

Thanks Duncan & Kasper, I've been able to squeeze out of my problem ...

The R CMD config was the trick. I actually  put set those flags in my  
~/.R/Makevars-PLATFORM file, as it seems the build step is picking  
these up so I don't have to pass them into the configure.args param.  
For the record, since I'm on a first generation MBP, the name of that  
file is "Makevars-i386-apple-darwin8.11.1", and it looks like:

CC=/usr/bin/gcc
CPP=/usr/bin/cpp
CXX=/usr/bin/g++
CXXCPP=/usr/bin/cpp
OBJC=/usr/bin/gcc

Kasper:

Thanks for the preemptive warning. On the computer where I'm having  
this problem, R is actually installed from the official cran  
installer, so I just needed to set it to use the apple gcc by default.

I have to assume that this R was also built w/ Apple's gcc, so perhaps  
R doesn't use the same compiler by default, as you suggest? I'm not  
sure.

Yeah, I'd trust that source of information as well :-)

This kind of leads me into another related question, then. So, I  
actually d/l'd the HPC compiler so I can compile w/ -fopenmp (to use  
OpenMP for some easy parallelization). Does this mean that I shouldn't  
do that w/ a vanilla R install and perhaps recompile R from source w/  
the HPC compiler? And if Simon doesn't like using the HPC compiler,  
then should we stay away from this in general?

Thanks,

-steve

Loren,

Thanks for the screen shot.

A bit more experimentation and a quick look at the code refreshed my  
memory.

If you exit R, .RData is always written to the directory you are in.

In your setting, on q() to quit, R.app should ask for conformation to  
save the workspace.

If you don't change your directory it should create a .RData in your  
home directory (that's where your R.app started).

Preferences do not provide help here, but you could create a .Last  
function with a save.image() command in it to force storing the .RData  
file to a fixed directory. In that case you can opt to set the Quit  
preferences to 'No' (don't ask me to store the workspace).

For history its a (tiny) bit more flexible. By selecting an absolute  
path, like you have in your setting, it will always store the current  
available history commands in that file (including the ones that were  
read in during startup, so the new commands are at the end of the file).

If this does not work for you, can you send me your ~/.Rhistory file  
after executing a last new command in R.app, maybe something like  
'testHist <- 1' and quitting R.app?

As you found in the archives, a few folks did have trouble (usually  
because R.app could not write to the selected directory).

After this email it might be better to take this discussion off-line.

Regards,
Rob

Sorry to spam, but I just wanted to post this follow up just in case  
someone asks google about this later.

I found that I can get the R's default settings for the ones I needed  
to override (CC, CPP, etc.) by typing `R CMD config SETTING` at the  
command line. So, for instance, to find out what R had config'd for CPP:

$ R CMD config CPP
gcc -arch i386 -std=gnu99 -E

So I used that to redefine my Makevars, only now I have an absolute to  
gcc/g++ so that I can get the ones from Apple, and not the one in my / 
usr/local/bin. So, the contents of my  Makevars file is now:

CC=/usr/bin/gcc -arch i386 -std=gnu99
CPP=/usr/bin/gcc -arch i386 -std=gnu99 -E
CXX=/usr/bin/g++ -arch i386
CXXCPP=/usr/bin/g++ -arch i386 -E
OBJC=/usr/bin/gcc -arch i386 -std=gnu99

Ok, so Rdata goes to the directory one is working in; and so will have
Rdata's in many folders which seems strange

As for Rhistory if one declines to save workspace, Rhistory is written to
the directory specified; if one saves workspace Rhistory is written to both
the directory specified and the workspace directory, ie to both; this also
seems strange

And the troubled history is attached

This seems problematic; not knowing where these files are going and winding
up with many; and then the forgetful Rhistory as well

Thank you

Loren,

As a counter example, I work on 5 or 6 different projects  
simultaneously,
each in its own directory sub tree. Several of the projects need to  
store the
workspace after I'm done. This is implemented as the default mechanism.

Through the .Last mechanism you can get your desired behavior. But
unfortunately, it will take some extra work to define the .Last  
function.
That should take care of many .RData's.

Could it be R, not R.app that creates the .Rhistory file if the  
workspace is
saved????? I am not aware of this behavior (the fact that R creates a
history file when asked to save the workspace), or simply might have
missed it if it was introduced in the 4 or 5 years since I worked on the
history mechanism for R.app.

And indeed, in that case, if the name of the history file set in the  
R.app
preferences is the same as R's default name (.Rhistory) ***and*** the
workspace is saved, the history file seems to forget recent commands
because R.app writes its history file which is subsequently overwitten  
by R.

Maybe someone familiar with the R source can confirm this behavior, I  
have
rarely looked at the R source, just at the R.app code.

Currently, no. For history, yes, but not for .RData, because the  
assumption is that you want to save the workspace in the directory  
that you are in at the time (many users start R and then change the  
working directory to the project directory so this behavior is  
explicitly intended). This is also the behavior in R on the command  
line. Note that you are explicitly saving the workspace, so it's not  
as if R.app is saving things on its own randomly - you actually told  
it to do so.

We could add an option that allows you to force R.app to save the  
workspace in the same location that it was loaded from or started  
(which means that you would specify that location implicitly by the  
way you start R.app). I'm slightly hesitant to do that, because it's  
not something one is used to from R, but it could be done (but then  
the .Rhistory option is already non-standard ...).

Cheers,
Simon

R uses the Apple compiler, but I'm not hard-coding the full path. In  
your case apparently your PATH has /usr/local/bin before the system  
paths, so it overrides the default. Another (simpler?) way to solve  
this is to simply move /usr/local/bin at the end of your PATH  
(recommended) and all should be well without changing any config files.

You can use -fopenmp with Apple's compilers as well, just make sure  
you make the gcc-4.2 compilers the default (sudo gcc_select 4.2 if you  
have gcc_spect on your system, otherwise change the symlinks like ln - 
sf gcc-4.2 /usr/bin/gcc etc. - or specify them directly as you did).  
Apple's gcc-4.2 compilers are supported by the CRAN binary.

In general, yes. As you have seen yourself the HPC compilers are not  
complete, so they cannot build universal binaries. Also they don't use  
Apple's driver, so all Apple-specific flags will fail. I didn't check  
the last HPC release, but before they were partially broken causing  
miscompilations, included wrong binaries (i.e. even the compiler for  
Tiger would include symbols for Leopard so the binary would not work),  
etc. I was trying to contact the maintainer a few times, but without  
avail, so I don't think it's well supported, either.

Cheers,
Simon

No no, thank you for helping

To clarify, I am not out to "fix" or "change" anything, or report bugs, I
just want to understand how to efficiently use R.app, my problems are

1-on my systems (one 32 and one 64), Rhistory "forgets" commands which is
how this all started, and
2-I find the Startup Preferences confusing

Ok, Rdata: several explained that in the workspace, a new object "x" will
overwrite an old object "x" without warning, by keeping Rdata's separate one
can use "x" many times for different things, I have always manually saved
important Rdata's and ignored the default Rdata, but I can change, or do
both now that I understand

Now Directory in Preferences: I have checked Always apply and the directory
is ~; the notes say dd of directory will override if not enforced; but if I
dd a folder onto R, the working directory is not ~ but rather the one dd'd
onto R, so does not seem "Always apply" is working

Now Rhistory: again the problem is Rhistory forgets commands on my system,
which is why I got into this, but then I find Rhistory(s) all over

in Prefs I have checked Read on startup and the history file is ~/.Rhistory
(return saves that value, thank you again, this might be in the notes) and I
checked Cleanup history.

It appears that if I work in some directory and then quit w save, the
history is written to both ~/.Rhistory and the directory. So I had 33
.Rhistory(s) on the drive even tho I told R.app to use one.

So I tried your second idea, changed the R.app history name to .xxxRhistory
and voila, ".xxxRhistory" appears where R.app Preferences say and
".Rhistory" appears in the working directory, so would appear you are
correct; R.app is writing out .xxxRhistory and somebody else is writing
.Rhistory

Now if I work in the default directory AND have R.app set to write
.xxxRhistory AND quit/save, I again find in the directory both .xxxRhistory
and .Rhistory, so you are again correct; R.app writes .xxxRhistory and
somebody else writes .Rhistory

And the .Rhistory file is written about 4 sec after the .xxxRhistory file
and the .Rhistory file is 0kb

So then your third idea might be correct; ie if R.app writes .Rhistory it is
overwritten by the second writing of .Rhistory and if the second .Rhistory
is missing commands, then it would appear that R.app is forgetting commands

In sum
1-is it possible that .Rhistory from R overwrites .Rhistory from R.app and
the history that R uses is incomplete so commands are "forgotten"
2-and of course what is the work around for #2
3-and lesser, what does "Always apply" do for the directory

I actually wanted to avoid doing this because I tend to install newer  
versions of standard things into /usr/local/* that I'd like to use  
instead of the default ones in /usr/bin/* so I was looking for a back  
door ...

As for the rest of your comments (which I'll keep below for  
posterity), they're spot on. Thanks for the thorough and informative  
feedback. I've nuked all traces of the HPC compilers and will now just  
explicitly compile w/ /usr/bin/g++-4.2 when necessary ... that's a  
simple-enough sol'n for me until Apple decides to set some gcc >= 4.2  
as the default compiler.

Thanks again,
-steve

Thank you

Several explained that in the workspace creating object "x" will overwrite
previous object "x" with no warning and so serious users keep Rdata's
separate and use "x" over and over.

I usually manually save important Rdata's and ignore the default, but I can
change, or every so often simply find all the Rdata's and delete them, or
since drive space is cheap, simply ignore them (a "big" Rdata of mine is
only 400mb).

Loren,

I will look into the 'Always apply', your understanding is correct and  
it should not change the working directory on drag&drop of a file or a  
directory if 'Always apply' is selected (according to my own note :-).  
It seems to work fine for a file but not for a directory.

Simon, do you recall if there was a specific reason why we treated  
files and directories similar? What's the point of d&d-ing a directory  
on the R.app icon other than to set the working dir?

Loren, why do you d&d a dir on R.app?

A quick test with 'R-in-a-terminal' indeed does show R creates a  
history file after answering the q() question with yes. Not sure if  
that is R or maybe some initial default behavior. Of course, in a  
terminal the file actually contains history commands. I fully agree  
with Simon, deviating from R haunts you for many years (but at that  
time of making those changes I did not want to drop the old R.app  
multi-line history feature).

Rob

Well, that is the main point ;) - it sets the working directory so  
that all settings, workspace etc. is loaded from that directory.

Because it's the recommended way to start working in a specific  
project directory? At least around here this is the most common way to  
start R.app ...

I'll have to look into the .Rhistory business. We probably simply need  
to sync the history handling and chances are that the callback cleanup  
in 2.9 has brought up something. So far R.app essentially ignores R's  
history handling so they are wholly separate yet competing as it  
appears - I'll have a look.

Cheers,
S

Hi and thank you

Why d&d directory onto R.app?

Now that I understand the common use of many Rdata's, one in each working
folder, and Pref notes say "d&d of file or directory on R icon will
override", I was trying to get with common usage by starting up with d&d
onto R.app rather then double clicking R.app and then changing location; did
not try to d&d a file since the R files (Rhistory and Rdata) are invisible;
and then found that the "Always apply" directory is overridden; so then
confused about what does "Always apply" mean

This is part of my "prefs are confusing" problem but not part of the
"Rhistory commands being forgotten" problem; which is probably more
important

Today I said I would stop fiddling with Rhistory and do work, but I find if
I double click on the bottom entry in the history window, things go wrong.
Seems like returns are added and multiple commands are combined into one
entry in the file. Here is what the end of the history file looks like in
BBEdit

.Machine$sizeof.pointer
sessionInfo()
ls()
rm (ABeset_gcrmaNumhom)
ls()
AB_gcrmaNumhom <- gcrma(AA_ReadAffyNumhom, fast = FALSE)
library(gcrma)
.Machine$sizeof.pointer#

.Machine$sizeof.pointer#
#

.Machine$sizeof.pointer#

.Machine$sizeof.pointer#

Loren,

The double click issues will go away if you select the 2 entries  
under  the line 'Max number of entries ...' in the Startup pref.

As a history workaround, for now just make sure the Startup pref for  
the history file is not .Rhistory, as you tested before.

Seems like d&d does what you want, I might just change the note. I  
know some folks start R.app by d&d-ing an xxx.R file on it.

Hi

Double clicking bottom command: I want to keep dupes but double click
problem seems to go away if I just check "cleanup"; if "cleanup" is
necessary for proper behavior of bottom command, why have it optional?

Rhistory: I have R.app writing to .engravRhistory and Cleanup checked but
Remove dupes not checked. Quit still cuts a duplicate history entry at the
bottom; but so what? A duplicate at the bottom is unnecessary, but cutting
it is unexpected

D&D: seems confusing if d&d a file does one thing and d&d directory does
another; would seem that neither should override the setting since it says
"Always"

Anyway
With Cleanup checked
~/.engravRhistory locked in with the return
Understanding the common use of and location of .Rdata
Ignoring the little proliferating .Rhistory files

I may in fact be "good to go"

Thank you so much

And installing 64bit stuff is surely easier now

X11 is already installed on my system
X11 is launched before lauching the R command line, and this does not

We would appreciate any help.

Originally, during testing, the improper behavior occurred only  
occasionally, which led to that decision.

With 'remove duplicates' cleared, duplicates *at the bottom* are  
written to the history list/file but filtered out when the history  
file is loaded the next time R.app is started.

Setting 'remove duplicates' removes *all previous* duplicates in the  
history list as you go (to keep useful history as short as possible).

Agreed, it is perfectly ok to out of habit start R.app by d&d-ing a  
file or directory on the icon.

Looks like it. Thanks for your effort.

All thanks there (and the other 99.99%) goes to Simon. I agree, 64 bit  
works really well.

libglade is not an R package.  It comes with the Gtk+ dmg
that you can get from http://r.research.att.com/

There appears to be a problem with your Gtk+ installation.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] crash report for R2.9.0
Message-ID: <9AB320DD-EA28-47DC-96D4-5ADDD7B74E35@adelaide.edu.au>

I just downloaded and installed R2.9.0.  I can't seem to get it to  
run, crashes on start.  I think it has something to do with the recent  
10.5.7 os update. Any assistance would be appreciated.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Linux user asks: What about that Editor you have
	built-in. Can we compile it too?
Message-ID: <13e802630905151259v598d24fewd2be94ce21ef6545@mail.gmail.com>

I use Linux only and have been teaching students with Emacs & ESS.
Lately, we've had some troubles with that combination that are not
solved, and it has caused me to look about for alternatives.

One of my students has a Macintosh and he showed me that the R that he
installed came with an editor that does what we need. The
command-shift sends lines over.

So I started to wonder: why can't we compile that Editor in Linux?  If
a Mac is really BSD Unix with a layer of libraries, it should be
possible.  There are GNUstep libraries to duplicate much of the
NextStep framework, but I have not studied enough on current Mac
systems to know how close we might be to building the Mac R editor
along with R itself.

I've been Googling and searching in this lists archive and don't find
much discussion on this.  If anybody has ideas about whether this is
possible, please advise.

Paul,

Can you describe the problems that you are having with Emacs/ESS?

I have played around with the editor in R.app on OSX, but I find the  
Emacs/ESS combination to be superior. In fact, I build Emacs 23 from  
CVS to have a 'real' Emacs on OSX, as opposed to the quirky behavior  
of Aquamacs.

Regards,

Marc Schwartz

Paul,

Hopefully someone with knowledge of Emacs & ESS & R on Linux will help  
you first!

I would guess recompiling just the Editor is virtually impossible.  
R.app, in which the Editor is embedded, is Cocoa based. It would be a  
major undertaking to port R.app or at least major parts of it (and  
subsequent maintenance). E.g. http://www.gnu.org/software/gnustep/resources/BookClarifications.html 
  talks about some of the issues.
And there is a 3rd edition of the Hillegass book.

If the Emacs/ESS issues absolutely cannot be resolved, maybe a more  
feasible/easier route would be to use tcl/tk, like John Fox has done  
in Rcmdr. Maybe start-off with something like MetPad? Not simple  
either, but doable.

Rob

Hi,

I'm not sure either, but I don't think it'd be all that trivial to  
port over the editor if it's cocoa based.

If for some reason your emacs/ess issues don't get solved and you're  
looking for an editor/R combo, perhaps taking a look at Eclipse with  
the StatET[1] plugin might be a better option than trying to compile  
your own editor together :-)

I'd like to ask a tangental question.

I'm running Mac OS X 10.4.11 on a G5 PPC, and I also build Emacs from
source.

   GNU Emacs 22.3.1 (powerpc-apple-darwin8.11.0, Carbon Version 1.6.0) of 2009-03-28 on spud.local

I've recently started experimenting with ESS version 5.3.11, which I'm
using in conjunction with R 2.9.0.  About half of my time is spent in
R.app (console and/or built-in editor), and the other half is spent
with ESS.

One thing I miss with ESS is quartz.save().  From ESS, I can open a
quartz() device and plot to it, but quartz.save() gives the error
'could not find function "quartz.save"'.  Here's an example:

    # output starting from M-x R

dev.copy() works, though.

                   3

Is there a way to have quartz.save() work from within ESS?

The function quart.save() is defined in a file called GUI-tools.R  
which is part of R.app and not part of R itself. Thus, it would not be  
available by default outside of the OSX GUI.

You can see the file here:

   https://svn.r-project.org/R-packages/trunk/Mac-GUI/GUI-tools.R

However, trying it here, if you have R.app installed, you can use:

    source("/Applications/R.app/Contents/Resources/GUI-tools.R")

to make the function available outside of the GUI.

Running R from a regular Terminal:

 > source("/Applications/R.app/Contents/Resources/GUI-tools.R")
[R.app GUI  () i386-apple-darwin9.7.0]

 > plot(1:10)
 > quartz.save("plot.png")
quartz
      2

 > quartz.save("plot.pdf", type = "pdf")
quartz
      2


I tried it from Emacs/ESS and as expected, it works there as well.

The likely explanation is that the checking in 2.9.0 (sic) is more 
thorough, so it is problems with your package or platform that the 
earlier version (there was no 'R 2.7': please do study the posting 
guide) did not report.

You need to look at the .log file in the .Rcheck directory.

Marc,

That's a great piece of information -- it's exactly what I was looking
for.

Thanks much!

Dear R-Sig-Mac,

Regarding Ji-Ping's problem I experienced a similar issue after having
upgraded to 2.9.0 on my Mac. The checking of the PDF manual causes
warnings and the following check of PDF version without index causes an
error.

$ tail -n 4 00check.log
* checking PDF version of manual ... WARNING
LaTeX errors when creating PDF version.
This typically indicates Rd problems.
* checking PDF version of manual without index ... ERROR

The interesting part is that when uploading the <package>.tar.gz file to
Uwe Ligges win-builder website, the package compiles without warnings or
errors on Windows.

Furthermore, the document compiles without any errors when manually
compiling the resulting <package>-manual.pdf in the ..Rcheck folder with
pdflatex.

However, when trying to generate the manual with:

$ R CMD Rd2dvi --pdf .
Hmm ... looks like a package
Converting Rd files to LaTeX ...
  <snip>
Creating pdf output from LaTeX ...
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/bin/Rd2dvi: line 228:
/usr/texbin/pdflatex: No such file or directory
Error in running pdflatex command ('/usr/texbin/pdflatex')

It appears as if the new 2.9.0 searches for pdflatex in
/usr/texbin/pdflatex

however, my pdflatex is located in e.g.

$ which pdflatex
/usr/local/teTeX/bin/i386-apple-darwin-current/pdflatex

When setting up a symlink to /usr/texbin R CMD check worked fine. So the
problem appears to have to do with R looking for pdflatex in the "wrong"
place?

Best regards,

Michael



P.S. For the record:

$ which pdflatex
/usr/local/teTeX/bin/i386-apple-darwin-current/pdflatex

I use the nice java GUI "JGR" for both my own use and in teaching. See
http://jgr.markushelbig.org/JGR.html

Like R itself, JGR offers a single, free tool that works across all 3
platforms (but I have not used it with Linux).

I have extracted and attached the relevant pages from Bob Muenchen's
excellent 2009 Springer book, "R for SAS and SPSS Users," which I even
recommend--heartily--to statistical computing virgins. This book has lots of
down-to-earth information illustrated with good examples--including stuff I
have not found in other books in this niche. See

Michael,

CRAN R comes configured with MacTeX, see also
https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-mac/2009-April/006129.html

One of the problems is that PATH settings on OS X differ between LS- 
started apps, shells etc., so it is in general problematic to get the  
path right in all circumstances, so currently the CRAN binary assumes  
the most common distribution.

Cheers,
Simon

That would be quite an old TeX installation?
The teTeX distribution is no longer maintained.

You should consider switching to MacTeX ( http://www.tug.org/mactex/ )
It has everything you need. It's excellent.

True, but here we talking about R_PDFLATEXCMD, which is only used by 
Rd2dvi, which is AFAIK only called via R CMD and so from a shell. I 
would have thought that 'R_PDFLATEXCMD=pdflatex' (so looking on the 
path) was a better default for a binary distribution.

You can always set R_PDFLATEXCMD (or PDFLATEX) if the distributed 
binary is not right for you.

R CMD check does do a check for a workable pdflatex, but it seems it 
looks at the environment variable PDFLATEX not R_PDFLATEXCMD: I'll 
update it.

Hi, Berend and all,

   Thanks for pointing out this. That's very helpful. Indeed it was the path
of pdflatex issue. After installing MacTex, the problem is solved.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] R hangs when loading packages
Message-ID: <3E0A5043-7525-401B-9EB4-B339D4ED5216@gmail.com>

Hello,

I've recently installed R (version 2.9.0) on my Mac OS (Leopard). I'm  
using the Mac R.app application. Upon start up this works fine,  
however if I try to load several packages the application simply hangs  
(even after leaving it alone for an hour).

Strangely, some applications work fine, others don't. Some examples of  
failures are: R commander, relimp, tcltk. Ultimately, I'm trying to  
get FactoMineR to work with R commander, but when trying to install  
the FactoMineR GUI, which I believe depends on R commander, it also  
hangs. (Note: loading the package FactoMineR itself works fine!)

I've tried to load the packages via the Package Manager, and via the  
command library(rcmdr). I've also tried re-installing the packages,  
and re-installing R entirely. I keep having the same problem.

Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

Cheers,
Caroline

So, a couple things to check:

 From the force-quit monitor (cmd-option-escape), does your mac identify 
R as "not responding"?

Have you downloaded the packages so you can install from your local 
directory?

I think you should ask on the R-sig-Geo list: its arhives contain 
recent entries about building rgdal on Mac OS X. one of which I have 
used to give you a hint inline below.

That really doesn't help us: we need an exact record of what you did. 
But I don't see that --configure-args can be right, as you did not 
give a configure argument, which are like "--foo=bar".  For a real 
example see

https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-geo/2009-April/005544.html

which indicates how to specify paths for a framework.

You need 'type="source"' if you intend to build from the sources on a 
CRAN binary build of R: you really ought to have repos=NULL too.
Please do read the help page (we asked you to do so before posting in 
the posting guide).

Dear R-Mac-users,

a couple of weeks ago a message appeared in this list which mentioned  
a potential problem with R 2.9.0 and the recent 10.5.7 OS update.  
Since I would like to update my OSX, I was wondering if someone else  
had any problems.
Thanks,

Luca

That post was here:

   https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-mac/2009-May/006181.html

and there were no replies that I see. I don't know if Dave got an  
offlist reply or is still having the issue. I am copying Dave here to  
solicit his comments on any follow up activity he might be able to  
offer. The only thing that jumps out at me from his post is the  
Version indicated for R.app, which shows:

    R 2.9.0 GUI 1.28 Tiger build 32-bit (5395)

which may raise the issue of Tiger versus Leopard builds being used  
and that may or may not be relevant.

I am on 10.5.7 and although I build R from source, I have not had any  
problems since the OS update. I am running:

   R version 2.9.0 Patched (2009-05-25 r48609)

I can also run R.app, albeit I don't use it routinely:

   [R.app GUI 1.28 (5413) i386-apple-darwin9.7.0]

Message-ID: <5EF17F15-5D00-495F-B2F6-4194177A9E19@noaa.gov>

Howdy,

Using the scheme in plotmath, I can no longer get the degree symbol  
for my on-screen plots, using X11 on OS X. I instead see an upper-case  
upsilon (I think).  This is reproducible using "demo(plotmath)".   A  
figure drawn with this faulty symbol produces correct postscript (i.e.  
with a degree symbol) when I use dev.copy to write it to an eps file.

I'm using R version 2.8.1 Patched (2009-01-19 r47650) on an intel Mac,  
fully updated OS X 10.5.7.

Help appreciated,

Andy

Addendum:  This question was posed on the R-Help list, and Prof Ripley  
was kind enough to give me his thoughts on the problem.  His suggested  
work-around of X11(type="Xlib") does work.  I am re-posting my  
original question here at his suggestion.  Prof Ripley writes:

I think this error message is saying that it can't load the  
libgfortran.2.dylib library in:

/usr/local/lib/libgfortran.2.dylib

Do you have this file? If not, I believe this library should be  
installed by the full (not the mini) R installer (since it also  
installs gfortran by default), so if you don't have it, try to install  
gfortran from there.

Hope that helps,
-steve

I think there's a bit more to it than that.  If packages using 
gfortran needed /usr/local/lib/libgfortran.2.dylib, e.g. package stats 
would not work.  It is linked against

/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.9/Resources/lib/libgfortran.2.dylib 
(compatibility version 3.0.0, current version 3.0.0)

And the version of lme4 I downloaded from CRAN just now is the same. 
It is 0.999375-28, built 2008-04-17 (the latest is 0.999375-31, but 
lme4 fails its tests and so needs to be handled manually).  That's the 
'universal' binary package, picked up by the standard CRAN binary.

So, where did the lme4 package build come from?

The standard CRAN build is for 'tiger or leopard'.  It reports as

[R.app GUI 1.28 (5395) i386-apple-darwin8.11.1]

on the (console) command line and as quoted above in 'About R'.

Here is a follow up on my initial problem.

After rebooting my machine I have had no problems with R2.9.0 and here  
is the relevant information on my system taken from uname -a

Darwin Kernel Version 9.7.0: Tue Mar 31 22:52:17 PDT 2009;  
root:xnu-1228.12.14~1/RELEASE_I386 i386

So I am not sure what happened right after I upgraded R, but it seems  
to be fine now.

Cheers,

Dave

Something like

  system.file("scripts/ch01.R", package="nlme")

should work on any system.  You can use that for any file installed with 
a package if you know the path relative to the top of the package directory.

Take a look in

   /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.9/Resources/library

Also, you can use the .libPaths() function to see where R looks for  
installed packages.

Ah yes!

Thanks, Duncan; thanks Kjell.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] R.app takes a lot of time opening long script files
Message-ID: <8637BB18-420F-48A3-A481-DB182F9D4A0D@unive.it>

Dear all,

first of all I'd like to thank the developers for the very nice job on  
R.app.
I only have a, rather minor, problem:
when I double click on a source file with R code, R.app opens  
instantly but then it hangs for as much as a minute (and sometimes  
more, depending on the length of the file) until it finally opens the  
internal editor with the loaded code.
Actually this happens also if R.app is already running and also if I  
open the file using the "File" menu, instead of double clicking.
I've had this problem for a long time and with many R versions, so  
this is not specific of R 2.9.0 (I'm currently using binary CRAN  
version of both R and R.app). It's not even specific of my machine,  
since I have the same problem using three different computers.
Finally, note that the same source file opens immediately with any  
other text editor.

Thanks again,
Nicola
