Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] How to change default Browser for R
Message-ID: <CA+dpOJn6cm07OVvtAnah_JoxY5FdsGeBi0ZkxBmciuCnoQdA_Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

In my Mac, I have 2 browsers installed :

Chrome (system default)
Google Chrome Canary

While for my regular browsing work I use Chrome, However for R I prefer to
use Canary (like, opening Help page). Is there any way to set Canary only
for R, however keeping system default unchanged.

Thanks for your feedback.

Hi,

There are several steps involved during R ?Startup that set system and session specific ?options.

In your ~/.Rprofile, for session specific settings, you can add something like the following:

  options(browser = "/usr/bin/open -a '/Applications/Google Chrome.app'")

replacing the Chrome binary filename above with the Canary name.

Be sure to exit your R session after setting the above, then start a new session to pick up the change.

The above works for me, to change the default from Safari to Chrome, just within my R session, without affecting the system default.

Regards,

Marc Schwartz

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] CRAN OSX rgdal binaries 1.3-3 and 1.3-4
Message-ID: <alpine.LFD.2.21.1808051523090.7846@reclus.nhh.no>

The CRAN OSX rgdal binaries 1.3-3 and 1.3-4 do not include PROJ datum 
metadata files. To check whether your OSX binary rgdal has the PROJ 
datum metadata files, try:

library(rgdal)
projNAD()

If they are not present, consider running this snippet:

pkg <- "rgdal"
exdir <- file.path(system.file(package=pkg), "proj")
list.files(exdir)
tf <- tempfile()
fl <- "http://download.osgeo.org/proj/proj-datumgrid-1.7.zip"
download.file(fl, tf)
unzip(tf, exdir=exdir)
list.files(exdir)

Hope this helps,

Roger

I think a lot of us Mac useRs install the KyngChaos super-package (GDAL, GEOS, PROJ, SQLite and UnixImageIO framework described and linked to at:

https://www.kyngchaos.com/software/frameworks

I see that another version was released earlier this year which I had not installed, so I only had GDAL 2.1. I got this when loading `rgdal` version 1.3-1 (and I see that I'm a couple of minor versions behind. so I'll update) I did wonder that the message about linking to `sp` ver 1.2-7 didn't match my current version of `sp` which is 1.3-1

library(rgdal)
Loading required package: sp
rgdal: version: 1.3-1, (SVN revision 747)
 Geospatial Data Abstraction Library extensions to R successfully loaded
 Loaded GDAL runtime: GDAL 2.1.3, released 2017/20/01
 Path to GDAL shared files: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.5/Resources/library/rgdal/gdal
 GDAL binary built with GEOS: FALSE 
 Loaded PROJ.4 runtime: Rel. 4.9.3, 15 August 2016, [PJ_VERSION: 493]
 Path to PROJ.4 shared files: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.5/Resources/library/rgdal/proj
 Linking to sp version: 1.2-7 

# When I updated rgdal the startup message from rgdal now says:

Linking to sp version: 1.3-1 

# ... despite the fact that I installed 1.3-4

That's never cause a problem that I've noticed, but I'm not even a moderate user of GIS so am not stressing the interlocking programs very hard. 

I then mounted the newer super-package 2.2 disk image from KyngChaos and ran the pkg-installer to see if I could break anything. Nothing seems to be broken, but the rgdal package still reports loading GDAL 2.1.3, despite GDAL 2.2 being the more recent version and the one to which the 'Current' folder-symlink is pointing. The PROJ framework now has a new 4B directory but the startup message for the PROJ.4 runtime is also unchanged.

Thanks for reporting back. The line you refer to states the version of sp 
that rgdal links to, and sp_1.3-1 is the current CRAN version. Sometimes 
we forget to touch the header file in sp, so that it may be out of sync, 
but here it is OK. Possibly rgdal was updated before sp?

Because rgdal does not try to re-order the load list for 
shared/dynamically loaded objects, it takes the first one offered. If this 
(for GDAL) is not the same as the version used at install time, it should 
complain, but if install and runtime versions are the same, it shows the 
runtime version (getGDALVersionInfo() and getGDALCheckVersion()). 
getPROJ4VersionInfo() shows the PROJ version, using two sources, one a 
call to a runtime function, the other the PROJ header file version value 
from install time. These may differ, but the runtime simply reports the 
same header information, so this isn't foolproof (and versions of PROJ 
years ago were released without the header files getting the correct 
version numbers.

Provided the examples and tests run, things should be OK, but code 
coverage wrt. external software (and revisions of the EPSG database) is 
not like the textbook definition.

Hi all,

No luck exploring other avenues to find a solution - asking users (mostly students, computer novices) to install homebrew in order to install gtk+ isn't a viable option. 

Does anyone (Simon?) know if anything will be done on the CRAN side to compile and provide binaries for RGtk2 (and a handful of other packages)? 

Cheers,
Tom

The easiest way to compile RGtk2 is to use homebrew to install gtk+.

I tried to compile, received the same error as you, installed gtk+ and
compiled successfully.

Well... 

Assuming all your users are on the same platform (OS), why not compile
and distribute a zip of the binaries?
