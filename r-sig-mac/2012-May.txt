Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] png() segfaults inside a parallel::mclapply loop?
Message-ID: <CAHA9McNmXnRpPijg=fSAKmkzj4kX-UCajSR6Q7taseGYiS59cQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I can't figure this out -- I have to (slightly different) OSX boxes
running the same version of R that I grabbed from r.research.att.com a
little while ago:

R version 2.15.0 Patched (2012-04-18 r59079)
Platform: x86_64-apple-darwin9.8.0/x86_64 (64-bit)

Simply calling png() w/in a parallel loop always crashed the
subprocesses on one machine. This code, for example:

library(parallel)
mclapply(1:10, function(i) {
  png(paste("~/tmp/p", i, "png", sep="."))
  plot(1:10)
  dev.off()
}, mc.cores=8)

The error (from each subprocess) is pasted below, however swapping out
the png() call to pdf() works on both.

The machine that png() fails on is a ~ 2008 2x4-core mac pro. The one
that doesn't have a problem is a late 2010 core2duo macbook pro 13"

Both are running OSX.6.8

Anybody else have this problem?

Steve,

you can't use certain graphics devices/backends in forked processes (see multicore docs).  What is known to work is the Cairo package.

Cheers,
Simon

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Crash on pasting large amounts of text.
Message-ID: <C071F0B0-31E5-4DD1-AAE5-87862D6B9E37@mac.com>

Hi,

I'm getting a repeatable crash with R64:

R version 2.15.0 (2012-03-30)
Platform: x86_64-apple-darwin9.8.0/x86_64 (64-bit)
[R.app GUI 1.51 (6148) x86_64-apple-darwin9.8.0]

I have two (admittedly long) lines of values where I am creating two arrays. When I have them both in my clipboard and paste them into the console, things work without a problem. If I open a new text document in R and paste the lines, R crashes. The precision in the data is ridiculous, yes (they are output from another program as double precision), but the program probably shouldn't crash in any event. I don't know if a buffer is being exceeded or if it's another problem, but since it's trivially repeatable I thought I'd report it.

To reproduce, copy the entire text block below the divider at the bottom of this email, create a new text document, and paste.

Cheers,
Demitri

I agree that this should not crash R although your didn't really  
describe what that means. I did notice that an exclamation point was  
in there near the end, because my editor break long lines at "!" and  
that is not a valid numeric content as far as I know.

When I follow your suggestion I get an error message showing even more

It's the big "report this to Apple" crash. The whole app goes down.

These seem to have been introduced by the mailer - they don't exist in the original data. I wasn't sure if I could send an attachment, but I'll try that now.

Cheers,

Hi Tim

I encountered this recently.  If you do
  gcc --version
you'll notice that you get the llvm, whereas
  gcc-4.2 --version
gives you the "right"s standard GCC.  So essentially, when you
compile, you need to make sure you use
  gcc-4.2
and
  gfortran-4.2
both of which are in /usr/bin.  Note that gcc-4.2 and gcc are two
different beasts.  All of this can usually be done by doing something
like
  CC=/usr/bin/gcc-4.2 ./configure

Kasper

Output:
gcc --version
i686-apple-darwin11-llvm-gcc-4.2 (GCC) 4.2.1 (Based on Apple Inc.
build 5658) (LLVM build 2336.9.00)

gcc-4.2 --version
i686-apple-darwin11-gcc-4.2.1 (GCC) 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5666) (dot 3)

That is wrong - you should never see gcc from /usr/local - that is some entirely different compiler (unless you're experimenting with non-Apple compilers but then you may as well just compile Fortran ..).

As Kasper pointed out, you may need to use gfortran-4.2 or create a symlink from gfortran to gfortran-4.2 (and probably use gcc-4.2 although either should work).

Cheers,
Simon

I'm the only one who got that zipped file and I'm not planning on

The attachment arrived on the resent message from the r-sig-mac list for me. If you have any suggestions on how I can deliver this otherwise, I'm open.

I think you are misunderstanding what is a zip file ...

It's ok - some Windows people are scared of ZIP files because of the buggy tools that Windows uses to handle them can get tricked to spreading viruses. Fortunately, that is no concern for Mac user or anyone with some knowledge. ZIPs have somewhat inefficient compression - in your case you could simply gzip the file.

That said, I cannot reproduce your problem. I tried copy/paste from TextEdit, I tried copy/paste from the R editor, I tried <Cmd><Enter> from the R editor and I tried sourcing the file and all of those work just fine. Can you elaborate on exactly how you reproduce the crash and what OS X version you have?

Thanks,
Simon

So I'm now wondering if there are two components to my misunderstanding:

1) My experience with Windows is that zip files are sometimes delivery  
vehicles for executable files and htat the OS can be configure to auto- 
execute such files on decompression without further intervention. I  
worried that MacOS might have the same potential.

2) Am I also then misunderstanding what sorts of files the mailserver  
accepts and passes on to the list subscribers?

On Windows, yes, executables can be masqueraded as zip files with interesting consequences if the tools on the machine are broken enough (I wonder if this is really a relic from old times), but not on the Mac - zip files are as good as tar.gz or any other archive format. Also any half-way aware user (which may be the minority of Windows users, but hopefully not among R users) will unpack zip files directly, not by running them. Note that R uses zip files for packages, so it can't be evil :).

I'm not sure about the misunderstanding there - typically reasonable mail servers will scan content for viruses but otherwise pass any content through. Less reasonable mail servers may do pattern matching on file names and block some patterns (the net effect being frustrated users that can't get work done with no real security gain).

Cheers,
Simon

Here are the steps. I just updated my R installation yesterday as well, so I don't have anything beyond the standard packages installed.

- Open the data data file (e.g. BBEdit)
- Select all, copy
- Open R64
- Open a new file (command-N)
- Paste

The program will either crash or give me the SBOD with all of my CPUs running at 100% (the latter is new - it didn't happen yesterday). (I've seen programs do this, and I have never figured out what kind of coding error can lead to it!)

I'm on a Mac Pro, OS X 10.7.3.

I'm attaching the crash logs below. Let me know if I can provide any more information.

Cheers,
Demitri

Ah, ok, sorry, I misunderstood what you were doing - I thought you were pasting it to R.

The issue seems to be triggered by syntax highlighting - the GUI it trying to assign the proper colors to all the text you are pasting and something bombs there - I can reproduce it - we'll have a look, thanks.

Hi Demitri,

It seems that this is an issue of wrapping text in conjunction with line numbering.

Simon's response may have misled some folks:

Naive Windows users (redundant?)  don't understand either icon 
relationships or how to display full file names.  Those "bad" zip files 
are actually "sneakyname.zip.exe" .

AFAIK none of the more common unzipping utilities will launch an 
executable after unpacking the archive.  It may well be that some idiot 
(at Microsoft) set things up so that a new, say, .img file gets 
automounted sort of like what Windows does with an inserted audio CD. 
Otherwise, unpacking a true zip, or gzip, or tar.gz file will not lead 
to any autoexec.

I turned off the line numbers and still get the crash.

typically

http://.../R?x1=1&x2=20

run <- function(x1, x2, ...) {
  x <- seq(as.integer(x1), as.integer(x2))
  
In theory you could use

http://.../R?x=1:20

run <- function(x, ...) {
  x <- eval(parse(text=x))

but I would not recommend that since it would allow users to inject arbitrary code which is not good for the security ...

What do you mean? R scripts are to be run from R, not perl... You could simply run the Rcgi binary, but I'm not sure where you are heading with this ...

Well, you could get rid of the perl part to start with - FastRWeb automatically maps form entries into run() arguments so you should not need perl at all to process forms. If you still have some logic in perl that you don't want to push to R then your options may be thin -- you could run Rcgi from perl, use AJAX (from a page you generate with perl) or connect to Rserve directly, but I don't have an Rserve perl client, so you'd have to look elsewhere (maybe misappropriating the C++ client or something like that ... however, it should be fairly easy to write perl client for this purpose since you're only interested in strings)

Hello all,

I am in the process of installing the latest CRAN repository versions
of Rserve (0.6-8) and FastRWeb (1.0-1) on MacOS 10.6.8 machine. I have
installed Rserve and verified that it can start up just fine on its
own both by using the following commands in the R GUI:

library(Rserve)
Rserve(args="--no-save")

and by running "R CMD Rserve" from the command line. After doing
either of those methods I can telnet to my localhost port 6311 and
verify that Rserve is running. However, when I try to start Rserve
(after killing any existing processes) by using the FastRWeb
code/start script, I get the following error:

##> SOCK_ERROR: bind error #13(access denied)

When I go into R GUI and run this under debug mode I get the same end
result. Here is the session transcript from R:

# START SESSION TRANSCRIPT
> Rserve(TRUE, args="--RS-conf /var/FastRWeb/code/rserve.conf --vanilla --no-save")

--RS-conf /var/FastRWeb/code/rserve.conf --vanilla --no-save

Note: debug version of Rserve doesn't daemonize so your R session will
be blocked until you shut down Rserve.

That's entirely irrelevant since FastRWeb doesn't use TCP/IP - make sure you are running the correct Rserve settings which are *not* on port 6311. All you need to do it to use the start script.

You seem to have permission issues on the socket or the FastRWeb directory - check the permissions on
/var/FastRWeb/socket
You should make sure that _www has both read and write access. Remove it before starting if in doubt. If it's not there, make sure that the user under which you run Rserve has write permissions in /vat/FastRWeb. That applies to the other directories as well - it will need write permissions on tmp and _www must be able to read web.R and tmp.

Cheers,
Simon

Simon,

Thanks for the help. It was indeed a permissions issue. Thanks for
guiding me in the right direction. Also I will make sure to direct any
future questions to the mailing list you mentioned. Thanks!

Federico,

R.app doesn't crash (you would get a crash report), it simply waits for the install to finish. There is no output and R.app cannot react until the installation has finished. BioC server can have very slow downloads so particularly for larger packages it can take a long time to install.

Cheers,
Simon

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] .First for R.app called twice?
Message-ID: <CAAmySGPS9LhFAXu66JAsfFRP+QkR8qTcpQ3mw71pW=K4CJo4Fg@mail.gmail.com>

Suppose I have the following very simple ~/.Rprofile

.First <- function(){
    assign("e", exp(1), .GlobalEnv)
    lockBinding("e", .GlobalEnv)
}

If I start R from the terminal, all is fine, but if I use R.app this
throws an error about not being able to change the assigned value of a
locked binding on "e". This makes me think that R.app hits .First()
twice -- is that the intended behavior? [You can demonstrate this with
cat() statements more directly, but I figured I'd show a use case]

I don't have access to another computer right now to confirm, but the
difference between Terminal and R.app seems funny. If it seems to be a
problem with my machine, I'll hunt further.

Thanks,
Michael

It is somewhere between intention and a bug. It is caused by the necessity of the R.app GUI to deal with launches in a different working directory -- e.g. when you drag a folder on the GUI. Because the GUI has to setup R and start the event loop before it can accept open events it emulates the regular R behavior after receiving the open event by starting R with --no-restore-data first and then loading the workspace "by hand" and running .First(). This is all fine if you use your workspace to populate .First, but if you do that in .Renviron then .First gets called twice: first when R starts without a workspace and then by the GUI because it doesn't know that your .First does not come from the loaded workspace. 

Obviously, an easy work-around is to check with bindingIsLocked().

That said, I have added a very, very ugly hack to work around your case in the GUI.

Cheers,
Simon

Thanks for your note, Simon. I think that I understand, but I'll dig
around in the source just to make sure. I'm likely revealing my
ignorance here, but is there any reason one or the other loads
couldn't run as R --vanilla or with the interactive() flag turned off?
[My actual .Rprofile has the whole thing wrapped in
if(interactive()){} to avoid trouble in R CMD .... scenarios] This
might be a nonsense suggestion though -- I don't really use R other
than starting a fresh workspace each time so I've never really thought
through how that would be managed.

Hadn't thought of this -- I'll add it to my .Rprofile

Don't uglify the code base on my account, particularly when such an
easy fix is available and I use the Terminal so much more.

Thanks again,
Michael

No, since the GUI is interactive -- note that the GUI doesn't do anything to the R afterwards. If we did not support changing working directories on document open we could start R without any flags. Another possible "fix" would be to run R with --no-profile and source it by hand, but I already feel bad about the somewhat strange sequence and the user typically wants to run .Rprofile from the home directory and not the dropped one.

The only reason I called it a hack is that we need to store a copy of the first .First so we can compare it after the workspace is loaded. But at least this way .First is guaranteed to run once (unless you change .First in .First() in which case it will still run twice anyway ...) - so it may not be that bad ;).

Simon

Please wait for the CRAN version, it should be up today or tomorrow. Alternatively you can upgrade you system (we will be removing Leopard support soon anyway). My understanding is that the CRANextras binaries are now cross-compiled, so they don't always work on Leopard anymore.

Can anyone let me know if the advice to install libiconv is really 
correct, and if so, how to do that?  I'm on OS X 10.6.8.

Are you sure you have Xcode properly installed and some 3rd party stuff doesn't interfere? This is what you get on a "vanilla" OS X:

checking iconv.h usability... yes
checking iconv.h presence... yes

checking for iconv.h... yes
checking for iconv... in libiconv
checking whether iconv accepts "UTF-8", "latin1", "ASCII" and "UCS-*"... yes
checking for iconvlist... yes
checking for iconv... yes
checking for iconv declaration... 
         extern size_t iconv (iconv_t cd, char * *inbuf, size_t *inbytesleft, char * *outbuf, size_t *outbytesleft);

iconv is part of the OS, so unless you have macports/fink or alike messing with you it shoudl work out of the box ... Check your config.log - it should tell you what's hitting you ...

Cheers,
Simon

Thanks!  It looks like it was fink in /sw.  I didn't intentionally 
install that; I'll have to try to figure out what I installed that also 
gave me fink.  Hopefully my backups will give me some clues.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] iconv inserting a LF in output after 180 characters
Message-ID: <EC97C971-1F29-441E-9DDC-087E88E404D4@pueo-owl.ch>

Hi,

On a Linux box running Red Hat Linux and R 2.14.1 I call iconv with a character string specifying to = "LATIN1".  The resulting string contains a \xa0 after 180 characters.  This character is not present in the input string, and the same experiment performed on a Mac running R 2.12.2 results in the expected output, i.e., without the \xa0.  I can't imagine this is something that the iconv installed on the Linux box is doing -- I've made a mental note to check it tomorrow when I'm back in the office.  Anybody care to take a stab at an explantion?  180 doesn't would like a random number.

Regards,
Richard
