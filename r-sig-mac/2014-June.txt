Hi Adrian

 (Busy couple of days, so apologies for not replying to your off-list email.)

 What is the output from

 library(XML)
 libxmlVersion()

 On my OSX machine(s), I get the same as you got on Windows - i.e. failed to load HTTP resource.
 But I have installed newer versions of libxml2 on my machines.

  D.

Don't worry about it, thanks very much for replying.
I could only get the libxml version on R 3.0.3 (it crashes under R 3.1.0):

> libxmlVersion()
$major
[1] "2"

$minor
[1] "07"

$patch
[1] "03"


# under 3.1.0
> libxmlVersion()

 *** caught segfault ***
address 0x18, cause 'memory not mapped'

Traceback:
 1: .Call(if (runTime) "RS_XML_libxmlVersionRuntime" else
"RS_XML_libxmlVersion",     PACKAGE = "XML")
 2: libxmlVersion()

I hope this helps,
Adrian

Adrian,

are you sure you don't have the wrong binary installed? You are using Mavericks build of R so you must re-install the packages to use the Mavericks binaries. Using the proper binary it works just fine for me:

> library(XML)
> libxmlVersion()
$major
[1] "2"

$minor
[1] "09"

$patch
[1] "00"


Check the build info for the package:

> read.dcf(system.file("DESCRIPTION",package="XML"))[,"Built"]
                                                              Built 
"R 3.1.0; x86_64-apple-darwin13.1.0; 2014-04-24 15:04:22 UTC; unix" 

> R.version
               _                                          
platform       x86_64-apple-darwin13.1.0                  

Cheers,
Simon

Dear Simon,

Hmm... you're right!
I remember clearly that I've installed the XML package using R's
package installer. I've performed an remove.packages() followed by
another fresh install using (again) R's package installer... and it
works now.

Thanks very, very much (and apologies to have waisted your time),
Adrian

Use traceback() to find where this error occurred.  If it was in the K()
function, then the argument passed as q is probably not what you think
it was, it was likely the built-in function q() that causes R to quit.

In this case it worked, because q was 3.2.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Unable to install packages
Message-ID: <A2558EE5-7408-4112-8287-C24D78993AC4@doctors.net.uk>

Dear r-sig-mac,

Perhaps somebody can help?

I have been using R as a student for a number of years on OSX 10.8.5, and have recently installed R 3.1.0 Snow Leopard Build.

Whereas previously I could install packages as I required, recently whenever I try to I am met with an error message:

Error: file ?/var/folders/f1/20lrk8gn2j92wc4k002v1jrh0000gn/T//RtmppF3r3c/downloaded_packages/mvtnorm_0.9-99992.tgz? is not an OS X binary package
In addition: Warning messages:
1: In install.packages(c("gconcord"), lib = "/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/library/",  :
  installation of package ?gconcord? had non-zero exit status
2: In install.packages(c("gconcord"), lib = "/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/library/",  :
  installation of package ?gconcord? had non-zero exit status
3: 'tar' returned non-zero exit code 1 
tar: Unrecognized archive format
tar: Error exit delayed from previous errors.

For binaries. Source will not install either, and using the R interface rather than GUI is no better. I have re-downloaded and installed R to no avail.

Suggestions?

Thanks in advance,

Jody

How did you do that?

...."I  try"? How are you trying?

You could conceivably have downloaded the wrong mvtnorm package. They all seem to have the same file names. See:

http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mvtnorm/index.html

For installation of the SL binary mated to 3.1.0 you want:

http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/contrib/3.1/mvtnorm_0.9-99992.tgz


> Source will not install either,

 How did you attempt that? And what error message were offered? 

 What versions? Do you have the development packages from Apple installed? Seems like you might if you are familiar with installing from source, but you haven't mentioned any specifics that imply that you are aware of this need. 

And did you load/activate the Command Line Tools?

What will "avail" you will be more complete details.

Hi,

In /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions , I see the installed 
packages for all the R versions that I had:
2.13    2.14    2.15    3.0    3.1    Current
Is-it safe to remove all the previous instals and keep only 3.1 and the 
alias to Current ? I just put them in trash ?
Thanks

Marc

Yes. The Apple Installer keeps all files that are not part of the installation (here R) on upgrade. This is useful if you want to carry over the list of packages and is used by the GUI, so the only consequence is that you won't be able to filter package list by packages installed in older versions.

Cheers,
Simon

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] ncdf4 not auto-building on Mavericks -- can't tell why
Message-ID: <CAL+Zad9ZVo=Ugv2U2xxZ2PYorPTMaaGKkhej6CmHiuiKYxNs2A@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm the package maintainer for ncdf4, which provides an R interface
for netcdf files. I have successfully built and installed the package
on a OS X Mavericks machine I have access to, but the nightly build on
that platform for R failed with an error I'm trying to understand.

I'm sure it's documented somewhere who to contact about odd results on
the specific Mavericks machine used for the CRAN compiles, but I have
not been able to find that despite some searching. Does anyone know if
there's a contact who can be approached about the software environment
of that particular machine?

More technical details of the compiling problem follow.

The netcdf library has an accessory script that shows how it was
configured on the machine in question (the Mavericks machine in this
case). This shows:

------

This netCDF 4.1.3 has been built with the following features:

  --cc        -> gcc -arch i386 -std=gnu99
  --cflags    ->  -I/usr/local/include
  --libs      -> -L/usr/local/lib  -lnetcdf -lhdf5_hl -lhdf5 -lm -lz -lcurl

-----

which is stating that the library compiled correctly using
-L/usr/local/lib -lhdf4_hl (among other libs). Yet the R build failed
with:

clang -dynamiclib -Wl,-headerpad_max_install_names -undefined
dynamic_lookup -single_module -multiply_defined suppress
-L/usr/local/lib -o ncdf4.so ncdf.o ncdf2.o ncdf3.o src_ncdf4.o
-Wl,-rpath,/usr/local/lib -L/usr/local/lib -lnetcdf -lhdf5_hl -lhdf5
-lm -lz -lcurl -F/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/.. -framework R
-Wl,-framework -Wl,CoreFoundation
ld: library not found for -lhdf5_hl
clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)

which claims that -lhdf5_hl was not found. The odd part is, if that
library was found when the netcdf library was compiled, why wasn't it
found when the R ncdf4 package was compiled with the same -L library
path flag? Am I missing something here?

Also, I know essentially nothing about Macs (hopefully some people
here can help me on this), but I see that the netcdf library was
compiled with "-arch i386", while the R package was compiled with
"clang -Wall -mtune=core2 -g -O2", which does not specify -arch i386.
Is it possible that the linker is reporting "hdf5_hl" not found
because the existing library is a 32-bit library but it's looking for
a 64-bit library? On Windows, for example,this would give an error
along the lines of "library is 32 bit not 64 bit" but I don't know how
OS X would handle this.

Thanks for any info,

--Dave
