Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Mac  R Gui crashes at startup -- suggestions?
Message-ID: <p06240800c5830c642503@[192.168.1.108]>

MacBook Pro running  OS 10.5.6

Running R 2.8.1 patched (2008-12-31)  (although same problem with 
other installations).

Trying to run R.app Gui  R 2.8.1 GUI 1.27 Tiger build 32-bit (5313) 
but it crashes on loading every time.

Problem just started today, I have reinstalled R 2.8.1 several times, 
tried multiple versions of the GUI.  I continue to have it give a 
malloc error when it starts.

I can run  R 2.8.1 from the console in X11.  But after using the GUI, 
that is painful.

I have restarted multiple times, checked permissions, reinstalled R 
(multiple times), tried different GUIs.  Time Travelled back to 
yesterday to get what was working fine, all to no avail.

Suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks.

Bill

 From the crash report it looks like perhaps your history file has  
been corrupted. I'd delete it and try again

Byron,

Great advice, but where  is it?

(The crash started just after I copied far too much into the console window.)

It's probably a file called .Rhistory in your home directory.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] GTK+ libraries can't be found
Message-ID: <8D630EFC-41EC-444D-A8EC-7F97EC2EA485@mac.com>

Dear all,

Installing the dependencies of rattle (http://datamining.togaware.com/survivor/Install_Macintosh.html 
), I encountered a problem installing the RGtk2 library from source.   
It appears that the  GTK+ libraries can't be found by R (I had  
successfully installed the runtime libraries from  http://r.research.att.com/) 
.

I would much appreciate some guidance as to how to get R to look in  
the right place (/Library/Frameworks/) for the the GTK+ shared  
objects.  Many thanks in advance.

Kind regards,

Ivan

If you have your environment set correctly this is automatic. However,  
from your output it seems you don't so make sure you set something like:

export PATH=/Library/Frameworks/GTK+.framework/Resources/bin:$PATH

Also make sure you're not setting PKG_CONFIG_PATH anywhere (this is  
usually not the case, but it appears you have another pkg-config  
installed) and if you do (and want to use it), you must make sure the  
framework path to .pc is first.

Cheers,
Simon


(BTW: normally you should not need to install RGtk2 from sources since  
it's available on CRAN).

Dear Simon,

First of all many thanks for the guidance and more generally for the  
great stuff you do for the R Mac community.

On the environment, I have added the line you suggested to  
both .bash_profile and .profile, but R does not seem to be looking  
there (bash certainly does).  Where does the GUI R get the environment  
definitions from?  And more generally where can I look more closely to  
the startup process for R GUI as I have not yet managed to get it to  
read the ~/.Rprofile file (and the definitions therein) properly [I  
have tinkered with the preferences with no success]

On the availability of the binary for RGtk2 on CRAN and its mirrors, I  
am afraid that it does not appear in the ones I have tried (Munchen  
and the first US).  Should I be using another mirror that is more  
"complete"?

If I may, could I suggest an addition and one modification to the  
keyboard shortcuts for R GUI?  The addition would be to add "run  
function definition", possibly as shift-cmd-return, to take multiline  
commands in R, something usually done for more involved call (such as  
aggregate, merge, etc.).  Also, could the default cmd-return (or a  
variation of it) then move the cursor to the next command/uncommented  
line?  This would reduce the required keystrokes of my tipical  
sessions by half.  Many thanks in advance for considering this.

kind regards,

ivan

R GUI has nothing to do with the shell - that's a whole another story.  
I wasn't suggesting you set that PATH permanently at all - it is only  
meant for compiling things against GTK+ if you want to (it overrides  
some system commands, so it's not a good idea to do that permanently).  
Also I was referring to R CMD INSTALL or similar method (you didn't  
mention you are using the GUI at all). If you want to use the R.app  
GUI for this, clearly, you have to set it in R, e.g.:

Sys.setenv(PATH=paste("/Library/Frameworks/GTK+.framework/Resources/ 
bin",Sys.getenv("PATH"),sep=':'))


Now, this has nothing to do with your original question, but R.app is  
a Cocoa application so it is started by  launchd (via LaunchServices)  
- it is not started from the shell, so all .profile/.bash/etc. are  
irrelevant here. You can, however, set custom environment variables  
using Environment.plist (see Apple QA1067 - it was also discussed on  
this list several times as you'll see if you look at the archives).

I don't know what you are referring to, all US mirrors have RGtk2  
AFAICS and in fact they have rattle as well, see
http://cran.us.r-project.org/bin/macosx/universal/contrib/2.8/

You'll have to supply more details (at the very least sessionInfo() as  
we kindly ask you in the posting guide) if you want more help.

It is a good practice to not merge multiple entirely unrelated issues  
into one post. See archives for the discussion on <Cmd><Enter> and  
newline (feel free to comment) and for the former, please be more  
specific as of what it should do - "function definition" as a very  
vague term and if you want the GUI to find the function definition in  
the sources, then sure, contributed patches are highly welcome (in a  
separate thread, please).

Cheers,
Simon

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Package installation: setting default library
Message-ID: <49628A9E.4050108@witthoft.com>

Honest, I tried to find notes in the archives on this one.  Maybe I used 
the wrong keywords.

With sys 10.4.11, Intel iMac, I installed R 2.8.1 directly from the dmg 
installer package.

After that, I tried to install some R packages.  Due to port blocking at 
work, I have to download the files, unpack, and install from my local 
directory.

Using the R.app GUI, I selected "Install at System Level" and get an 
error message something like

" 'lib' variable not found, using default {my local Library/Frameworks 
directory}..."

The default value of libPaths was

[1] "/Users/carl/Library/R/2.8/library"
[2] "/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.8/Resources/library"

If I ran the command

R> .libPaths(.libPaths()[2])

{thus removing the reference to my local tree}

then the GUI properly installed to the system library tree.

So, is there a better, or simpler, way to make this happen?

thanks
Carl

What is 'somehat obscure' about (?install.packages)

See Also:

      'installed.packages', 'remove.packages'

      See 'download.file' for how to handle proxies and other options to
      monitor file transfers.

?  Indeed, where would you expect to find information about downloading 
files if not under download.file?

Far too often I think we get no credit for implementing such arcane 
things, nor for documenting them.

You are using the Leopard build of R - that one uses
http://cran.us.r-project.org/bin/macosx/leopard/contrib/2.8/
instead (which has fewer package than the Tiger build since only those  
supporting 64-bit are represented). See also R for Mac FAQ.

http://cran.us.r-project.org/bin/macosx/universal/contrib/2.8/
is for the CRAN (default) Tiger build.

Cheers,
Simon

Can you be, please, more precise? "something like" doesn't really  
help ...

Message-ID: <734B594F-1EDD-42BE-A659-B29C8D3D4D11@mac.com>

Dear Simon, dear all,

Back in March 2008 a thread evolved with the pros and cons of having   
<Cmd><Enter> "single stepping" through the code, much like it is the  
case in TINN-R, or ESS, or Eclipse with the StatET add-on. In fact, in  
the latter there are a number of options for submitting commands to R,  
which are listed here: http://help.walware.de/eclipse-3.4/topic/de.walware.statet.r.doc/reference/r_editor-codesubmit.xhtml

At the time Simon left open the possibility of enhancing the  
functionality of the R GUI editor in this direction.  For what it is  
worth, I would like to cast my vote for moving in the direction of  
such enhancements.

Best regards,

Ivan

Dear Simon,

Many thanks for clarifying the confusion.  Reading the MAC OS FAQ I  
understand that I can _in principle_ use the Tiger binaries with the  
leopard build. Is there a way to configure the default package type of  
the leopard build from mac.binary.leopard to mac.binary so that it  
looks in the universal folder?

Kind regards,

Ivan

You can simply set options(pkgType="mac.binary"). You can do that in  
your startup files if you desire. However, it could be (I'd have to  
check the sources) that the GUI still overrides this setting so you  
may want to use install.packages yourself. Again, I do NOT recommend  
this, since it defeats the purpose of the Leopard build (you won't  
have 64-bit binaries!), but you're free to do what you please ;).

Cheers,
Simon

I am wondering if Ivan has yet tried building the missing packages  
from sources using the R-GUI Package Installer. I was holding off on  
using the 64-bit GUI until I discovered how wonderfully simple you had  
designed that process. Sometimes the dependencies are not properly  
listed in the packages, but the error messages are clear (and  
highlighted in red) and installing the missing packages often solves  
the problems. I am assuming the the reasons for some of the binaries  
not automatically being created is the missing dependency information,  
since they usually compile without error when that is corrected.

A thousand thanks, Simon.

Dear all,

The latest leopard snapshot of R 2.8.1 seems to have a problem loading  
the tcltk package, and found no related entries in  
gmane.gmane.comp.lang.r.mac.  It appears to be a broken link. Any  
suggestions on how to fix it? Many thanks in advance.

Best regards,
Ivan

As the messages says you are apparently missing Tcl/Tk. If you had  
installed CRAN R, it would be installed automatically. Since you  
didn't, you have to install it separately from
http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools/

Cheers,
Simon

Because it does not play well with R.app.  Also, it is only version 8.4.7 
on my Mac (10.5.6) which is quite old and rather buggy, and Simon's build 
is 8.5.5 (I think).  8.4.x and 8.5.x are incompatible at binary level.

If you only use command-line R, the ActiveTcl version of Tcl/Tk version 
8.5.x works pretty well.

Ok, here is the response I get after R freshly booted via icon:


Rgames: .libPaths()
[1] "/Users/carl/Library/R/2.8/library"
[2] "/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.8/Resources/library"

-----
then I selected Install local package directory, with System framework 
as target location
  ---

Warning in install.packages("/Users/carl/Downloads/gtools", , NULL, type 
= "source") :
   argument 'lib' is missing: using '/Users/carl/Library/R/2.8/library'
WARNING: ignoring environment value of R_HOME
* Installing *binary* package 'gtools' ...
* DONE (gtools)
Rgames:

So, it sort of looks like the PackageInstaller GUI window isn't filling 
in the right library path when I click the Install At System Level  button.

Or, is there some way to get .libPaths to list the paths in a different 
order or something like that?

Yes, thanks, that's what it looks like. In fact all three of the last  
choices do the same thing which is incorrect in several ways. This is  
a historical relic from times where we didn't have native  
file.choose(). At any rate I think I have fixed that in the SVN, so  
please try the tonight's build tomorrow.

Thanks,
Simon

Message-ID: <8d0d8396-62e8-4fbf-84b5-c6909cdb449c@g3g2000pre.googlegroups.com>

Hi All & Happy new year !

On 10.5.6, R version R 2.8.1, I'm trying to change the family font in
quartz device using the "family" option.

I found this old mail and I encoutered the same problem...

Any idea ?

Thanks in advance, Charles

You could try using family= on the plot commands, or (base graphics)
par(family="Courier") or gpar(fontfamily="Courier") in grid/lattice.
Those work for me.

Looks (from the code) like the default family is unimplemented.

(A different device from 2.6.2, and I recall an answer at the time.)

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] problems with the data editor
Message-ID: <007101c9728d$78c0b460$6a421d20$@ca>

Dear list members,

I thought that I recalled a recent posting reporting a problem with the R
data editor, but I haven't been able to locate the message in the list
archive.

In any event, I can reliably cause the R.app data editor either to hang or
to produce errors in a couple of ways, the first of which is easier to
describe (the X11 data editor seems more robust, if limited in its
capabilities):

(1) Edit an empty data frame (which works in the Windows and X11 data
editors): edit(as.data.frame(NULL)).

(2) Edit any data frame "vigorously," adding a deleting rows and columns
repeatedly. E.g., library(car); edit(Prestige).

I'm using R 2.8.1 installed from the binary on CRAN under OS X 10.5.5 on a
MacBook.

I wonder whether anyone else has observed these problems or has an idea
about how to fix them.

(I'm copying Brian Ripley since we exchanged emails about this issue earlier
today.)

Regards,
 John

Can you, please, send me the crash reports you have? I can reproduce  
some of it, but I wonder if it's caused by the same problems as your  
crashes.

The data editor is horribly old code (or rather horrible, old code)  
that desperately needs re-writing. The plan was originally to do that  
for GUI 2.0, but it is not in sight due to the lack of manpower. I can  
at least see if I can fortify it a bit better so it doesn't generate a  
crash (I was hoping I won't have to do that since it's really an ugly  
mess). FYI the nightly builds won't run the next three nights, because  
we are having a complete shutdown here for maintenance until Monday,  
so the R.app binaries won't be fixed until Tuesday.

Thanks,
Simon

John,

I have fixed the empty dataset issue and few other borderline cases,  
so please try the updated R.app GUI (either from SVN or wait until  
it's available again).

However, there are apparently still some issues in the UI that I was  
not able track down since they occur only sparsely and randomly all  
over the place in internals of the Cocoa event handling when deleting  
multiple columns at once. They don't crash in our R.app code, so it's  
extremely difficult to trace. All I can say is don't delete multiple  
columns at once after busy adding/deleting ;). We really need a  
rewrite here ...

Thanks,
Simon

The crash produced by editing an empty data frame is simply for R to hang --
spinning ball, with an error message: SET_VECTOR_ELT() can only be applied
to a 'list', not a 'NULL'. I have to force-quit from R.

Simply editing a data frame "vigorously" has produced different errors,
including hangs, but what happens seems to be variable. I just was able to
generate the following:

*** caught bus error ***
address 0x6eb, cause 'non-existent physical address'

Traceback:
 1: edit.data.frame(Prestige)
 2: edit(Prestige)

Possible actions:
1: abort (with core dump, if enabled)
2: normal R exit
3: exit R without saving workspace
4: exit R saving workspace

I'm sorry to make work for you. I think that it's probably better not to
have a data editor than to have one that fails frequently. I don't use the
data editor much myself, but new users in particular are put off by the
instability, I believe.

This is curious, since I've just confirmed that the message in my out-going
mailbox had Brian as a CC. Oh well.

I'm not sure why your macports install is failing, but maybe we can  
avoid that for now :-)

Are your tcltk issues the same as what was spoken about here?

https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-mac/2009-January/005727.html

I believe the full CRAN R installer should have installed the tcltk  
libraries for you. Perhaps you customized the install and opted out of  
installing it?

You should be able to check and see if tcltk is installed by going here:

/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/library

and looking for tcltk/i386/tcltk.so

Hope that helps,
-steve

Go to http://r.research.att.com/  and install the RGtk+ at the bottom  
of the page there.  It may then ask you to install GTK+ also.  But  
after ding that, I was able to get it to work.

How? If you had used CRAN binaries all would be working.

Install R 2.8.1 from CRAN (full image, this includes Tcl/Tk), GTK+  
from http://R.urbanek.info/ (*) and you should be fine.

(*) - http://R.research.att.com/ is the canonical source, but this  
weekend it is down due to building maintenance, so please use http://R.urbanek.info 
  as a backup until the main site is up on Monday.

If you want to use MacPorts then you're entirely on your own and  
you'll have to compile R and all packages yourself (or get them via  
MacPorts). Experience has shown that cannot mix-and-match MacPorts and  
native builds, mostly because MacPorts are incomplete.

I followed those instructions, foolishly thinking that the new build  
might allow rattle to install with the 64 bit version of R when it had  
formerly failed to compile in the 64 bit environment. I can now launch  
the 32 bit version with the GUI app that had previously been installed  
with the ATT/Urbanek R 2.8.0, but perhaps not surprisingly, when I try  
to launch the 64 bit GUI, I get a system message "the application  
R_2.8_64bit" quit unexpectedly".

I realize that the name of the application is what I assigned it to  
keep it distinct.  I also realize that I will probably need to  
reinstall your experimental 64 bit binary when your website emerges  
from maintenance, Monday? But for the future is there is a preferred  
way to segregate the CRAN versions from your 64 bit versions? Is it as  
"simple" as the process described in earlier postings about running  
different versions of R? (The descriptions didn't seem that simple,  
but I am usually capable of following explicit directions.)

Hmm. Clearly, any other day I would urge you to update to the latest  
version ;) - but R 2.8.0 was known to work with the GUI. Can you,  
please, send me the crash log?

Ideally you don't have to, because the 32-bit part is sort of  
identical to the CRAN R (*), so on Leopard it doesn't really matter  
which version you are running. You can cannot segregate them easily,  
because identical paths are embedded in both binaries, so it's rather  
messy (and you'd have to modify every download package as well). I  
didn't think it would be useful given the equality, but it could be  
done (e.g. I could give the Leopard version a different installed name).

Cheers,
Simon

(*) - technically the only difference is that one is compiled on Tiger  
and the other on Leopard. They use the same set of tools and  
libraries. However, there is the slight difference in repository  
packages location - see the R for Mac FAQ, but you can override that  
if you wish. (This should *not* be considered an official  
recommendation ;))

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] ld: multiple definitions of symbol
Message-ID: <db80b30d0901120459q55a89065pe1de8597277b92d@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I am trying to compile multiple .c functions into
a shared object using R CMD SHLIB (I am using Tiger 10.4.10).
These functions make use of header files, some of with are in
the same directory as the .c files and some of them are standard I guess,
like #include <stdlib.h>.
When I compile the files using gcc, they compile beautifully. But using the
following command

R CMD SHLIB -o test.so *.c

I obtain errors of the sort:

ld: multiple definitions of symbol _ivector
nrutil.o definition of _ivector in section (__TEXT,__text)
tools.o definition of _ivector in section (__TEXT,__text)

I read somewhere that this is due to multiple compilers but I am not
sure about that.
I thought that I might have to add a statement for ld which says
--allow-multiple-definitions
but don't know where to put that in the R CMD SHLIB command. Or do I
have to include
the path to the standard libraries stdlib.h?

Thanks for any comments.
Hadassa

No, this is a bug in your code - it's because you have multiple  
definitions of the same symbol (ivector). If you want the two symbols  
to be the same across modules, you must declare it external in one of  
the two files. If you want them separate, declare both static.
(One of the most common mistakes leading to this error is to use  
definitions in header files).

Cheers,
S

It might be worth pointing out that this is an area where C compilers differ. Many compilers permit multiple definitions: if they are the same, the behaviour is as if all but one are extern and if they are not the same the behaviour is undefined or implementation-defined.  I have read (I don't know if it's true) that this handling of multiple definitions was actually necessary for the early C++ compilers that compiled to C.

There's some discussion in the Rationale to the C standard
   http://www.lysator.liu.se/c/rat/c1.html#3-1-2-2

Anyway, Simon is right that the Apple gcc demands that there is an extern on all but one declaration, and the Standard allows the compiler to demand this, and a program written this way will work correctly on compilers that have different views, so it's a good way to write.

Dear List

MacOSX 10.5.5
R-2.8.1 / R-2.9.0

I'm having difficulty  with vignettes under  Mac OS X.

Take the partitions package as an example.  According to the CRAN
package check page for partitions, this is clean under each
system, except for r-release-macosx-ix86 
<http://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_flavors.html#r-release-macosx-ix86>  
where the  check gives
errors, for example:

"Running 'texi2dvi' on setpartitions.tex failed. "

Similar things happen to my other packages that include vignettes;
I can't build vignette packages under macosx either.

What's going on here?

Dear List memnber,

first, I have to admit that I am not a Mac user nor am I subscribed to
the list, hence please cc my email adress in your responses directly.

The package urca now contains in /src FOTRAN code. The compilation works
on R-Forge (see project AICTSI with Leopard), but an error is reported
in the build on CRAN (Tiger). My question now is: Is there anything I
can do such that the package can be build under Tiger. Any hints and
pointers are welcome.

The code is available here:
http://r-forge.r-project.org/plugins/scmsvn/viewcvs.php/pkg/src/?root=ur
ca

And the Mac build log file can be accessed here:

Maybe _you_ could tell _us_?  R-devel gives more informative 
diagnostics than the above. However, 'partitions' checks out for me on 
my Mac, so I've no idea what you are seeing.  Surely a copy of your 
logs is 'at a minimum' information.

BTW, there is no 'R-2.9.0'.  If you mean 'R-devel (r47575)' or similar 
please say so -- too much time has been wasted in the past dealing 
with people using weeks-old versions of R-devel with issues that were 
only present for a few hours.

But the R-devel log will be the informative one.

... just telling us exactly which packages you have in mind would be  
perfectly sufficient and more informative ;).

Short story: nothing to worry about - it should go away

Long story: We do build packages incrementally, i.e. a package is only  
re-built if there is a new version (of the package or major R release)  
or the package has failed make check previously (along the concept of  
hope springs eternal). In the case of "partitions" it has last been  
built 11/13/08 which was before some updates to the TeX system on the  
check machine, so chances are that it wasn't happy with the TeX  
present then. I have re-checked the package (partitions) today and the  
NOTE went away. I'll check and see if any other packages are also  
affected and re-check them, too.

Thanks,
Simon

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Problem installing 64-bit R on Mac OS
Message-ID: <DE2768EF-3357-404C-A04F-1EA0508715B6@utsa.edu>

Dear List,
Please forgive the basic nature of this question.  I have looked for  
help on the list but have not been able to solve my problem.

I am trying to install the 64-bit version of R 2.8.1 on my machine, it  
is an iMac with the following configuration
Model Name:	iMac
   Model Identifier:	iMac8,1
   Processor Name:	Intel Core 2 Duo
   Processor Speed:	2.66 GHz
   Number Of Processors:	1
   Total Number Of Cores:	2
   L2 Cache:	6 MB
   Memory:	4 GB
   Bus Speed:	1.07 GHz
   Boot ROM Version:	IM81.00C1.B00
   SMC Version:	1.29f1

I am using the instructions on how to install the 64 bit build from:
http://www.matthewckeller.com/html/64_bit_r_on_mac.html
I installed the R-2.8.1.dmg file from CRAN, then downloaded the 64 bit  
nightly build for Leopard from
http://r.research.att.com
I then replaced the R.Framework folder on my machine with the one  
generated from the nightly build.

However, when I try to run the 64 bit version from the terminal using:
R --arch=x86_64
I get
/usr/bin/R: line 206: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/etc/ 
x86_64/ldpaths: No such file or directory

Any ideas would be most appreciated.
Corey

As noted on this list several times - please don't follow those  
instructions, unfortunately they are not quite correct. The canonical  
source of information is CRAN and the R for Mac Developers' Page (the  
latter has correct instructions). If you have questions beyond that,  
please ask on this list first. Follow 3rd party instructions at your  
own peril.

You were in the wrong place at the wrong time ;). The network setup  
was changed on Monday and the nightly build didn't run 64-bit builds  
because of that. I have fixed the issue and re-started the build, so  
the full builds should be available shortly (you'll see that its safe  
if the "Date" fields of Leopard builds shows this afternoon or later  
(e.g. Jan 13 16:00 or later)). Thanks for reporting this.

Just to repeat the instructions - please use
curl -s http://r.research.att.com/R-2.8-branch-leopard- 
universal.tar.gz | sudo tar fvxz - -C /
and then pick the desired R GUIs from
http://r.research.att.com/

Cheers,
Simon

Simon,

Thank you very much, I subsequently found your "how-to" site
http://r.research.att.com/building.html
and was able to build my 64-bit version quite easily.
Thanks again,

The package is ok.
We usually build against R 2.8.0 for compatibility but certain  
packages using FORTRAN code need to be built against R 2.8.1 because  
only 2.8.1 contains a fix for the error you report. I have re-build  
your package with R 2.8.1 and all is well.

Cheers,

"Selection:" is asking you to type an integer between 1 and 4 and hit  
return.

Looks like you overflowed a buffer, and the system threw an error at  
R. I held down the print button with the mouse and then moved the  
mouse off the button. The Print dialog box then said I had queued up  
1443 pages and the spinning rainbow icon persisted. Is that what you  
mean by" crash"? My guess is that a print buffer got too full.

If you went into your doctor and said "It hurts when I poke a pencil  
in my leg", it might prompt a reply, "Don't do that".

FWIW the crash is deep in Apple's print dialog code (and it's funny to  
see that it's all legacy Carbon), so I would be inclined to send this  
to Apple as it's more likely their bug ... [although you seem to have  
a rather funky setup judging by those snmpget timeouts ...].  
Nonetheless, thanks for reporting.

Hi,
I ran into this issue previously and managed to solve it, but I've
forgotten how and am getting frustrated...

I have a data frame (see below) with scandinavian characters in R
(2.7.1) running on a Win Xp-computer. I save the data frame in an
RData-file on a usb stick, and load() it in R (2.8.0) running on OS X
10.5. Now the name of the data frame and all factor labels with
scandinavian characters are scrambled. How do I make R in OS X read my
data frame?
>From what I've managed to find in the list archives and the FAQ I either
1) run
 Sys.setlocale("LC_ALL","en_US.UTF-8") ### Doesn't change anything
or
2) run
  defaults write org.R-project.R force.LANG en_US.UTF-8
in the terminal, which doesn't help either.
I must admit that I couldn't quite follow what documentation i found
on locales, so I might have messed up somewhere along the line.

Many thanks in advance for your help!

It displays sensibly (at least I think so, not being a reader of any  
Scandinavian language)  on my Mac (10.5.6).

You need to use CP1252 not UTF-8 to read the data.  It tells you how 
to do so on the help page ... under 'encoding'. So something like

   A <- read.table(con <- file("myfile", encoding="CP1252"));close(con)

Please don't cross-post ... I am being brief because you did.

I think that is because your email client re-encoded it (as did mine), 
always a hazard of email.  It was marked as iso-8859-1.  Email, unlike 
text files, can have the encoding marked.

Not just impolite, inconsiderate of the time and resources of others: 
you are asked not to do so on the mailing lists top page.

Reading the help page for Sys.get/set/locale:

"Attempts to change the character set (by Sys.setlocale("LC_TYPE", ),  
if that implies a different character set) during a session may not  
work and are likely to lead to some confusion.
Value
A character string of length one describing the locale in use (after  
setting for Sys.setlocale), or an empty character string if the  
current locale settings are invalid or NULL if locale information is  
unavailable.
For category = "LC_ALL" the details of the string are system-specific:  
it might be a single locale name or a set of locale names separated by  
"/"(Solaris, Mac OS X) or ";" (Windows, Linux). For portability, it is  
best to query categories individually: it is not necessarily the case  
that the result of foo <- Sys.getlocale() can be used in  
Sys.setlocale("LC_ALL", locale = foo).'

I interpret that as saying that if you use "LC_ALL", then you need to  
pass a character string to Sys.setlocale() that is constructed  
properly for a Mac and that it might have "/"'s. And you need to do it  
at the beginning of a session. And that it will be ignored, as you say  
"not do anything" if not precisely correct. This is what Sys.getlocale  
returns on mine:

"en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/C/C/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8"



Hope this helps;

Thank you for your help, and I apologise for crossposting previously.
I've previously figured out how to solve this issue when using read.table(),
but in this case I was using save() and load() on the dataframe,
inbedding it in a workspave- is there a way to tell  load() that the
workspace to be loaded was created with a specific encoding?

Regards,

Gustaf

Realizing that it might not work in all situations, would it give  
(possibly) useful results to assign the incorrect encoding found in  
Gustaf's email, which nonetheless was interpreted sensibly,  
"iso-8859-1", to the encoding string?

Actually, it says the opposite: the output you get is not necessarily 
valid input.

However, to set it, just en_US works (Mac locales are by default in 
UTF-8).  In Swedish, you can have:

tystie% locale -a | grep SE
sv_SE
sv_SE.ISO8859-1
sv_SE.ISO8859-15
sv_SE.UTF-8

and setting one of the middle two would have worked.

Annoyingly, Mac OS does not tell you which is which in the locales 
settings list, so it is basically useless.  I believe they are 
alphabetic (in the C locale) order since the Mac only has 6 
categories.

Yes: CP1252 is a superset of ISO-8859-1.  I knew because only one 
encoding can be used for Swedish on Windows (unlike most other OSes 
where there are three -- see my second posting).

Hi,

On my system (see below), it works fine (inputing the code below at  
the R prompt).  Make sure that the encoding of the input file is  
encoded UTF-8.

Dear Francesca,

As you probably noticed, your message is very difficult to read, but it
looks as if you haven't installed the X11 version of Tk. As well, you should
install the Rcmdr package with all dependencies, if you haven't already done
so, either through the package manager or via install.packages("Rcmdr",
dependencies=TRUE).

Instructions for installing the Rcmdr package under Mac OS X are at
<http://socserv.mcmaster.ca/jfox/Misc/Rcmdr/installation-notes.html>.

I hope this helps,
 John

John, it appears she doesn't have Apple's X11 installed (X11 is not  
installed by default on Tiger).

Francesca, please install X11 from the Tiger DVD (see R for Mac FAQ  
2.1.4 for instructions).

Cheers,
S

Dear Simon,

Thanks for fielding this question. Instructions for installing X11 under
Tiger are part of the Rcmdr installation notes for Mac OS. (Actually, I'd be
grateful if you could take a quick look at those instructions and suggest
and corrections or updates that might occur to you.)

Best,
 John

is there any way to define, how large the quartz plot-window should be  
with a command? (in pixel or inch)



Thanks!

hi,

is there a command for exporting the current plot as a pdf-file?

I tried dev.copy(pdf) but it generated a pdf-file I couldn't open  
("broken").


Thanks for any help!

I don't. Generally I use the File/Save method.

quartz
      2

I also get the same effect with Jeff Ryan's suggestion:
dev.copy2pdf(file="my.pdf")

You are asked in the posting guide to produce the full error message  
and your sysInfo(), and would suggest adding what you get from  
capabilities()

I don't believe that - I bet you have a typo there ... Why don't you  
copy/paste the command and the error? You were really sparse with the  
information you provided which is not necessarily helping us to help  
you ...

Mac GUI 1.23 is R 2.6.2 which uses "old" Carbon Quartz, so should  
consider updating R.

Ferdinand,

Another way is through saving it as a pdf file when you select the  
quartz window for printing.

This is using
   R version 2.9.0 Under development (unstable) (2009-01-12 r47571)
but it also happens under a somewhat recent version of R-2.8.1 (from  
svn)

I have compiled myself under OS 10.5 X (see below for compilation  
command), which is probably the cause of the following.

When I open a fresh R in the Terminal and do a simple
   > plot(1:10)
the "new" R quartz window pops up. When I then select the window using  
the mouse and subsequently choose "print" from the menu bar, I get the  
following error in Terminal:

after this, the standard OS 10.5 print dialog opens up and the print  
job is able to be completed.

Based on the error message, I guess it has something to do with me  
only compiling for x86_64. The printing does work, so this is not a  
big problem, but I thought I should report it.

As you can see this is some strange Dell (yuck!) drivers in your  
system (which are apparently 32-bit only), this has nothing to do with  
R, really ...

Message-ID: <29C9A146-9A46-4619-A751-C96E707387C6@cisunix.unh.edu>

Hi,

	I produced the attached black and white map in R using following set  
of commands.

par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(Z.pop, main = "Mp",col = gray(seq(0.0,1,0.01)))
contour(sk.pop, add=TRUE, nlev = 6, col = gray(1))
plot(Z1.vmt, main = "Mv",col = gray(seq(0.0,1,0.01)))
contour(sk1.vmt, add=TRUE, nlev = 6, col = gray(1))

Z.pop <- as.im(stuff)  where stuff is a spatstat ppp file.


The attached black and white pdf file shown here, which was saved in  
R, gives a black and light gray grid-like pattern that doesn't exist.
The attached map will not produce this image in Adode Acrobat Reader.  
It can be opened in Preview.

A black and white map looks great in R. These issues do not exist when  
"col = heat.color", etc. i.e. a color palette. In fact, Adode Acrobat  
Reader opens the file without a problem. It suggests to me that the  
black and white map is corrupted.

A method to solve this problem would be greatly appreciated.


Thanks

Paul

Given that this pops up every now and then I have added it to the FAQ.

Thanks a lot. Unfortunately the Dell drivers are there by design - our  
lab printer is a Dell and I need those drivers to print duplex.

Sure, that's easily done using Quartz directly:
quartz.save("foo.tiff",type="tiff")

For a journal you may want to increase the dpi, e.g.:
quartz.save("foo.tiff",type="tiff",dpi=300)

Since Quartz knows that you're generating a bitmap it will snap the  
pixel boundaries for rectangles accordingly.

If you don't want a transparent background, you can use Quartz  
directly to do the drawing and force bg="white":

quartz(file="foo.tiff",type="tiff",dpi=300,bg="white")
# do your plotting here ... (you can also set width/height above see ? 
quartz)
dev.off()

Cheers,
Simon

Why?  R has several tiff() devices, so why are you shunning them?

Not a good idea.  Use ghostscript if you must, via bitmap() (and make 
sure antialiasing is off there).

Hmm, what is 'Scottish' about it?

Message-ID: <7F0A4DA6-9EE2-4C35-9E19-431B1FD2191A@plessthan.com>

Colleagues,

I am trying to read a file that contains the ? (mu character).
readLines is succcessful and shows the following:
	"\xb5g/mL\"

read.csv yields the following:

using a text editor, i replaced all occurrences of ? (mu) - at which  
point read.csv worked properly.

Although my work-around was successful, I am wondering whether there  
is some means to accomplish this without editing the source document:
1.  is it possible to inform R to read the character in its natural  
form?
2.  if not, I could execute readLines, then do a gsub (which did not  
work - any ideas of how to formulate the regular expression would be  
appreciated). then write to a tempfile and read in again (or use a  
textConnection).

Please read ?read.csv, most notably about encoding. Apparently your  
file is in Latin1 so have forgotten to specify encoding="latin1".

Message-ID: <49432AB8-A5D5-4D9C-9E54-C27ED1479E0A@tidewater.net>

Hello,

I have a new Mac OSX 10.5 iMac running R 2.8.1.  Using Finder, I  
manually created a folder for R source code as /Users/Shared/code/R.

If I use R.app's "Misc>Change Working Directory..." menu dialog to  
navigate to /Users/Shared/code/R and then use getwd() to print the  
directory path, the components of the path are separated with colons  
as shown:  /Users/Shared/Shared:code/Shared:code:R

The R function file.path() does not produces these colon-ized paths.

I have pasted below the commands I used as well as the output of  
sessionInfo().  Additionally, I have provided the output of the ls  
command from the Terminal which also appears to use the colon-ized form.

I cannot replicate this issue in OSX 10.4.11 and R 2.8.1.  I am not  
sure how to proceed and suggestions are most welcome.

Thanks,
Ben

Why should it? The colon is part of the name - the name of your  
directory is "Shared:code" so the proper use of file.path is
 > file.path("/Users","Shared","Shared:Code","Shared:code:R")
[1] "/Users/Shared/Shared:Code/Shared:code:R"

BTW: I suspect you are not quite aware of what you're doing in your  
Finder - you're creating files/directories that have a slash in their  
name which the Finder re-maps to colons. This has nothing to do with R  
- it's a historic work-around in the Finder from times when / was  
valid in file names in OS 9 and I suspect you didn't really mean to  
create those files/directories that way...

Cheers,
S

Bingo!  Thanks for the explanation, Simon.  Your hunch that each  
manually created directory was created with a "/" prefix is exactly  
right. You are right that it was unintentional, and I won't even try  
to explain how that happened.

Thanks again and cheers,
Ben

I now have a 64-bit Mac (10.5.6), and probably the abilities. If you 
could collect together the relevant posts, I will endeavour to take a 
look (unless Simon has already got there).  Please post a follow-up 
posting for future reference, and include the rgl maintainers (who I 
suspect do not read R-sig-mac).

At least one of us does, and I'd be happy to make changes to the 
configure script if someone tells me what to do.

I'm still on a 32 bit laptop, but no longer have access to 10.4, so 
support for that version may decay quite rapidly.

This is very exciting; I wasn't expecting such a prompt response.  The  
only references I have found are these two threads from nearly a year  
ago:

Thanks for giving this a look.

FWIW you don't really need a 64-bit Mac to work on this ;).
Nonetheless it's not a trivial task because the current implementation  
uses deprecated API so it essentially means to re-write the UI part  
almost entirely. I suspect that's the reason why I have not seen any  
volunteers yet ... (I had a look, but when I saw the scope I could not  
dedicate enough time to do it ...).

rgl attempts on OS X to build both X11 and 'Carbon' versions.  You can 
inhibit the latter by

R CMD INSTALL --configure-args='--disable-carbon'  .../rgl_0.81.tar.gz

The X11 version does work -- had you not tried that?

A native Mac OS X version will be a lot more work, so to encourage 
people you will need to explain what is not enough in the X11 version.

I was referring to the native version alone. I guess I have  
misinterpreted the original question. I have a prototype of the native  
version that could be used in 64-bit if anyone is keen enough to clean  
up rgl... Either way IMHO the configure script should check whether  
the Carbon version can be built at all.

Thanks.  I was indeed trying to build a Carbon version.  I'd love to  
see it run natively -- it would surely look a lot better, and it seems  
to me that pretty graphics are the whole point of this package -- but  
X11 works fine for me.  Sorry for the bother.

I have an ongoing need to read a real-time data stream via the USB  
port on a MacBook Pro (OS 10.5.6). I have several different hardware  
sources, including commercial rs-232 instruments and a number of  
microcontrollers, such as the Atmega168  or Hitachi H8, but my  
question is generic to any serial I/O device, I think. To date, I have  
been content to interact with the microcontroller via terminal.app,  
where the 'screen' function allows me to exchange data with the card  
and to capture the incoming ASCII text stream to disk. From within R,  
this ASCII data file is then read and processed.

Since it is independent of the R read.table() command,  I'm sure it  
has to do with the details of the 'screen' implementatation or OS time- 
sharing. The problem is that the data appears to be written to disk at  
irregular  intervals, and it lags what is actually being received/ 
displayed by 2-3 seconds. While this has not been a problem to date, I  
will soon need more "real time" access to the serial port, and I was  
wondering if there was a way to access it directly from within R i.e.  
a serial port communications library for R. Simple ASCII text read- 
write is all I require.  I have not had any luck with attempts to  
search this group and google for  "serial", "rs-232", "usb"," i/o"  
etc, but  I was wondering if any one has any experience they'd be  
willing to share with inputting serial port data directly into R on  
the Mac?

Hello,

Do you know Python programming language ? If yes, you can consider
these packages :

RS232 / USB acquisition python library : http://pyvisa.sourceforge.net
And the robust Python interface to the R programming language : Rpy ,
http://rpy.sourceforge.net

You can acquire data and regularly send vector to R using Rpy.

My two cents,

Bests regards, C.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] How to compare two regression line slopes
Message-ID: <161DA234-91CF-4082-BF14-ABD1F8045DAA@ulb.ac.be>

Hi,

I've made a research about how to compare two regression line slopes  
(of y versus x for 2 groups, "group" being a factor ) using R.

I knew the method based on the following statement :
t = (b1 - b2) / sb1,b2
where b1 and b2 are the two slope coefficients and sb1,b2 the pooled  
standard error of the slope (b)

which can be calculated in R this way:
 > df1 <- data.frame(x=1:3, y=1:3+rnorm(3))
 > df2 <- data.frame(x=1:3, y=1:3+rnorm(3))
 > fit1 <- lm(y~x, df1)
 > s1 <- summary(fit1)$coefficients
 > fit2 <- lm(y~x, df2)
 > s2 <- summary(fit2)$coefficients
 > db <- (s2[2,1]-s1[2,1])
 > sd <- sqrt(s2[2,2]^2+s1[2,2]^2)
 > df <- (fit1$df.residual+fit2$df.residual)
 > td <- db/sd
 > 2*pt(-abs(td), df)
[1] 0.9510506

However, I also found a procedure in Wonnacott & Wonnacott, that is  
based on the use of a mute variable D that will have a binary value  
according to the group to which a given point belongs (group : D=0;  
group 2: D=1). Then the equation that is computed is as follow:
y = b0 + b1.x + D.b2.x

which can be computed in R with:
 > fit <- lm(y ~ group + x + x:group)
where y is the response of the 2 groups.
The p-value of x:group gives the probability for the two slopes to be  
different, and the estimated values of parameters are these of both  
populations.

These two methods have already been described in the mailing list but  
not confronted and discussed.
So, my questions are:
- are these methods different ?
- which one should be preferentially used ?

I don't think I'm really clear and I know I'm not rigorous at all in  
my descriptions, but I hope someone will understand me.

Thanks,

Etienne

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Possible mac-specific bug in svg (cairo) graphics
Message-ID: <B6730159-7BB3-43CC-B5E2-0964643D4C10@pixie.org.uk>

Hi,

Using the Mac OS X binary (R 2.8.1) from CRAN, generating SVG files  
with italics produces bold text instead. I reported this to R-bugs,  
and as it seems to be a Mac-specific problem, I was advised to report  
it here.

As a test case, try viewing the test.svg file generated by

svg("test.svg", width=4,4,8)
plot.new()
text(0.5,0.5,labels=expression(italic("This should be in italics")))
dev.off()

On my system (OS X 10.4.11) viewing the SVG file either in Safari  
3.2.1 or Firefox 2.0.0.9 shows bold text.

Cheers

Yan

I think you got the corresponding response to your post before -  
cairographics cannot locate an italic version of the font - switching  
to a font which has the desired traits will produce the desired  
output, e.g.:

svg("test.svg", width=4,4,8)
par(family="Arial")
plot.new()
text(0.5,0.5,labels=expression(italic("This should be in italics")))
dev.off()

Cheers,
S

Ah, sorry, my bad - I forgot that you're on 10.4 and I was testing  
with 10.5. I do remember that 10.4 is missing italics from several  
default fonts (e.g. Helvetica). You can enable fontconfig debug using  
FC_DEBUG=1 -- that will at least tell you what fontconfig found.

To make things worse, FreeType on Mac is quite buggy and screws up  
numbering of fonts within a container which results in incorrect  
styles - it is something we try to work around, but if FT recognizes  
the wrong style we can't do anything about it. From what I can see  
this is what happens -- the main difference between 10.4 and 10.5 is  
that Arial and friends are supplied as (rf-style) font suitcases in  
10.4 which is what FT has trouble dealing with. In 10.5 they come as  
individual fonts which FT can deal with just fine.

I know that this is catching straws, but of one the few fonts that  
come as TTF in 10.4 is "Euphemia UCAS", so this will produce italic  
output even on 10.4:

svg("test.svg", width=4,4,8)
par(family="Euphemia UCAS")
plot.new()
text(0.5,0.5,labels=expression(italic("This should be in italics")))
dev.off()

Although this is a nuisance, working around bugs in 3rd party  
libraries on older systems is not high on my priority list, os I  
cannot promise anything, but maybe I'll get to it...

All styles are in a single file and FT picks the wrong one,  
unfortunately.

FC_DEBUG=1 may help, but FT/cairographics don't have any debugging env  
vars AFAIR.

Hi,
 is there something similar to rcom on OSX? I understand that R for OSX
has some limited applescript support, but I was wondering if there is an
easy way to share data with other applications. My ultimate goal would
be to use R together with a spreadsheet as I can currently do on windows
with R, rcom and Excel.

Thanks

Well, the subject has apparently noting to do with your question. All  
I can say is you can use AppleScript to run commands in R from other  
applications and you can use the default AS libraries to otherwise  
control R -- so you, you can script R. In addition, R can easily share  
data with any application that supports data sharing. I have no idea  
about Excel on Mac OS X since I don't use it, so someone would have to  
find out if it supports data exchange and how.

Cheers,
S

Sorry for appending an unrelated conversation, just lazyness on my side.
About the post topic, I did not really know how to name it, but since I
was under the impression that a more complete applescript dictionnary fr
R-OSX could achieve what I am loooking for, I chose to name it thus.

So, going back to the real topic, could you please elaborate on what
"application that support data sharing" means? Is this some COM-like
protocol?
This would be of interest not only relating to Excel for OSX, but also
other sw, like OpenOffice or Numbers.

Thanks,

If you think so - what is missing? How would you envision it?

Whatever the application supports. This is not about R - this is about  
the application that uses R. R doesn't really care - since it can be  
linked as shared library it can be embedded into any application. The  
reason R uses COM on Windows (and that's only one of many ways BTW) is  
that it's what Excel supports if - R couldn't care less ;).

The problem here again is that it would be of interest for those if  
they supported the same interface. I know at least that Numbers  
doesn't allow 3rd party extensions, so AppleScript is what you have to  
use (and you'll need iWork '09). For OpenOffice there is already the  
"R and Calc" add-on.

Cheers,
Simon

Simon,

> If you think so - what is missing? How would you envision it?

In the same way as Excel plugins for Matlab, R etc work in windows.
Currently R-OSX has an Applescript dictionnary with a single instruction
'cmd', which allows "remote execution" of R statements. What I have in
mind are two further instructions 'getdata' and 'putdata' that allow to
move objects from R to whatever application is accessing R via
Applescript. This way every half-serious OSX application can make use of
R's calculation power.

Thanks
Christian

Emiliano,
what you suggest I have already implemented, although it is a bit
sluggish, especially if moving back and forth big chunks of data.
The reason I am looking into this is that on windows platforms in my
organization many people are using Excel as a frontend and R as a
calculation workhorse. Most people are familiar with organizing and
handling data in Excel, and though I agree that complex datasets are
better handled directly by R, some tasks work very well with the above
mentioned setup.
I am currently trying to push for a move to OSX, and having very similar
tools available would be of great help and smooth the transition.

Since this part of the thread is more about Excel/R GUI data copying  
-- the easiest solution is to use clipboard and it's easily scriptable:

* select a table in Excel
* Copy (<Cmd><C>)
* switch to R and run
   read.table(pipe("pbpaste -"),T,"\t")

-- if you didn't include column headers in the paste operation use  
instead:
  read.table(pipe("pbpaste -"),F,"\t")

Clearly, the above is done best with AS:

tell application "Microsoft Excel" to activate
tell application "System Events"
	tell process "Microsoft Excel"
		click menu item "Copy" of menu "Edit" of menu bar 1
	end tell
end tell
tell application "R"
	activate
	cmd "read.table(pipe('pbpaste -'),T,'\\t')"
end tell

(You can actually remove the "Microsoft Excel" parts and it will work  
with any active app such as Numbers)

Bind to a key and all you have to do is to select your table and hit  
that key ...

Cheers,
Simon

As I said in my earlier e-mail AFAICS neither Microsoft nor Apple  
support plugins and for OO there is already a plugin.

Something along those lines could be done -- probably more natural to  
the AS approach abstracting something like a workspace object.  
Nonetheless I'm not sure this helps with your problem, because this is  
more about UIs talking to each other than proper computing  
capabilities. (E.g. it will be likely a pain to use anything bu simple  
numbers/vectors). But at least it would be something to play with.

However, this is an entirely different question. I'm not sure AS is  
the best tool for this purpose -- but then the options are rather few  
due to lack of plugins ...

Simon

Simon,

Thanks, I will checkout the OO plugin, this might be the best immediate
solution

FWIW, RExcel allows passing only scalars, arrays and dataframes between
R and Excel. It would be pointless to try to accomodate any "exotic" R
datatypes on a spreadsheet.

Just for curiosity, why do you think AS would not do? I am relatively
new to the OSX platform, but I thought that the "pervasiveness" of
Applescript would eliminate the need for any sort of plugin architecture
since every application can "export" features via an appropriate
dictionnary that may then be accessed system-wide.

Hmm .. I thought it can do plots and such ... (and BTW a dataframe is

For AS to work you need two "native" UI applications. Ideally, to  
embed R in Excel you don't want all that - you just want Excel to be  
able to access R's functions by embedding R (at least that's what I  
would do ;P). Note that I have no clue about Excel on a Mac, so I  
don't even know whether you can use formulae in Excel that will map to  
AS requests which is the minimal requirement for this to make any  
sense ... Anyway, I may look into adding some push/pull AS facilities  
to the R GUI and we'll see whether it will be useful for anything or  
not ...

Cheers,

Thanks. I tried this with family="Arial", family="Times",  
family="serif", family="sans", family="Verdana", and family="mono",  
and they all come out as bold.

I guess if this doesn't happen on other systems, then is must be a  
problem with my R or system setup. Unfortunately I don't have another  
system  to try this out on.

The italic versions of Arial, Time, and Verdana are all available,  
according to Font Book.

Have you any suggestions as to how I could try and find out what is  
going on here? Can I activate some sort of debugging or verbose mode  
in Cairographics?

Cheers

Yan

Hi!

maybe my reply will be too foolish... but I'll try anyway!

Can't you just use .CSV as an interface format between any spreadsheet
software and R?

That makes data sharing really very simple by using read.csv and
read.csv2 to get the data into R, and then write.csv and write.csv2
to save for the spreadsheet.

I imagine you can easily make an Applescript wrapper to make the
transition look a lot more like a GUI feature...
but then, why on earth would you need to use something like Excel
when you are already using R???

anyway, good luck!

E.

I managed to figure this out after playing with it a bit (using the  
Cairo package allows you to control what font styles are used).  
Oddly, the CairoFontMatch() function correctly identifies a font  
using the normal font specs, but then the Cairo() call doesn't seem  
to use the same one.

In case other people have the same problem, I got around it by using  
a 3rd party utility (fontu) to separate out the faces within the  
Verdana font file into separate .ttf files, which were then used  
sensibly by CairoSVG.

Of course - don't worry about it, and thanks for the help.
