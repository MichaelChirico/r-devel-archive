Carl,

any reason why you're not using more reliable and faster solutions like FastRWeb? ;)
Anyway, your R code is not syntactically legal, so I would not be surprised if you don't see anything (open2 doesn't cover STDERR AFAIR). If I were you, I'd not use embedded code to start with -- you'd make your life (=debugging) much easier if you simply evaluated something like try(source('..foo.R'),silent=TRUE) -- and you don't need such complicated contraptions for that, actually ...

Cheers,
Simon

Yes, so your freetype setup is broken as the message says. Any reason why your'e trying to compile this from sources when the binary is available from CRAN? I would suggest you use the binary unless you really know what you're doing (obviously you can replicate the CRAN setup but apparently you chose not to).

Cheers,
Simon

Fair enough - the 64-bit iconv has different symbols than at the time ft was built so the 64-bit build fails. So for now you'll have to stick with R --arch i386 for the Cairo binary. In the meantime I'll see if I can build a fresh set of static ft that will work with the current iconv - it's a bit convoluted as we need a build that won't use CF so Cairo can be forked (for multicore, Rserve etc.).

Cheers,
Simon

Dear Simon,

thanks for all. I'll stick to  arch i386.

	new GUI features!
Message-ID: <D8CB57D0-9A87-48E8-898A-6E64915C9EF3@r-project.org>

It's the time of the year to test the new upcoming R release, but this time I'd like to ask as many users as possible to give the new R a spin, because there are many new features in the Mac GUI which increases the likelihood of bugs. It can be downloaded, as usual, from

http://r.research.att.com/

and for those of you that like deep links you probably want

http://r.research.att.com/R-2.13-branch-leopard.pkg

The new features in R itself can be found in the usual place, but this time the focus is also on the GUI and you can get list of new features in the GUI at
https://svn.r-project.org/R-packages/trunk/Mac-GUI/NEWS
Essentially the internal editor has been much re-written thanks to Hans-J?rg Bibiko and thus is much faster, more versatile (encoding selection, better auto-competion) and features shortcuts you know from Xcode (like <Ctrl><H> for help on the current function). Other parts have been improved as well, help pages are now searchable and so is the history, you can use <Cmd><Enter> in most web views and other lists like Data Manager can be sorted. Finally, for your safety document auto-save feature has been added such that open documents are automatically restored even in the [unlikely ;)] case of an R crash.

So, please, consider testing the release candidates in the next week or two and report any bugs you should find. This is true both for R itself and the R.app GUI.

Thanks,
Simon

I notice that this version hangs when I run the examples for the
ezMixed function in the ez package. Some play
(https://gist.github.com/909934) reveals that is might have something
to do with the custom progress bar I use in ezMixed, but I can get
more minimal examples just using the progress bar to work, and
furthermore, if one simply runs through the code in ezMixed
line-by-line (instead of using it as a function), the hang does not
occur. When I replace the custom progress bar with the standard text
progress bar, the function works fine.

Any thoughts?

Mike

I have been playing around with the editor and the Help on the current function.
Ctrl+H operates reasonably well but the behaviour can be slightly strange

In the examples that follow, | indicates the position of the caret.

So with

Pressing Ctrl+H will give the help page for aggregate.

However in this case

aggre|gate(df[...

the word aggregate is entered in the Help search field. 

And in this case

getOption("verbose")
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(doBy))
summ|aryBy(height + weight + age ~ sample, data = df, FUN = mean)

with the caret within summaryBy I got help for options.
But if the caret is in the word "library" I'll get the help page for message.

I expected that Ctrl+H would first try to get help for the current word containing the caret/cursor just as it does in TextMate using the R bundle. And if that fails looks backwards.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Which gcc version on mac os?
Message-ID: <699800B9-1E43-41B6-AA30-FB47423A6E64@gmail.com>

Dear all,

I use R 2.12.2 to build, install and check my packages, in particular randtoolbox. On my macbook with OS X 10.6.7, the gcc installed is
i686-apple-darwin10-gcc-4.2.1 (GCC) 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5666) (dot 3) . From http://r.research.att.com/tools/, I have also downloaded gfortran (GNU Fortran (GCC) 4.2.3).

With this framework, I do not get any error and warnings on the randtoolbox package.

But using gcc 4.6 on linux, Kurt Hornik get the following errors in the only one Fortran file of the package:

LowDiscrepancy.f:180.26:

        QN(I, J) = HQNORM(QUASI(J))                                    
                         1
Error: Return type mismatch of function 'hqnorm' at (1) (REAL(4)/REAL(8))
LowDiscrepancy.f:1393.29:

                    TEMP1 = TEMP1 + TEMP01                             
                            1
Warning: Possible change of value in conversion from REAL(4) to INTEGER(4) at (1)
LowDiscrepancy.f:405.29:

           QN(I, J) = SQNORM(QUASI(J))                                 
                            1
Error: Return type mismatch of function 'sqnorm' at (1) (REAL(4)/REAL(8))
make: *** [LowDiscrepancy.o] Error 1


My first question is which is the standard version of gcc to use? from http://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_flavors.html#r-release-macosx-ix86, it should gcc 4.2.1 ? If I have to update gcc, where can I find the binaries? 

My second question, in the case I can reproduce this error on my macbook or a linux, the fortran errors are a wrong type between the QN variable and the return value of HQNORM. Looking at the LowDiscrepancy.f file, both QN and the return type of QNORM are DOUBLE PRECISION. Does anyone have a guess where is the problem?

Thanks in advance

Christophe

Looking at your Fortran code, I think you have just been  lucky.

HQNORM is not declared with a type in the routine you are using it. Implicit declaration most likely implies it is real (real*4). But later on it is typed as double precision. Asking for trouble.

Temp01 is not declared and thus implicitly real*4 (most likely).

gcc-4.2.1 comes with Xcode. And gfortran must be obtained from http://r.research.att.com/tools/
and should match the Xcode version. That's all.

But looking at that page I don't see a gfortran available for Apple gcc 5666 (from Xcode 3.2.6?).
I am using gfortran 5664 with Xcode 3.2.5.

Simon knows more about this.

Yes.
Declare ALL variables. With implicit fortran typing you can run into all sorts of trouble.

Test compile your Fortran with

gfortran -c -fsyntax-only -fimplicit-none LowDiscrepancy.f

You'll get a shock.
Always at least test with -fimplicit-none.

Yes I'm using Xcode 3.2.6. So you advise me to use Xcode 3.2.5 with gcc build 5664 ? 

Regarding the fortran problem, for my defense I'm not the original author of this code, but only the maintainer. But thank you for the command line gfortran -c -fsyntax-only -fimplicit-none. I will update the code to declare all variables.

Regards

Christophe

I'm not an expert on that subject.  Simon will know if you can combine Xcode 3.2.6 with 5664.

That's the best option. It will save you a lot of hair pulling.

It is not related to your problem but essentially it is safe to use 5664 gfortran with both gcc 5664 and gcc 5666 because the only change between 5664 and 5666 was related to ppc build on 10.6 which it irrelevant to our 10.5 build so the binaries are identical.

Cheers,
Simon

Suggestion: do as we ask and send ESS questions to ess-help (see the R 
FAQ).

Also: follow the R posting guide and so not irritate us by sending

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] biOps and fftw3
Message-ID: <4DA4C907.5040909@witthoft.com>

I have successfully installed biOps, at least in the sense that the 
package loads and many of the functions work.  The question I have now 
is how to get biOps to recognize fftw3 during compilation.

I installed fftw3 from a Terminal session, and "make check" passed 
successfully.  The files residing in /usr/local/lib are

libfftw3.a	libfftw3.la

I checked for the existence of a certain item(?) as:

% grep fftw_plan_dft libff*
Binary file libfftw3.a matches

But then, when I ask the Package Installer in Rgui.app to install biOps 
from the localsource tarball, I get:

* installing *source* package ?biOps? ...
checking for gcc... gcc -arch i386 -std=gnu99
checking for C compiler default output file name... a.out
checking whether the C compiler works... yes
checking whether we are cross compiling... no
checking for suffix of executables...
checking for suffix of object files... o
checking whether we are using the GNU C compiler... yes
checking whether gcc -arch i386 -std=gnu99 accepts -g... yes
checking for gcc -arch i386 -std=gnu99 option to accept ISO C89... none 
needed
checking for TIFFOpen in -ltiff... yes
checking for jpeg_destroy_compress in -ljpeg... yes
checking for fftw_plan_dft in -lfftw3... no
checking how to run the C preprocessor... gcc -arch i386 -std=gnu99 -E
checking for grep that handles long lines and -e... /usr/bin/grep
checking for egrep... /usr/bin/grep -E

(and more)

So, my question is: how come the checker doesn't "see" fftw_plan_dft ?

biOps library will load, and other functions like,say imgBlur run fine, 
and in case it helps, the error message I get if I try to run one of the 
fft routines is:

Error in .C("fft_image", image = as.complex(imgmatrix), width = 
as.integer(width),  :
   C symbol name "fft_image" not in DLL for package "biOps"

Thanks

Carl

That's the wrong question -- the question is why does the check fail? And you'll get the answer only by looking at config.log. Since you didn't share that important part you'll have to either figure it out yourself or include that detail ;). Note that static libraries don't cascade dependencies, so you have to make sure they are included in your flags or the configure is written well enough to know about them.

Cheers,
Simon

An issue I have found using with the GUI is in relation with scrolling through an R script open within the R GUI. If one opens an R script long enough to allow for scrolling and places the script window floating over any other window (including other applications), and then scrolls, the scrolling of the script window effects the windows underneath the script window. The effect on the windows behind the script window is minimal, and the scrolling must be at a slow pace.

Simon,

I'd like to give this a test, but I can't afford to loose the use of my current installation. The installer says:

Requirements:
- Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard) or 10.6 (Snow Leopard)

Note: By default the installer upgrades previous Leopard build of R  if present. If you want to keep the previous Leopard build, use
pkgutil --forget org.r-project.R.Leopard.fw.pkg

I thought it would just be installed in the Versions directory of the R.framework and the symlink changed, but maybe this is not so?

I'm on 10.6.6 - I'm not sure if that means that it will replace any leopard versions that exist (but not snow leopard?), of if I need to use the  "pkgutil --forget org.r-project.R.Leopard.fw.pkg" command. Not knowing anything about this, do I just run that command in terminal in my home directory, or does it need to be done in the R directory. Will it then go ahead and install, or do I run it and then use the installer? Will it mean I can use RSwitch? 

Sorry about the lack of adventurousness, but I really can't afford to loose my current stable install as I'm "on-demand" to produce and modify analyses.

Cheers

Ben

Using the R 2.13 beta version I noticed that when one executes a graphic command from the new internal editor and then closes the graph window, the control is always returned to the R console and not to the editor. This is a bit annoying because it requires to jump across windows many times.

Hope this helps for the testing.

Best regards.

It's way to late - R 2.13.0 is already released so you may as well forget it all and install the new version ;).

No, Apple's installer keeps track of files installed by the same product and will upgrade it - i.e. remove files that are not in the new version. Unfortunately AFAIK the Installer has no provision to change that behavior (there is a reason for that since that would make it much harder to keep track which files were installed by which package and which version ...).


> I'm on 10.6.6 - I'm not sure if that means that it will replace any leopard versions that exist (but not snow leopard?),

There is no "snow leopard" version.


> of if I need to use the  "pkgutil --forget org.r-project.R.Leopard.fw.pkg" command. Not knowing anything about this, do I just run that command in terminal in my home directory, or does it need to be done in the R directory. Will it then go ahead and install, or do I run it and then use the installer? Will it mean I can use RSwitch?

The pkgutil just tells the system to forget about the installed R framework so it won't know about it when upgrading and thus it won't delete its files. It doesn't install anything.

As I said, you're way too late anyway, but thanks for the thought.

Ciao Sergio,

many thanks for the hint!

We've improved/fixed it for the next R.app (1.41) release. For the time being you can use the short-cut ?2 (Switch to last Editor Window) to set the key input focus back to the last editor window.

Kind regards,

Dear list members,

I'm experiencing a problem checking packages with R 2.13.0 on a new Mac OS X 10.6.7 system. As far as I can tell, R isn't finding my LaTeX installation. Packages seem to build fine. Some details follow:

Here's what happens when I try to check a package:

----- snip ------

* this is package ?car? version ?2.0-10?
. . .

This typically indicates Rd problems.
LaTeX errors found:

I get the following error when I try to check the package under eclipse/StatET (deleting the lines before the error):


----- snip ------

This typically indicates Rd problems.

Assuming this is the CRAN build of R, it is looking on the path.  So 
all I can think is that you have the path set incorrectly somewhere in 
your R statrtup files.

Dear Brian and others,

Yes, I installed the CRAN build of R, and yes, something is changing the
path in R.app, and in eclipse, but not apparently when R is run in a
terminal window.

>From a terminal window:

------------- snip --------------

John-Foxs-MacBook-Pro:Rmpi jfox$ R

R version 2.13.0 (2011-04-13)
Copyright (C) 2011 The R Foundation for Statistical Computing ISBN
3-900051-07-0
Platform: x86_64-apple-darwin9.8.0/x86_64 (64-bit)

. . .

> Sys.getenv("PATH")
[1] "/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/texbin:/usr/X11/bin"

------------- snip --------------

In R.app (and in R64.app):

------------- snip --------------

R version 2.13.0 (2011-04-13)
Copyright (C) 2011 The R Foundation for Statistical Computing ISBN
3-900051-07-0
Platform: i386-apple-darwin9.8.0/i386 (32-bit)

. . .

[R.app GUI 1.40 (5751) i386-apple-darwin9.8.0]

[History restored from /Users/jfox/.Rapp.history]

> Sys.getenv("PATH")
[1] "/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin"

------------- snip --------------

And in eclipse:

------------- snip --------------

R version 2.13.0 (2011-04-13)
Copyright (C) 2011 The R Foundation for Statistical Computing ISBN
3-900051-07-0
Platform: x86_64-apple-darwin9.8.0/x86_64 (64-bit)

. . .

> Sys.getenv("PATH")
[1]
"/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.13/Resources/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/
usr/sbin:/sbin"

------------- snip --------------

I've had no luck, however, figuring out what's changing the path: As far as
I can tell, I have no Rprofile.site file, no .Rprofile file, and the
R_PROFILE and R_PROFILE_USER environment variables are unset. In fact the
only R initialization files that I could find anywhere on my system are the
Rprofile files in the base and Rmpi packages; as far as I can see, the
former can't shorten the path and I'm not using the latter.

Finally, looking more closely at the errors I'm getting when I try to check
a package, the errors in a terminal window and from eclipse look different:

>From a terminal window, I think that pdflatex is actually found; to repeat
the error message:

------------- snip --------------

* checking PDF version of manual ... WARNING LaTeX errors when
creating PDF version.
This typically indicates Rd problems.
LaTeX errors found:
!pdfTeX error: pdflatex (file 8r.enc): cannot open encoding file for
reading ==> Fatal error occurred, no output PDF file produced!
* checking PDF version of manual without hyperrefs or index ... ERROR

------------- snip --------------

>From eclipse, pdflatex clearly isn't found:

------------- snip --------------

* checking PDF version of manual ... WARNING LaTeX errors when
creating PDF version.
This typically indicates Rd problems.
* checking PDF version of manual without hyperrefs or index ... ERROR
Re-running with no redirection of stdout/stderr.
Hmm ... looks like a package
You may want to clean up by 'rm -rf
/var/folders/ay/ayD+f6yQFomFC5SGQV6vP++++TI/-Tmp-
//RtmpopONVs/Rd2pdf16f793c'
Error in texi2dvi("Rd2.tex", pdf = (out_ext == "pdf"), quiet = FALSE,  :
pdflatex is not available
Error in running tools::texi2dvi

------------- snip --------------

So there are possibly two independent problems here.

I'm not sure where to look next, so again any help would be appreciated.

Best,
 John

John,

I don't know about Eclipse, but on a Mac it is completely standard
that a GUI does not inherit anything from .bashrc/.profile.  So it is
pretty standard that you may have problems with environment variables.
 You can do two things
  (1) use environment.plist (google it)
  (2) use Sys.setenv() inside your .Rprofile

Now, regarding latex, the standard on Mac would be to run MacTex.  I
am unaware of how R.app deals with MacTex but I would be ready to
guess that the PATH might be semi-build in (I am sure some of the
R.app people will correct me on this).  So you might want to add info
about what tex distribution you are using.

Kasper

That helps a bit. That is, I didn't previously have a .Rprofile file, so I
put one in my home directory, setting the PATH to
/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/texbin:/usr/X11/bin. Now
both R CMD check in a terminal window and checking inside eclipse fail with
the same error, "!pdfTeX error: pdflatex (file 8r.enc): cannot open encoding
file (etc.)", rather than with different errors. So, at this point, I don't
think that finding pdflatex is the issue.

Good point. I used the MacTeX-2010 distribution, which I got to from item
2.1 in the R for Mac OS X FAQ.

Thanks for trying to help.

Since this is a new Mac, what file system are you using?  I have no
idea on how to troubleshoot your error, but I guess that info about
the file system might help more knowledgeable people.

Or could this be e problem with the encoding of (one of) the help
files in the package?

I'm afraid I don't know how to answer: I didn't make any changes to the file
system that came with the machine. Don't Macs use the HFS+ file system?

I don't think so: The car package checks on my Windows 7 system, on an older
Mac, and on R-Forge.

Thanks again for trying to help.

John,

Having resolved the path issues, I think you do have a problem with 
your latex installation.  Try (in the terminal)

tystie% kpsewhich 8r.enc
/usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf-dist/fonts/enc/dvips/base/8r.enc

If that comes back empty, try (possibly with sudo) tystie% texhash to 
rebuild the indices.  If that doesn't work, you need to work out how 
you have an incomplete installation, something I've never seen with 
Mactex.

(FWIW 8r.enc is what tells latex how to encode output for Type 1 
fonts: it is nothing to do with the encoding of the latex inputs.)

Brian

Dear Brian,

Thank you very much for this. I'm in my office today without my MacBook but will give this a try tonight.

Yep. The only issue I had with Lion is that window services detection doesn't work anymore so you get X11 instead of Quartz by default. I'll look into that at some point.
Thanks,

I did not notice the issue because Rprofile.site for my CLI R has options=quartz. As for C++
the only problem I have found with clang so far is with Armadillo (Rcpp is fine).

Well, I am using R in Terminal.app or RStudio and I do not use Universal Binaries, only x86_64-apple-darwin10, so I use a plain gfortran from the gcc 4.7.0 svn. No problems so far, but I did not expect any because most of the fortran use in R is pretty straightforward.

I was using simply the Fortran from CRAN which is dated but works well. Depending what Apple does to gcc we may have to switch the official build to what Jan is using with Apple drivers but given the uncertainty I'll wait for now before making that decision.

Cheers,

Dear Brian,

That is indeed empty.

(I'm just lucky, I guess.) I tried this and it didn't fix the problem. 

I then reinstalled MacTeX-2010, taking all of the defaults in the installer, as I did before, and that fixed the problem. Obviously, my original TeX installation was broken.

I don't think that I should have to set the PATH explicitly in my .Rprofile when I use eclipse (I've never had to before, on any platform), but that works too. I'll investigate further and maybe send a message to the StatET list.

Thank you for all of your help -- I really appreciate it. 

John

"know" where to look.  But that does depend on the program you use.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] problem with mac gui and mvtnorm for R2.14.0 (unstable)
Message-ID: <p0624081ac9d51dff05c0@[165.124.164.22]>

Dear Mac R users and developers,

mvtnorm when used in the Mac.app Gui crashes R2.14.0 (unstable).

This does not happen when using R in X windows or when using Rstudio, 
nor does it happen with R2.13.0

I note that my version of R2.14.0 is a month old, but the most recent 
version does not seem to available from the research.att.com page.

Best wishes and thanks for all the work.

Bill

For a good reason - it fails tests. Once you get a fresh build that works we can talk again - but note that R-devel is currently "unstable" so you should not expect it to work at this point anyway.

Cheers,

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] svg & cairo support in 2.12.2 and higher?
Message-ID: <BANLkTikoRgGzQRVM-RyTv_5pr-CaAsNCFw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm not sure if this is the best list for my question, so please let
me know if I should direct this elsewhere.

When I used R version 2.12.0 on my Mac (Platform:
x86_64-apple-darwin9.8.0/x86_64 (64-bit)), I often used svg() to
create graphics which I then edited in Inkscape.  When I updated to
2.12.2, the code that worked in 2.12.0 started returning an error,
"cairo-based devices are not supported on this build".  Same problem
in 2.13 released today.  And indeed, capabilities() returns FALSE for
cairo, whereas it used to be TRUE.

I tried using {RSvgDev}, but (1) I don't like that I cannot specify a
pointsize, (2) it ignores any color specification of text (gray text
is turned into black), and (3) the vectors come out aliased (i.e., an
'L' shaped vector becomes pixellated at the angle).  svg() did not
suffer from any of these problems.

I also tried installing {cairoDevice}, but when I try to load it I get this:

>require (cairoDevice)
Loading required package: cairoDevice
Error in dyn.load(file, DLLpath = DLLpath, ...) :
  unable to load shared object
'/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.13/Resources/library/cairoDevice/libs/x86_64/cairoDevice.so':
  dlopen(/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.13/Resources/library/cairoDevice/libs/x86_64/cairoDevice.so,
6): Library not loaded:
/Library/Frameworks/GTK+.framework/Versions/2.18.X11/Resources/lib/libgtk-x11-2.0.0.dylib
  Referenced from:
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.13/Resources/library/cairoDevice/libs/x86_64/cairoDevice.so
  Reason: image not found

For now I have reverted to 2.12.0, but I was wondering if there is any
way to build 2.13 with Cairo capabilities, or if anyone has advice for
getting better-quality svg's in R?

Try running 32-bit R on your platform: it does contain cairo support.
(So does my own x86_64 build of 2.13.0: looks like there is/was a 
problem on the CRAN build machine. So you could also build R from the 
sources.)

Yes.  RTFM applies (and RT posting guide too: you are expressly asked 
not to send HTML).

See ?select.list, and also ?chooseCRANmirror for how to select 
mirrors.  Look for what options(menu.graphics=FALSE) does.

Can you explain what you mean? There is no "overwriting" because each R version lives in a separate directory of the framework. They never overwrite each other even if you don't use pkgutils (if you don't Apple just *removes* the old R, it doesn't overwrite anything). Please make sure you have read R for Mac OS X FAQ - in particular 12.15 should be helpful.

/Library/Receipts refers to older OS X (10.4 and earlier) and old builds of R (for those old OS).

Well, to my best knowledge that's what's in the README. If anything is unclear about that, please explain.

The current R-2.13.0 patched builds should work as well. It has cairo updated to a more recent version for it to work in 64-bit (symbols in iconv have changed in the meantime in the OS). All upgrade libraries are available from the usual place.

Cheers,
Simon
