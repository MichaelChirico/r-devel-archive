A message today on Apple's scitech mailing list reports that using 
ATLAS resulted in an 8x speed improvement in a small fortran program 
(compiled using f2c) that relies heavily on blas routines, in OS X.

Rather than quote without permission, here's a pointer to the scitech

"optimized blas & lapack routines".

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac]R-1.3.0 full update (151 packages)
Message-ID: <200108201500.IAA41864@pine.frazmtn.com>

You may want to wait for R-1.3.1, but there is a new version 
R-1.3.0-MacOSX.tar.gz
in http//www.stat.ucla.edu/~deleeuw/R. It's in the folder "overfull", 
and it

-- will be updated to 1.3.1 as soon as that exists

-- has support for gnome, tcl/tk, and atlas

-- includes 151 add-on packages (see the list in packages.txt). Most of 
them have
    been updated to the latest CRAN versions.

-- uses the newest versions of the readline, dlcompat, gnome, f2c, 
atlas, tcl/tk libraries
    (all from fink, see fink.sourceforge.net)

-- has the necessary dylibs in the folder "dylibs". If you find you need 
one,
    because R asks for it, download it and install it. If R asks for one
    which is not there, drop me an email.

-- has five screenshots in the folder "screenshots", a small sample of 
the
    many possibilities.

    a. One has rootless XFree86 with the gnome interface for R. This may 
be as close
    to the Carbon version as you can get with Xfree.
    b. The Aqua rootless mode is fine if you want to interact directly 
with Carbon and
    Cocoa applications. The second screenshot is full screen X11, and 
proud of it.
    It has some tcl/tk demos running.
    c. The windowmanager for the first two screenshots is blackbox, and 
you see two
    fancy eterm windows running as well (with dragons and far-away 
planets and stuff).
    The third screenshot uses the sawfish window manager, running in a 
gnome-session.
    d. If you don't like gnome (most sane persons don't), then screenshot 
four
    uses the ice window manager, and shows another tcltk demo. Look in 
the lower
    left hand corner of this screen -- you are running Linux. And on a
    decent computer too.
    e. Finally, there is a screenshot which uses the Xtools Aqua window 
manager in rootless
    mode.  This is obviously close to optimal for Mac junkies. By the 
way, the gnome gui
    does not work with XTools.

Note:
Running cksum on the file it should give

3276119375 28310961 R-1.3.0-MacOSX.tar.gz

Note:
If you install fink on your system, you will have easy access to the 
following
window managers: twm, mwm, pwm, fvwm, xfwm, icewm, blackbox, 
enlightenment, windowmaker, sawfish, oroborus, afterstep. Xtools adds 
the Aqua window manager.
Thus you can make your Mac look like a machine running vanilla X11, 
Motif, NextStep, Gnome, and even Aqua/Quartz.

I've put in the R-devel archive all the makefiles and scripts necessary 
to build R (R-devel) via MPW + MacPerl + sed + f2c ... i.e. a zero cost 
environment to build R.

If any mac developer wants to test the scripts please start from 
src/macintosh/ReadMe.MPW in R-devel archive (Aug_22_2001 or later).

This build is not completely bug free (I have to fix some stuff) but all 
that is needed is in there and will be working for version 1.4.0 of R.

I'm sorry about that, I tought I had documented this. I'll include a 
note.

Under OSX this problem does not occour.

 From 1.3.1 R will be partially scriptable via Apple Events. It is 
working but I didn't finished the code yet.

I remember. This was already a topic in Vienna. I think this is due 
to some very  old code in S which is used here.
It would be nice if we could get someone to think how the graphics 
could be ported to a Quartz model for the MacX version.

Thank you Guenter,

I'm almost finished with porting R to the MPW shell. This will be 
functioning for release 1.4 of R.

I'm sorry about that, I tought I had documented this. I'll include a 
note.

Under OSX this problem does not occour.

 From 1.3.1 R will be partially scriptable via Apple Events. It is 
working but I didn't finished the code yet.

I remember. This was already a topic in Vienna. I think this is due 
to some very  old code in S which is used here.
It would be nice if we could get someone to think how the graphics 
could be ported to a Quartz model for the MacX version.
