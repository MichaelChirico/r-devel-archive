Did you upgrade cpp in homebrew after the installation from R? Errors
like seem to happen when compiler versions / libraries don't match.

If yes, reinstall libjpeg and the cairo programs, and, maybe, even R.

Otherwise I would suggest to try the same in an R session from the
terminal and see if you have the error there - because I don't know how
well RStutio works together with homebrew installed R - doesn't RStudio
come with  it's own R installation?

Cheers,

Rainer

Message-ID: <55757F35.6090607@gmail.com>

I posted this to R-devel yesterday; from responses received, it appears
to be OSX-specific (maybe Mavericks-specific).

In an R session started from the terminal with R --vanilla, I see this:

> Sys.setlocale(locale="en_CA")
[1] "en_CA/en_CA/en_CA/C/en_CA/en_CA.UTF-8"
> "320" > "300"
[1] NA
> "320" > "300"
[1] TRUE

The first string comparison after the locale change produces NA, while
later ones are fine.

The locale string "en_CA" doesn't appear to matter, as long as it is
different from my previous locale.

Do others see this?  Can we fix it before the 3.2.1 release?

I see it too on Mavericks (local build), going back to 

R Under development (unstable) (2015-03-17 r67996) -- "Unsuffered Consequences"

and it is even in the CRAN version (Mavericks build, I think - x86_64-apple-darwin13.1.0 (64-bit))

R version 3.1.1 (2014-07-10) -- "Sock it to Me"

Interesting - it seems to fail only the first time after the locale is set:

> Sys.setlocale(locale="en_CA")
[1] "en_CA/en_CA/en_CA/C/en_CA/en_US.UTF-8"
> "320" > "300"
[1] NA
> "320" > "300"
[1] TRUE
> "320" > "300"
[1] TRUE

There is probably an associated error. I'll have a look later today unless someone beats me to it.

Thanks,
Simon

Even when I set the locale to the same it is, I observe this error.

I've been looking at the Sys.setlocale source.  It resets the collator.
 When the collator is renewed during the comparison, errno is set to 2,
and that results in an NA value for the comparison.

The particular call that sets errno is ucol_open, in Scollate in
src/main/util.c.  The string comparison function in src/main/relop.c
sets errno to 0, then does the comparison, but errno ends up equal to 2
at the end.  Looks easy to fix.

I think I've got it, and should be able to commit a patch soon.

Duncan,

Would you (or someone) be able to test if this fixes a problem I found on
Friday, that appeared shortly after I upgraded to 3.2.0 and reinstalled
all my packages?


--------------------- example ---------------------
[62]% R --vanilla

R version 3.2.0 (2015-04-16) -- "Full of Ingredients"

[... startup messages omitted ...]

tmp.locale <- Sys.setlocale('LC_ALL','en_US.UTF-8')
require(xlsx)
Loading required package: xlsx
Failed with error:  ?


sessionInfo()
R version 3.2.0 (2015-04-16)
Platform: x86_64-apple-darwin13.4.0 (64-bit)
Running under: OS X 10.9.5 (Mavericks)

locale:
[1] en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/C/en_US.UTF-8/C

attached base packages:
[1] stats     graphics  grDevices utils     datasets  methods   base
--------------------- end of example ---------------------

Wheres if I load the package first, no problem.


I reported it to the maintainer (Adrian Dragulescu) at that time, and he
suggested that perhaps it was related. Earlier today I found the same
pattern with respect to the xtable package.

I apologize for not being in a position to do this test myself, but I'm
not set up to readily build R from source on the Mac.

Thanks
-Don

I can't test it, but it appears likely it would be related.  You should
be able to test it tomorrow.  I've added some inline comments to explain
why I think it's related.

This resets the string comparison code.  Currently the comparisons are
done relative to a locale, but the code to do that isn't initialized
until first use.

> require(xlsx)

This does a string comparison when it tries to figure out whether to
give a warning that the package was built under an obsolete version of
R.  That's the first string comparison after the locale change, and the
bug means it would return NA.  The problem was that the initialization
of the string comparison code set an irrelevant error code, and it
wasn't cleared, so the comparison code assumed an error occurred during
the comparison.


> Loading required package: xlsx
> Failed with error:  ?

Not sure why you didn't get a more informative error message.  I guess
that's another bug, but it's not one I'm going to look into:  I've got a
talk to prepare...

In that case the string comparison works, so the package loads.  There
was probably an incorrect computation later when the string comparison
failed, but apparently that one was less serious.

There should be nightly builds available tomorrow.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Install RNetCDF_1.7-3.tar.gz
Message-ID: <557AE522.6070607@yahoo.fr>

Dear list members,

RNetCDF_1.7-3 binaries are not available for OS X Mavericks, so I try 
install it from sources.

1- Using MacPorts, I installed netcdf, hdf5, udunits and udunits2 
libraries. It seems that they are correctly installed with the lastest 
version:

belinda:~ marc$ port installed

hdf5 @1.8.15-patch1_0+cxx (active)
netcdf @4.3.3.1_2+dap+netcdf4 (active)
udunits @1.12.11_2 (active)
udunits2 @2.1.24_0 (active)

2- in my .profile, I introduce this line:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/local:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

And it seems to work correctly:

belinda:~ marc$ echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH
/opt/local:


3- Then I load RNetCDF_1.7-3.tar.gz in the desktop and I run this command:

R CMD INSTALL 
--configure-args="--with-netcdf-include='/opt/local/include' 
--with-netcdf-lib='/opt/local/lib' 
--with-udunits-include='/opt/local/include' 
--with-udunits-lib='/opt/local/lib' --with-hdf5-lib='/opt/local/lib'" 
/Users/marc/Desktop/RNetCDF_1.7-3.tar.gz

4- But I obtain this error (the list of all outputs is shown below. Here 
I show only the error:

clang -dynamiclib -Wl,-headerpad_max_install_names -undefined 
dynamic_lookup -single_module -multiply_defined suppress 
-L/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/lib -L/usr/local/lib -o

-lz -ldl -lm -F/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/.. -framework R 
-Wl,-framework -Wl,CoreFoundation
ld: library not found for -lnetcdf

Does someone have an idea of the mistake(s) I did ?


Thanks a lot

Marc

R 3.2.0
OS X

Colleagues

I received unexpected output from a command issued in a terminal window:

> dput(CI)
c(82.9888290534313, 100.544763749464)

> round(dput(CI), 2)

[1]  82.98999999999999 100.54000000000001

I expected the result of the second command to be:
	82.99   100.54

Interesting, the problem also occurs if I round to 5 or 8 digits.  

Of note, the problem does NOT occur in R GUI or in Windows.

I am aware of FAQ 7.31 (Why doesn?t R think these numbers are equal?) but I don?t see how this could be manifestation of that issue.

I am curious as to the explanation of this issue.

If you set options(digits=16) you'll get it.  It's just FAQ 7.31, and
the fact that R only stores 15 or 16 digit accuracy.

There was no error either with using help() or using the Mac GUI package manager. Those were the reported difficulties previously reported.

 The error I am getting was from the most recent R 3.2.0 downloaded yesterday. There is no 3.2.0-Patched for Mavericks.  The release candidate, R 3.2.1 RC, is marked on the ATT Research webpage as failing Make and it indeed fails to launch. I would NOT recommend that anyone accept that advice. 

But maybe it is a Mac-specific problem. When I remove the crippled R 3.2.1 RC and reinstall the R 3.2.0 and run from a Terminal window I do not get the help.search() error. So copying to R SIG Mac, and will not copy R-help on any further efforts.

Posting the session Info when running in the GUI

Error in help(db[i, "topic"], package = db[i, "Package"], lib.loc = lib,  :

R version 3.2.0 (2015-04-16)
Platform: x86_64-apple-darwin13.4.0 (64-bit)
Running under: OS X 10.10.3 (Yosemite)

locale:

I had earlier tried following the code of help.search and its call to help by reading the code and running trace but was not able to find where the arguments of help.search had been renamed as ?topic?.

Then running in the Terminal window does not provoke the error.

I had earlier noted that the crash report for the launch of R 3.2.1 from the R.app (GUI) indicated that the directory that the GUI was attempting to load R from was incorrectly specified as: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.3/Resources/

Running R-3.2.1 RC on Yosemite 10.10.3 Mavericks version

Result of sessionInfo():

R version 3.2.1 RC (2015-06-10 r68503)
Platform: x86_64-apple-darwin13.4.0 (64-bit)
Running under: OS X 10.10.3 (Yosemite)

locale:
[1] en_GB.UTF-8/en_GB.UTF-8/en_GB.UTF-8/C/en_GB.UTF-8/en_GB.UTF-8

attached base packages:
[1] stats     graphics  grDevices utils     datasets  methods   base     

loaded via a namespace (and not attached):
[1] tools_3.2.1

and issuing the command

help.search(?linear models?) 

works perfectly ok.
On the page http://r.research.att.com: for R-3.2-branch  the R 3.2.1 RC did not fail make.
The development version of R failed.
And my R 3.2.1 of a few days ago has no problem with the help.search() function.

We seem to be talking past each other. The failure I am seeing for 3.2.0 is in the R.app sessions. Not seeing error in a Terminal session.

This is what I see (today) at the att.research site:
============
R-devel
3.2.1 RC
(2015/06/10, r68509)	mavericks	Jun 14 00:39	x86_64: make FAILED  (log)
Package: OK

R-devel-mavericks-sa-x86_64.tar.gz (59Mb)

R-devel-mavericks-signed.pkg (69Mb, installer incl. GUI)
=============

The failure I described for version 3.2.1 RC  was the GUI that was failing to launch which I thought might be related to the att.research note "x86_64: make FAILED (log)", but this line from the log link following the notation FAILED:

It says R-devel version 3.2.1 RC. Development version.
Wouldn?t/Shouldn't that be 3.3.0  especially since it is trying to find resources for 3.3.0?

I?m using R-3.2-branch: version 3.2.1 RC.
which is the upcoming R 3.2.1 AFAICT and I have assumed.

Yes, that is the way it is supposed to work. 3-2-branch moves through the sequence 

3.2.0 alpha
3.2.0 beta
3.2.0 RC
3.2.0 
3.2.0 Patched
3.2.1 beta
3.2.1 RC
3.2.1
3.2.1 Patched
<etc>

whereas R-devel should stick at

3.3.0 Under development (unstable)

until it is time for 3-3-branch, at which point it changes to 3.4.0 Under development, etc.

How R-devel ended up listing as 3.2.1 RC is hard to tell, but presumably it is a local error at r.research.att.com (there seems to be no issue with the present sources in SVN).

Notice that 3.2.0 Patched disappears when 3.2.1 prereleases start. There seems to be no backlog of builds of 3.2.0 Patched, but there would be little point in looking for one. 3.2.1 is really just a formal release of patches-to-date.

Note that the build failed - this means that there is no actual way to determine the version (since R can't be run). I think what happens is that the currently installed version is then reported which is whatever did succeed last - in this case 3.2.1 RC. The bug here is that nothing (other that the error) should have been reported.

Cheers,
Simon

OK, that explains it.

(However, `cat VERSION` should work whether or not the build succeeds).

In the confusion about which build is which I hope it's not forgotten that the problem started with ver 3.2.0's help.search function throwing an unexpected error when run in the R.app environment.

Yes, but the suggestion was that the issue had gone away in current R-3-2-branch versions (never mind the current name), so had it? (I'd rather not check it for you because I'm superstitious about upsetting the build machine so close to release.)

Yes, that has been long fixed:


Last-update: 2015-04-20
*       fix HTTP help startup to use new R 3.2.0 API

*       adapt to changed variable names in hsearch$match

This is on a machine where I obtained the R/GUI package installer on Saturday for the express purpose of attempting (and succeeding) in replicating the report I saw in Rhelp.

^^ but that's old! Please test with the current RC - it's pointless to report things on old releases that have been fixed since ... I really don't know how else we can make this more simple - we have nightly builds as easy to install as the releases and still people don't bother testing them until it's too late :(

Well, it's what I got 2 days ago from http://r.research.att.com/

I went to your site on Saturday. Downloaded the available Mavericks releases. Both of them. One threw the error. One simply failed to load.

http://r.research.att.com/mavericks/R-3.2-branch/R-3.2-branch-mavericks-signed.pkg is different that what I got  2 days ago. Yes. the error is corrected.

Well, we don't change released versions retroactively.

R 3.2.0 is R 3.2.0. If there's a bug in 3.2.0, there's a bug in 3.2.0 and there will continue to be a bug in 3.2.0. If we fix it, the fixed version will be something other than 3.2.0.

(Actually, we could conceiveably distribute and modify R.app and other shell applications out of sync with R itself, but that is not what we do.)

The bug is (or was)  in the interaction with the GUI. Not in R 3.2.0.

But the GUI *is* part of the R 3.2.0 release so, yes, it was a bug in R 3.2.0.

You can always fetch either the GUI or R from the nightly pages. Since you knew it's the GUI, you could simply take the updated GUI from there. But if that doesn't fix it, you still have to get the full R since it may be an interaction of both.

All am I asking is for people to test the betas/RCs since we typically get reports only after the release which is simply too late to do anything about it.

Cheers,
Simon

Perhaps the latest R-patched should also be published at
http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/, just to make it more
discoverable + encourage its use by more users? (In other words --
should users be encouraged to run R 3.2.0-patched instead of R-3.2.0?
If so, the 'patched' link should be advertised more strongly than R
3.2.0, in my opinion).

The http://r.research.att.com/ page is 'scary' for new users -- since
it's a different page, with different styling, and the big
'experimental' caveat (ie -- don't blame us if it blows up your
computer) so I think this dissuades a lot of users from testing. In
particular, that text seems to give the connotation that even
R-patched is also 'dangerous'; I don't think that's true and so that
ends up scaring more potential users off.

Also, is there any reason for displaying a download link for the GUI
sources as well? I imagine the overlap between users downloading R
binaries and users downloading R GUI sources is pretty small; at best
I think it confuse new users (wait, so if I want to install R with a
GUI, do I need to download both? What are 'sources', anyway?)

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] R.app Packages file to load: Cannot find library objects
Message-ID: <06139809-0671-42E0-8FB1-8DABF0B40BBE@greatergood.com>

Hello,

I?m having a problem with R 3.2 on the Mac under R.app, and the Internets have failed to provide an answer, so I was wondering if there might be someone here that can help me.

Whenever I try to load a package I get the following error:

> library(dplyr)
Error in dyn.load(file, DLLpath = DLLpath, ...) : 
  unable to load shared object '/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/PackageLib/dplyr/libs/dplyr.so':
  dlopen(/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/PackageLib/dplyr/libs/dplyr.so, 6): Library not loaded: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.1/Resources/lib/libR.dylib
  Referenced from: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/PackageLib/dplyr/libs/dplyr.so
  Reason: image not found
Error: package or namespace load failed for ?dplyr?

(1)	The specific library referenced in the dlopen() function may differ ? here it is libR.dylib, but for markovchain it?s libgfortran.

(2)	I?m running (just installed) R 3.2.1 World Famous Astronaut, but this happened with 3.2.0 as well;
		Mac OS 10.10.3
		32 GB Core

(3)	This only happens using R.app.  Everything works fine when I fire up R in R-Studio or at the command line.

(4)	I have noted that it seems to be trying to access the 3.1 Resources.  There are some 3.1 things out in /Library/Frameworks/R.framework, but all the major directories, particularly those that are links, appear to be pointing to 3.2.  I don?t know how to tell R.app that we?ve moved on in life and need to be looking in the new neighborhood.


Thanks,

?Gregory

If you installed the frameworks version of R 3.2, then R should be looking for the package library in 

   /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.2/Resources/

How did you migrate you packages to 3.2. The usual method is to make copies and move them to the 3.2 .../library/ directory and then execute:

   update.packages(checkBuilt-TRUE, # and I usually need to do this because I have a lot of packages
                   ask=FALSE)  # the default is TRUE

What does this show?

   .libPaths()

It should show at least this:

1] "/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.2/Resources/library"

... but if you have a User/.../library then that will also appear

Thank you, David, executing the update.packages() command seems to have cured it.

This was perplexing because it only failed in the R.app, and not in R Studio or the command line R ? since I mainly use R Studio, I didn?t really notice the R.app behavior.

Hi R-Mac,
I got trouble about installation of some library which might use C/C++/Fortran code. 
Rmetrics-fPortfolio and RQuantlib are such case.
How to figure out this issue ?
thanks a lot.


below is my error message from RStudio.

You need to install symphony first.

I used brew install R to install R and I use the most recent version of

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Problems updating RCurl on Yosemite
Message-ID: <DB845001-C777-4D89-B39A-F7293E8E36BA@gmail.com>

Hello all

I have R 3.1.0 installed on my computer, and at some point in the past had successfully installed RCurl (1.95-4.3). However, I am now unable to update RCurl, and in spite of my best efforts at googling, I can?t seem to get things working.

The error I receive is

Error in dyn.load(file, DLLpath = DLLpath, ...) :
  unable to load shared object '/usr/local/Cellar/r/3.1.0/R.framework/Versions/3.1/Resources/library/RCurl/libs/RCurl.so':
  dlopen(/usr/local/Cellar/r/3.1.0/R.framework/Versions/3.1/Resources/library/RCurl/libs/RCurl.so, 6): Library not loaded: libcurl.4.dylib
  Referenced from: /usr/local/Cellar/r/3.1.0/R.framework/Versions/3.1/Resources/library/RCurl/libs/RCurl.so
  Reason: image not found

It seems likely that R is looking to the system curl:

$ which curl
/usr/bin/curl
$ curl --version
curl 7.37.1 (x86_64-apple-darwin14.0) libcurl/7.37.1 SecureTransport zlib/1.2.5
Protocols: dict file ftp ftps gopher http https imap imaps ldap ldaps pop3 pop3s rtsp smtp smtps telnet tftp
Features: AsynchDNS GSS-Negotiate IPv6 Largefile NTLM NTLM_WB SSL libz

I have tried installing curl from Homebrew (version 7.42.1) and setting LDFLAGS and CPPFLAGS (and LIBCURL_CFLAGS and LIBCURL_LIBS) to point to this version of curl, to no avail.

I?m unsure if there is a way to set these build flags from within R; is that a possible fix? Thank you for any advice you can offer!

Best
Henry

I answer myself to my question just in case someone will search for the 
same problem; he/she will find the solution !
The problem is seen only if MacPorts is used. If the library in 
installed in other way, it works.
The complete solution has been posted here:

Sincerely,

Marc
