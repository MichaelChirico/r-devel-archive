Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] graphics to clipboard
Message-ID: <CF449AB3-1151-459C-A041-3CC9B7FBDAAC@mac.com>

Hi,

I would like to export a plot from R by copying it as a pdf to the  
clipboard (in OS X), while running in batch mode.  The idea would be  
to wrap R's graphing capabilities in a simple GUI, which would grab  
the result from the clipboard and display it in an NSView.  I could  
use a temporary file on disk, but that seems not so elegant.

Thanks,

Tom Elliott

Great. So what is the question? There are many ways to do this. Which  
device do you plan to use and which of the steps are you stuck at?  
I'd suggest ?pipe, ?pdf, ?Cairo, ?quartz ... As of temporary files,  
most methods involve temporary files on the R side anyway (except for  
Cairo+patched R) and if you want a NSView then it's probably easiest  
to get it right away from Quartz - no need to create pdf at all.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] editor glyph generation of brackets
Message-ID: <529D168D-B4EE-40D6-97F3-03C9B3A92F14@sbg.ac.at>

Hi all!

I regularly get errors when automatic glyph generation
for brackets is performed by the editor.

I don't know what could be the trigger,
as the error arises unpredictably during editing the script
when inserting [], () or {}.

Normal behaviour is restored when reopening the file,
but the errors are likely to come up again.

I'm irritated since a long time
and so I will appreciate any advice.

I know that using another editor will cure the problem,
but I really like the built-in one!


Cheers,

Roland

Roland,

you're using an outdated version of R and the GUI - please update at  
least to the latest GUI version and report only if it still persists,  
the brace matching was improved quite a bit since.

Thanks,
Simon

Nathan,

[I thought I responded, but I don't see it on the list, so sorry if  
this is a duplicate]

the version of your GUI and R don't match. You're using an outdated  
GUI version that was designed for earlier R versions. Please make  
sure you install the GUI version that comes with the R you use or,  
even better, get the latest GUI version for your particular R version  
from http://r.research.att.com/

Cheers,
Simon

Hi Simon!

Everything went fine for a while!
Brackets didn't come up with any errors.

But an error occured when typing "".

Sorry I can't give any reproducible example.

I hope this helps!

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Raising the Index page for a package in Mac R Help
	window
Message-ID: <0BE438149FF2254DB4199E2682C8DFEB0328A028@crcmail1.BCCRC.CA>

Hi all,

Is it possible to raise the "Index" page 
for a given package, in the Apple R GUI 
R Help window (not the HTML - web browser
help interface)?

For example, if I load library(lme4)
I'd like to be able to raise the lme4
Index page in the R Help window that
accompanies the R GUI window on the Mac.

Currently I have to know the name of a function,
say "lmer", or find the name of a package function by
looking through the list of functions (typically in 
position 2 on the search path after loading a library), 
then

> ?lmer

raises the lmer help page, and I scroll to the
bottom where I see

[Package lme4 version 0.99875-7 Index]

and I click on the "Index" hyperlink.


It would be great to be able to enter

> ?lme4

and go straight to the lme4 help Index page.  

Is this possible?  (I haven't found this in any documentation.)

If not, could I put in a request
for this feature?

Try making the list of packages into a character vector:

install.packages(c('car','Hmisc','doBy','lme4','gmodels','gplots','gdata'))

Does that work for you?

Good point. My error.

But there are packages that won't install even if I install them one  
by one. Hmisc is an example.

More importantly:

1. what caused R's amnesia about all of my non-default packages upon  
upgrade?

2. why didn't
update.packages(checkBuilt=TRUE, ask=FALSE)
work?

Can you be more specific, please? (i.e. what error message do you get?)

The 'amnesia' depends on where you installed them. The system-wide  
location is always version-dependent, the custom locations may or may  
not be version-dependent - check your .libPaths(). Packages are  
dependent on the R version used, so when upgrading from 2.5.x to  
2.6.x you have to re-install them anyway. The GUI provides an easy  
way to upgrade package from previous R versions even if R cannot see  
them (Package Installer: Get List, then click on the magnifying glass  
in the search field and "Select Packages from R 2.5", then Install  
Selected).

Can you be more specific? As I understand it you had no old packages,  
so it was working ...

Simon

Thank you Gerald,

This works very well.  I hadn't seen this
feature as I've been managing packages at the
command line or from a shell.

"Packages and Data" - "Package Manager" raises
the R Package Manager gui, which has two panels
(you might not see one of them if the slider
is fully at the top or bottom of the window)
Selecting a package in the top panel invokes
the Index page of help for the selected package,
close enough to what I was looking for.

The feature I enquired about is already in place,
thanks to Simon Urbanek and the others who have
done such a great job with the Mac R.app

Steven,

You could use the GUI feature "Packages and Data" (could be a  
slightly different naming, but i only have a german interface). When  
you choose the menu item Package Management you can choose packages  
to load. In the moment you check the box for a package the index page  
appears in the lower panel of the window.. You may have to open the  
lower panel by dragging the slider..

Your approach works if the package maintainer has prepared it..

hi,

i've a problem to load posgresql library into r.app


r.app fail to install rdbipgsql
beacouse it do not find the pgsql environment.
so i installed it from command line using :

wget http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/2.0/bioc/src/contrib/ 
RdbiPgSQL_1.10.0.tar.gz

R CMD install --configure-args='--with-pgsql-libraries=/usr/local/ 
pgsql/lib/ --with-pgsql-includes=/usr/local/pgsql/include/' /Users/ 
epifanio/RdbiPgSQL_1.10.0.tar.gz

now library(RdbiPgSQL)
is loaded correctly using R from bash

but tring to load it from r.app
i get this message :

 > library(RdbiPgSQL)
Carico il pacchetto richiesto: Rdbi
Error in dyn.load(x, as.logical(local), as.logical(now)) :
	impossibile caricare libreria condivisa '/Users/epifanio/Library/R/

mybe this was caused from my errors
just for note,  in the past i tried to install the postgrees package
at user level instead of R framework
from a binary package availabe here :

http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/unixport/postgres

maybe i do not followed the right procedure ... and this generate my  
problem...

thanks for any suggestion!

Massimo.

John,

there seems to be a problem with the paths in the PowerPC part of the  
binary, I'll look into this.
In the meantime the work-around is to install the full R (including  
GNU Fortran), not just the mini package.

Cheers,
Simon

Problem found (it was really just the stats.so for PowerPC machines)  
and fixed (please test the pre-releases!). The CRAN binary was  
updated (check the MD5 sum to see if you have the correct one, it  
should be ff218b4e5687077c0078ca4948be1205) and should propagate to  
all mirrors tomorrow.

Again, a hotfix in the meantime is to make sure that you have GNU  
Fortran installed - either from the full R release or from
http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools/

Cheers,
Simon

Message-ID: <BFA58A69-BC5A-49AE-82E5-935C3A617C36@stat.berkeley.edu>

The full version of R-2.6.0 from CRAN says "gfortran version 4.2.0"  
in the installer (when you press "customize"). It should be version  
4.2.1 (as it also says during the installation).

Not sure if it is worthwhile to fix this.

I can't see Hmisc in the CRAN (binaries) list in the Package Installer 
either, although it's there in the CRAN (sources) list. I downloaded the 
OS X binary directly from 
http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/universal/contrib/r-release/Hmisc_3.4-2.tgz
and that installed fine.

Olaf,

the packages are available from the main CRAN server (both via  
install.packages() and the Package Installer), so it is probably a  
problem with the mirror you use. Please always try the main server  
when having problems with the package availability.

Thanks,
Simon

parametric3d isn't in rgl, it's in misc3d, but this does look like it 
might be an rgl problem.  Unfortunately I can't duplicate it on Windows. 
  I'll take a look on MacOSX tonight.

I don't see this in R.app 2.6.0 with those versions of misc3d and rgl, 
so all I can suggest is that you upgrade to the current release.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Viewing Multiple Pages of Plot
Message-ID: <p06110402c33367e74638@[192.168.1.101]>

Dear Members/Readers:

I have searched the web & this site for the answer to a questions 
without luck and wondered if someone out there could please help.  I 
am plotting in R (2.5.1)from a package (Xpose4) on an Intel Mac.  The 
plot images appear in the Quartz window as expected, except when 
there are so many sub-plots that they must be placed on multiple 
pages.  All but the last page of plots flashes on the Quartz window, 
and the last page remains.  I can't figure out how to access those 
first several pages.  In Windows, I would use the fn+up or down 
scroll keys, but that doesn't work here.

If you have any clues, I'd greatly appreciate it.  Please keep in 
mind I am not using the command line, though if that is the only way 
to address the problem, I'd be interested in the answer anyway. 
Thanks in advance.

Nancy

Hi,

We are gradually moving most of climate data and model 
output analyses to R. We have a 2 x Core 2 Duo Mac with 9GB 
memory and 3TB disk space, i.e. ideal for such work...

Question: Does the standard (binary distribution) of R use 
all of the cores and access all of the available memory?

Or does one have to recompile R to take advantages of more 
powerful hardware available around?

R will use the available memory, but keep in mind that MacOS is still a
32-bit operating system, so 9 Gb of RAM won't be used, I don't think.  R
will use only one processor unless you write code specifically using
mechanisms like Rmpi OR if you simply run multiple R processes
simultaneously.  Recompiling will not change that.

The CRAN binary is a 32-bit build, so it will use only up to 4GB of  
RAM per process. An unofficial 64-bit binary of R is available from  
the R for Mac developer page, but CRAN doesn't provide binary  
packages for that build.
However, the CRAN build supports vecLib, and as such it will use all  
four cores for matrix operations that are supported by LAPACK.

You don't have to, but you can compile 64-bit version of R if you  
need more RAM in one R process (you can still use all 9GB of RAM when  
using parallel R processes, c.f. snow). In Tiger the 64-bit version  
of R is somewhat limited compared to the 32-bit version, because most  
system libraries are not available in 64-bit, however Leopard  
supports full 64-bit build including the GUI. We will release a  
corresponding binary in due course.

Cheers,
Simon

Yes, you seem to be mixing R versions when compiling your code. I  
suspect that you have an older R on your PATH so you are compiling  
for the wrong version of R. Please double-check your R versions. If  
the problem persists, please post the full output of the compilation  
and the result of otool -L test.so

Cheers,
Simon

Quartz has (currently) no provision for displaying multiple pages.  
You should be able to use par(ask=TRUE) to pause between pages.

Hi Nancy,

The way I do this is to print out my plots to pdf's - each new plot
will be on a new page. So I mess around with a single plot until I
like it and move to the next. Once they're all good, I do something
like:

pdf('MyGraphs.pdf',width=11, height=8.5,pointsize=12, paper='special')

<graphing syntax>

dev.off()

Dear Mailing list, Enrico, Simon,

After installing to R.2.6, I got the same exact problem when installed 
the SNPassoc package; it seemed to be looking for 2.5 (

I ended up uninstallling R and reinstalling it from scratch; now it's 
working.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Problem building R-devel (2.7.0)
Message-ID: <470F7369.3010409@postgrad.manchester.ac.uk>

Hi

I can't seem to build the latest development version on my MacBook Pro. 
I'm using the following commands:

tar xvfz R-devel.tar.gz
cd R-devel
./configure --with-blas='-framework vecLib' --with-lapack --with-aqua 
--enable-R-framework
make

I get the following errors before make quits:

making devQuartz.d from devQuartz.c
devQuartz.c:35:32: error: R_ext/QuartzDevice.h: No such file or directory
make[4]: *** [devQuartz.d] Error 1
make[3]: *** [all] Error 1
make[2]: *** [R] Error 1
make[1]: *** [R] Error 1
make: *** [R] Error 1

Anyone know what the problem might be? Am I doing something wrong or is 
there a bug somewhere? I've installed the same devel source on my linux 
box without problems.

Many thanks

Richard.

Yes, QuartzDevice.h is available only in the SVN checkout, not in the  
tar ball. Thanks, I have fixed it (for tomorrow's tar).

For anyone else facing this issue,
I see that <Ctrl>-mouseclick
in the help documentation lower pane
raises a pop-up menu with back
and forward menu items, so one can
navigate via that mechanism until the
upper '<Back' and 'Forward>' buttons
are activated.

When I am using the lower pane of the R.app Package Manager
window to view help, the browser <Back and
Forward> buttons are always greyed out.  Should
these buttons work like the back and forward buttons
in the R.app Help window, allowing navigation
backwards and forwards through the help topics selected

Message-ID: <C33BD3A8.2D326%tjohnson@src.riken.jp>

After upgrading to R 2.6.0, I tried saving the Quartz window to a file from
R.app using quartz.save() as mentioned in the R for Mac FAQ, but received
the error message:

Error: could not find function "quartz.save"

I've recreated this error on both a Mac Pro and a G4 PowerBook.

Reinstalling R 2.5.1 over the top removes the error.

This is the simple code to recreate the bug:

quartz(width=5, height=5);
plot(c(0,0));
quartz.save("/Users/MyUserName/Desktop/test2.pdf");


Best,

Michael,

your Graphviz-dev setup seems to be broken - look at your "Fount  
graphiviz..." output.
Just out of curiosity - is the BioC binary of Rgraphviz not working  
for you?

Cheers,
Simon

Indeed, a bug was introduced when removing some of the legacy fixes  
that were part of the tools:RGUI environment, thanks for the report.  
This should be now fixed in the SVN, so please try tomorrow's nightly  
build of the GUI.

A hot fix in the meantime is to paste this in the GUI:

local({e<-attach(NULL,name="tools:RGUI"); assign 
("quartz.save",function(file, type="png", device=dev.cur(), ...)  
invisible(.Call("QuartzSaveContents",device,file,type,list(...))),e)})

Cheers,
Simon

Unfortunately email mangling can leave this command in a state
not conducive to cut-and-paste

I hope this version is a little more robust
to email mangling.


local({e <- attach(NULL, name = "tools:RGUI");
       assign("quartz.save",
              function(file, type = "png",
                       device = dev.cur(), ...){
                invisible(.Call("QuartzSaveContents",
                                device, file, type,
                                list(...)))}, e)})

Tested in R.app 
R 2.6.0 GUI 1.21 (4815) (4815)
on Mac OS X 10.4.10

Hi,

The following code is taken from the R web-site (i have checked, and  
this does run on windows), and tried using it in R.app and I get an  
error message regarding an 'unknown color name systemWindowBody'. I  
have tried changing the color value to cyan, blue, etc and nothing  
seems to work.

Error in structure(.External("dotTclObjv", objv, PACKAGE = "tcltk"),  
class = "tclObj") :

I have been googling around and whilst this error is common I have  
yet to find a clear answer (I am new to tcl/tk).

Any help would be gratefully appreciated.

Kind regards,

Sam.

You might search the R-Sig-gui group



I found some similar discussion there to your problem



Here is a thread.

Hi

I saw a couple of posts mentioning a solution for using R in Leopard.  
Seems like the command line R still works, but the GUI is down for the  
count. Is there an experimental package anywhere?

Thanks

The GUI works just fine for me. Actually the X11 part of R also
works from the GUI, although Leopard X11 is broken in places and
has a very different startup procedure. I also managed to (finally)
compile rgl by patching LDFLAGS. From the command line, there are
problems with starting X11.

Let me download the R binary and see what happens for me.

Hmmm, the mpkg seems broken. I can't pick anything to install. The  
mpkg installer starts in "Custom Install" mode, and with all the  
packages greyed-out so they cannot be installed. Standard mode lists  
nothing to install.

I installed each pkg individually, and it works fine. Even tcltk is  
working well with the massively overhauled X11. I just installed Rcmdr  
and all its dependencies, and things worked fine.

Cheers,
John Tull

Hi all,

I was able to install the release build via the individual package
files (not the .mpkg, which had all of the individual packages
unchecked and non-modifiable), but building packages from source seems
to be broken.

I get the following error trying to build Rstem:

ld: library not found for -ldylib1.10.5.o

which I think is due to the compile flag "-isysroot
/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk" being incorrect on Leopard systems (
if I've read the documentation correctly, the location should now be
"/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk/usr/lib" )

I'm new enough to R that I'm not sure where these flags are stored,
otherwise I'd try to change the build command myself to see if that
fixes the error.

cheers,
-don

Current status of R and Leopard:

I don't have the release version of Leopard yet (waiting for the  
DVD...), so the information below is based on tests using the latest  
seed and user responses (see the list) in the last few days.

* Building R
This was our priority and we have smoothed all the wrinkles as far as  
I can see. Building current R from sources on Leopard works just  
fine. You can build both R and the GUI in 32 and 64-bit, leveraging  
the new 64-bit Cocoa support. You can create a quad-arch framework  
including the GUI if you wish, such R runs on both PowerPC and Intel  
Macs in both 32-bit and 64-bit mode. The r_arch names must be i386,  
ppc, x86_64 and ppc64 for the framework to install correctly.

* Using CRAN Tiger R on Leopard
Apparently there is a problem with the installer. Although our  
installer requires my.target.systemVersion.ProductVersion >= '10.4'  
and as such should work with Leopard, the Apple installer apparently  
breaks this. This is under investigation. Current work-around is to  
install R parts separately from the "Packages" directory of the R image.

Building packages from *sources* reportedly breaks due to some issue  
with Xcode. I can't test this with the release, but a hotfix could be  
adding -mmacosx-version-min=10.4 to linker flags either to PKG_LIBS  
or /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/etc/i386/Makeconf.  
(untested)

Binary packages are fine, so if you can, use CRAN binaries instead.

I have a working nightly build of R on Leopard that supports both  
Tiger and Leopard, but since I'm using the pre-release I cannot make  
it public until I get the release license. Once I get it, the nightly  
builds should work smoothly on both Tiger and Leopard.

We have some Leopard-specific aces up our sleeves, there will be a  
completely new Leopard build of R with cool new features,  
graphics, ... stay tuned ...

Cheers,
Simon

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] some suggestions for building R on leopard
Message-ID: <d2d597140710302017t6195a05q74ef010b7254a45@mail.gmail.com>

upgrading to leopard seems to cause a couple of problems for R, and
while I'm sure the R for OS X developers will come up with better
solutions soon, in the meantime I thought I'd post my current
work-around, hopefully someone out there might find it useful, and/or
be able to fill in a couple gaps.

1) The latest patched framework build and GUI from
http://r.research.att.com/ seem to work ok in leopard.  One comment on
this:  apple's made some major changes to the X11 server in leopard.
a lot of people are saying the new x11 is "broken", but I've also read
that the new x11 is based on a more modern codebase.  so maybe it's
not worth deleting.  anyway, one major difference is that you no
longer need to open X11.app manually prior to opening a plotting
window if you are running R from the command line.  Also, it is no
longer necessary to manually set the environment variable DISPLAY=:0.0
in a .bashrc for example.  After removing this line from my .bashrc
(and reopening terminal),   the X11 plotting from the command line
worked.

2) Building shared objects using R CMD SHLIB doesn't work using the
pre-compiled builds mentioned above (maybe this is too technical for
this list, but it's relevant for mac users I think).  This often
happens when apple releases a new OS, due to the new operating system
moving around and renaming dynamic libraries.   However, due to the
changes to X11, compiling R from source in leopard doesn't seem to get
past the configure script unless you set with-x=no.  I haven't been
able to figure out any combination of arguments to configure that
doesn't result in:

configure: error: --with-x=yes (default) and X11 headers/libs are not available

But if you call configure as "configure --with-x=no", the makefiles
get properly generated, and I'm able to build a version of R that is
able to successfully compile shared objects.  Command line R isn't
able to open X11 plotting windows, however gui R is still able to open
aqua plotting windows, so the build is pretty functional I think.

If anybody knows how to call configure to avoid this error, I'm all
ears.  I'm pretty sure the X11 headers are now in
/usr/X11/include/X11/ and the libraries are still in /usr/X11/lib/.
Specifically, calling configure as:

configure --with-blas='-framework vecLib'
--x-libraries='-L/usr/X11/lib' --x-includes='-I/usr/X11/include/X11'

seems to get further than anything else I've tried, but once it gets
to the X11 checks it dies with:

checking for X... libraries -L/usr/X11/lib, headers -I/usr/X11/include/X11
checking for dnet_ntoa in -ldnet... no
checking for dnet_ntoa in -ldnet_stub... no
checking for gethostbyname... yes
checking for connect... yes
checking for remove... yes
checking for shmat... yes
checking for IceConnectionNumber in -lICE... no
checking X11/Intrinsic.h usability... yes
checking X11/Intrinsic.h presence... yes
checking for X11/Intrinsic.h... yes
checking for XtToolkitInitialize in -lXt... no
configure: error: --with-x=yes (default) and X11 headers/libs are not available


Any suggestions would be great.  My main point is that you can compile
R in leopard without X support, and get something that seems fully
functional through the GUI and is capable of building packages again.

Hello,

I have recently installed Leopard, Mac OS X 10.5. But I couldn't be able 
to install R using the installer. After accepting the terms and conditions 
I end up in custom install section with all the selections and the install 
button is dimmed. Is there a way that you can correct this? Or is there a 
way I can help you to create a installer for Leopard for the people to use 
it?

I had the same problem, found the tip on the R-SIG-Archives...

The .mpkg for the whole package (4 components) appears flawed.

Click on the <PACKAGES> folder on the main install window (where the main
.mpkg is shown) and this shows a subfolder with two separate packages, both
of which can be installed individually.

Hope this helps.../Rob

It would probably be a good idea for someone with a leopard box (I don't 
have one yet, sorry...) to go through the configure script, figure out why 
the XtToolkitInitialize test is failing, and report that back to the list 
(along with the location of the sought file on Leopard, if it exists...).

It is likely that the configure test just isn't smart enough to deal with 
a file location change, or something, on leopard.

[I run into this stuff all the time building Solaris apps.... a lot of 
configure scripts are just plain awful.]

This is a bit misleading - this has nothing to do with X11 per-se.  
What Apple did is something far more awful - they set DISPLAY by  
default to a special service that attempts to start X11 automatically  
when a connection is initiated. This is a matter of taste, but I must  
say that I'm not fond of that change, because I don't want X11 on by  
default (just remember the CRAN mirror selection - terrible in Tcl/Tk  
no keyboard interaction, but very easy to choose in the CL).  
Fortunately you can fix that in your startup scripts.

Please read my previous post on the list about R and Leopard, it has  
the fix. (For R CMD SHLIB it's as easy as PKG_LIBS=-mmacosx-version- 
min=10.4 R CMD SHLIB).

I works for me flawlessly (on the last seed). Are sure you have  
installed X11 and Xcode properly?
In any case please post the relevant parts of config.log (or send me  
the whole thing if you wish).

How can you fix this in startup scripts?

Thanks, this probably does work, but I didn't check it for the reason
below (I'm on the daily digest mailings so I had sent mine before
reading your post)

I have standard installations of X11, Xcode, and gfortran 4.2.1 from
your site.  I did upgrade my previous developer tools with the version
on the leopard dvd, possibly that is the cause?  Either way, I figured
out that calling configure as:

configure  --x-libraries='-L/usr/X11/lib' --x-includes='-I/usr/X11/include/X11'
X_LIBS=-L/usr/X11/lib

succeeds, and then the build can be completed with X11 support, and
the ability to build packages without specifying the PKG_LIBS variable
as you suggested.

To answer your other question, calling "configure" with no arguments
fails for inability to link the library Xt (from config.log:

configure:45035: gcc -std=gnu99 -o conftest -g -O2 -fPIC
-I/usr/local/include -no-cpp-precomp -L/usr/local/lib conftest.c -lXt
-lm  -liconv >&5
ld: library not found for -lXt
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status

)

Anyway, I certainly didn't move around any of the X11 libs or headers
since installing them.  Perhaps you have some symlinks or the X_LIBS
variable already set, either of which probably circumvent this
problem?

thanks again,
Dan

No, they are there to start with. I have tested both a fresh machine  
with the latest seed as well as a fresh Leopard release install and  
this is what I get in both cases:

ginaz:~$ ls -ld /usr/X11*
drwxr-xr-x  9 root  wheel  306 Oct 13 15:22 /usr/X11
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel    3 Oct 13 15:22 /usr/X11R6 -> X11

So the usual /usr/X11R6 prefix works. What have you got there and how  
did you install Leopard (fresh, archive or upgrade)?

Cheers,
Simon

I did a Leopard upgrade.  I agree that the /usr/X11/ and /usr/X11R6/
directories are there, they're there on my machine too.  I don't know
why configure can't find them without the help.

I am unclear on your meaning in the above statement. Is the  
"unofficial upgrade" to Xquartz for Leopard actually a downgrade to  
the Tiger version of X11 (xfree86 versus newer xorg)?

Perhaps a link to the forum so list readers can peruse the arguments  
being laid out on this issue. Personally, I would rather stick with  
the current xorg than revert to the xfree86 code, but I am not sure if  
that is what you are describing.

This also looks helpful, has a backreving procedure.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] R 2.6 64-bit leopard build problem
Message-ID: <070LJEsLc7884S19.1193854322@cmsweb19.cms.usa.net>

Dear all,

First, my apologies if I've double posted.

I'm having difficulty getting R 2.6 patched to build under Leopard as a 64-bit
application.

Configure works -- after many follies involving readline, libiconv, compilers,
etc.

R is now configured for x86_64-apple-darwin9.0.0

  Source directory:          .
  Installation directory:    /Library/Frameworks

  C compiler:                gcc -arch x86_64 -std=gnu99  -g -O3 -m64
-I/readline/include -L/readline/lib
  Fortran 77 compiler:       gfortran -arch x86_64  -g -O3 -m64
-I/readline/include -L/readline/lib

  C++ compiler:              g++ -arch x86_64  -g -O3 -m64 -I/readline/include
-L/readline/lib
  Fortran 90/95 compiler:    gfortran -arch x86_64 -g -O3 -m64
-I/readline/include -L/readline/lib
  Obj-C compiler:	     gcc -g -O2

  Interfaces supported:      X11, aqua, tcltk
  External libraries:        readline, BLAS(vecLib), LAPACK(in blas)
  Additional capabilities:   iconv, MBCS, NLS
  Options enabled:           framework, R profiling, Java

  Recommended packages:      yes

However, when it reaches grDevices in the make, it dies:
gcc -arch x86_64 -std=gnu99 -no-cpp-precomp -I../../../../include

Thank you for the tip. It has worked well. I've succesfully ran the R GUI 
and created a data set and got me a summary. Noting fancy, but it works.

Thanks again.

Dear all,

After much reading, frustration, and experimentation, I think I've nearly
gotten R 2.6 to compile in 64-bit mode for my Mac Pro.

It makes it through configure ok, which involved readline and libiconv
problems as well as some compiler choice issues.
