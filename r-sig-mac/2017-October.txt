Dear Robert,

The most common Rcmdr problem on macOS is failure to install XQuartz, which is required by the tcltk package. If you haven't installed XQuartz, then start there, and remember to reboot after the XQuartz installation: <https://www.xquartz.org/>. For more details, please see the Rcmdr installation notes for macOS at <http://socserv.socsci.mcmaster.ca/jfox/Misc/Rcmdr/installation-notes.html>. You should be able to use the Rcmdr from R.app, a terminal window, or RStudio.

On the other hand, if you *have* installed XQuartz and rebooted, and the problem still occurs, then see whether you can load and use the tcltk package directly, without the Rcmdr; try, e.g. (from ?TkWidgets),

	library(tcltk)
	tt <- tktoplevel()
	label.widget <- tklabel(tt, text = "Hello, World!")
	button.widget <- tkbutton(tt, text = "Push",command = function()cat("OW!\n"))
	tkpack(label.widget, button.widget)

Finally, your setup is very similar to mine -- that is, I haven't yet upgraded my Mac to R 3.4.2 (which I don't think is built yet for macOS) but all my R packages are up-to-date. An exception is that I haven't yet installed the latest version of Xcode, which I'll do now to see what happens. It's unclear to me from your message whether the Rcmdr package worked before you installed the newest Xcode.

I hope this helps,
 John

As soon as you "click" the override box the greyed out numbers should become black and you will be able to change their values.

I think the question is related to the font (in the lower half), not to the
width / height / DPI in the upper half of the dialog.
Just checked, and it is not related to R 3.4.1 since I still have R 3.3.3
and can observe the same thing.

I hope it helps,
Adrian

Dear Robert,

As a brief addendum to my previous message, I?ve now installed the newest
version of Xcode, and I still have no trouble using the Rcmdr package.

I did get the following message when I initially loaded the Rcmdr package:
?Agreeing to the Xcode/iOS license requires admin privileges, please run
?sudo xcodebuild -license? and then retry this command.? But the Rcmdr
loaded properly both before *and* after I followed the instruction in the
message.

Best,
 John

Adrian is correct: the bug is that the font box is always disabled.

my list of things I?d pay to get fixed includes:
1. Custom Clang throwing undefined exception instead of error message
2. No approved dmg installer for new toolchain.
3. Font family and size fields disabled in prefs:Quartz
4. Bottom Tool-tips bar too small now: Should be the same height as the console font.
5. Window resizing throwing warnings about deprecated functions.
6. Default directory, CRAN, and save on quit settings forgotten (reset) from time to time.
7. Using desktop folder throws warnings on Sierra
objc[13440]: Class FIFinderSyncExtensionHost is implemented in both /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/FinderKit.framework/Versions/A/FinderKit (0x7fffb2988a70) and /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/FileProvider.framework/OverrideBundles/FinderSyncCollaborationFileProviderOverride.bundle/Contents/MacOS/FinderSyncCollaborationFileProviderOverride (0x116fcecd8). One of the two will be used. Which one is undefined.

Thanks so much for taking the time to respond. ? I followed the Xcode 
instructions in your first paragraph and? instructions and everything is 
working now as expected.? Not sure what happened before.? As of last 
year, more that half my students now live in the Mac world, so it seems 
I need to up my skill level.

Enjoyed the little tcltk exercise/test you supplied.??? Thanks again.

Sincerely,

Rob

Dear Robert,

If I understand you correctly, you had to agree to the Xcode license in order to get the tcltk and Rcmdr packages to work. That wasn't my experience. Is it possible that you did something else, like rebooting your computer after installing XQuartz?

The reason I ask is that I want to understand what went wrong in case someone else has a similar problem in future.

Best,
 John

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] R 3.4.2 on High Sierra (10.13)
Message-ID: <02c19d88-3328-8a82-6ded-6ca931e315b4@stats.ox.ac.uk>

[Repeating for convenient reference a comment in an earlier thread.]

R 3.4.2 was in code freeze when High Sierra as released, and so there 
was no opportunity to make and test workarounds for undocumented changes 
to the latter.

R will be unable to find the system timezone on High Sierra (confirmed 
with the CRAN 3.4.2 release):

 > Sys.timezone()
[1] NA
 > .leap.seconds
  [1] "1972-07-01 GMT" "1973-01-01 GMT" "1974-01-01 GMT" "1975-01-01 GMT"

Warning message:
In as.POSIXlt.POSIXct(x, tz) : unknown timezone 'default/Europe/London'


Perhaps the best workaround is to use R-patched from 
http://r.research.att.com/ .  However, in almost all cases a workaround 
is to set TZ, either outside the session (not so easy for R.app) or at 
the beginning of the session by e.g.

Sys.setenv(TZ = "Europe/London")

(where the correct value will be obvious from running the code above).

Unfortunately, I can?t remember the details very clearly.  My memory is that I chose the XQuartz link from the CRAN page and installed, but I don?t remember if I rebooted for sure.  It is possible that I did not.  I also do not specifically remember if I did a license agreement step although I imagine I did.  

 I have done some cookbook homebrew and pip incantations on this machine that I suppose could contribute to a ?my fault? situation here.  

Thanks again for your help and I?ll be eves dropping on this list going forward to see if it is newbie  (lack of) skills that was my downfall or something more real.

Rob

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Executing iOS system code within R
Message-ID: <CA+dpOJ=SATqS7fJV=1zqWM4v4Xs9d6Vqn1PCRK54nqK+DFMHwA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi again,

I need to execute few line of system codes for iOS from R. Basically
that execution involves (as an example) :

1. Change the Working directory first
2. Execute some task (e.g.deleting a file)
3. Then go back to original folder/directory

I am aware of system() function which can be used here. However it
looks that system() function executes iOS code one-by-one i.e. after I
execute system('cd .....') for #1 above, that changed directory is not
passed for #2 and so on.

Is there any way where I can run a chain on iOS code as-a-whole using R.

Your help will be highly appreciated.

Thanks for your time.

Did you mean macOS?  I am not aware of anything that can run both R
and iOS code - if there's some fancy thing out there that can, i would
like to know about that.  ;-)

I was kind of wondering that myself...given the frequent prior discussions here regarding running R on iOS... :-)

My recommendation would be to use R's built in file/folder/path related functionality, such as:

  ?getwd (which includes ?setwd)

  ?list.files

  ?file.info

  ?files

and other related functions listed under the "See Also" sections of those help pages.

You can use getwd() to store the current working directory in a vector, execute whatever system() level commands you need to, then restore the current working directory to the original:

  CurrDir <- getwd()

  system(YourSystemLevelCallsHere)

  setwd(CurrDir)

Marc Schwartz

something like:

system("PWD=`pwd`; cd TARGETDIR; ./runme.sh; cd $PWD') will do basically this.

Every time you run the system call it should be spawning a new shell
with a fresh environment.

Hi Elijah, your suggestion is perfect - basically, I need to use ';'
as separator between multiple lines of iOS code. Thanks for this
pointer.

I would be most interested to get a solution for my problem in rJava 
install.

R 3.4.2

MacOSx 10.12.6, Sierra

Xcode 9.

If I install the rJava package, I get this error:

#######

clang does not understand the option -fopenmp

This version of clang comes with xCode 9:
Apple LLVM version 9.0.0 (clang-900.0.37)
Target: x86_64-apple-darwin16.7.0
Thread model: posix
InstalledDir: 
/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin

Then I install clang 5.0.0

clang version 5.0.0 (tags/RELEASE_500/final)
Target: x86_64-apple-darwin16.7.0
Thread model: posix
InstalledDir: /usr/local/opt/llvm/bin

This time, the error is:

clang-5.0: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see

Has someone a solution to compile rJava ?

Thanks

The temporary solution was to load the compiled version of the package:
https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/el-capitan/contrib/3.4/rJava_0.9-9.tgz

Uncompress with double-click,

and replace the rJava (from previous installation) folder with this new 
one in:
 > .libPaths()
[1] "/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.4/Resources/library"

It is not very elegant but until now it works.

Greetings and Salutations Marc, 

The ?-fopenmp? issue indicates you are using Xcode?s clang compiler that does _not_ support OpenMP as Apple has yet to enable it in their fork of the llvm project. As of R 3.4.0, the macOS binary of _R_ uses a custom toolchain that explicitly supports OpenMP. The downside of this approach is the custom toolchain does _not_ ship with the R binary. As a result, you will need to obtain the necessary clang4 binary from http://r.research.att.com/libs/ and modify your local ~/.R/Makevars appropriately to point to this new compiler. 

To simplify the process, I?ve created an installer that automatically puts the clang4 binary in the correct place and sets up the relevant paths for ~/.R/Makevars. 

This installer can be found here:

https://uofi.box.com/v/r-macos-clang-pkg

The source code used to create the installer is publically available here:

https://github.com/coatless/r-macos-clang 

The latest version of the installer is developer signed thanks to a financial contribution by Professor Timothy Bates (http://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/timothy-bates) of the University of Edinburgh that allowed me to join the Apple Developer program. 

If you are interested in learning more about enabling OpenMP on macOS for R, you may wish to check out:

Sincerely,

JJB

Hi

One question about home-brew installation:

After upgrading to High Sierra (and update to R 3.4.2), I don?t get tcl-tk support in R.

I get the following error:

	> library(tcltk)
	Error: package or namespace load failed for ?tcltk?:
	 .onLoad failed in loadNamespace() for 'tcltk', details:
	  call: fun(libname, pkgname)
	  error: Tcl/Tk support is not available on this system
	In addition: Warning message:

Is this a problem on my side, or is there a problem with R & homebrew & High Sierra & tcl-tk?

Thanks,

Rainer

Caveat. I know almost nothing about homebrew other than its function and the fact that users of it often have problems with installing R properly. The CRAN page for the Mac R 3.4.2 fork says:

-------begin-------
Contains R 3.4.2 framework, R.app GUI 1.70 in 64-bit for Intel Macs, Tcl/Tk 8.6.6 X11 libraries and Texinfo 5.2. The latter two components are optional and can be ommitted when choosing "custom install", they are only needed if you want to use the tcltk R package or build package documentation from sources.

The latter two components are optional and can be ommitted when choosing "custom install", they are only needed if you want to use the tcltk R package or build package documentation from sources.
-----end----

So it makes me wonder if you need to add the correct versions of the underlying system packages in a manner that your homebrew installation can find them. (the 3.3 fork uses a differnt version of Tcl/Tk.)

I intended that the next sentence be here (and wan't intending two copies of those sentences):

Note: the use of X11 (including tcltk) requires XQuartz to be installed since it is no longer part of OS X. Always re-install XQuartz when upgrading your OS X to a new major version.

Hi,

   I tried to install Cairo graphics

https://www.cairographics.org/download/

   and I need to install Macports.

   I tried to install Macports on my Mac OS Sierra 10.12.6, and type "sudo
port install cairo", but it did not respond. I haven't seen any file name
or app called Macports, but one file called "port" which is located at

loca/bin/port"

   How should I do it?

   Thanks,

John

This is related to Macports and not to R - please post your question on their mailing list. If it would be about errors installing R, that would be different.

Cheers,

Rainer

Thanks David - but no luck. Still the same problems - even after installing quartz again.

I was not sure whether the  list of items included: "Intel Macs, Tcl/Tk 8.6.6 X11 libraries and Texinfo 5.2" was missing a comma between 8.6.6 and X11 libraries or conversely  that TCL/Tk 8.6.6 was supposed to indicate a particular version of Quartz. Looking at the various webpages for those two packages, I don't see any change in XQuartz' version numbers whereas there has been quite a bit of updating of TCL/Tk.

I think using MacPorts might actually be the "error" that needs correction. I would suggest an alternate strategy. Go to http://r.research.att.com/libs/ and get the appropriate version of cairo, probably the most recent one. 

http://r.research.att.com/libs/cairo-1.14.2-darwin.13-x86_64.tar.gz

Scroll down to the bottom of that page and an appropriate modification of the two lines for unpacking to the root. 

curl -O http://r.research.att.com/libs/cairo-1.14.2-darwin.13-x86_64.tar.gz
sudo tar fvxz gmp-4.2.4-darwin8-bin4.tar.gz -C /


The Mac version of R does not do well with either MacPorts or homebrew installation of required system packages because those package managers put them in loaction that are not recognized by the static build that is the default.

Using homebrew (and as far as I know Macports as well) works without major problems. The problem start when you mix standard installations / homebrew / Macports. This results in problems. 

So: each of the approaches has it?s own pros and cons - it is only that homebrew and Macports are not officially supported by the R team.

Cheers,

Rainer

The fact that the original poster had obviously not used MacPorts (and perhaps did not even know what it was) suggests that the appropriate reply should be to discourage him from using it and offer a strategy with greater likelihood of success in combination with the more typical installation method for the Mac R fork.

One of the cons is that both homebrew and MacPorts requires a greater knowledge of the Unix under-pinnings of MacOS. If a poster is asking how to install MacPorts, it suggests that he don't already have such skills and perhaps doesn't even have the motivation to acquire them. (Your earlier response suggested that posting in R-SIG-Mac was the wrong way to do acquire such skills and I agree. Appears the poster has not yet developed the habit of reading supporting online documentation. He certainly did not do so regarding R-SIG-Mac. My opinion: A person who chooses not to read or heed online documentation should be actively discouraged from using either MacPorts of homebrew.) 

Best;
David.

Thanks, David and Rainer.

Where should I type them? On RStudio command line?

curl -O http://r.research.att.com/libs/cairo-1.14.2-darwin.13-x86_64.tar.gz
sudo tar fvxz gmp-4.2.4-darwin8-bin4.tar.gz -C /


I got this after typing in RStudio command line
> curl -O
http://r.research.att.com/libs/cairo-1.14.2-darwin.13-x86_64.tar.gz
Error: unexpected symbol in "curl -O http"

Those are Unix system functions, not R or RStudio functions. Do some reading regarding Unix bash and the MacOS Terminal.app

John,

You could spin your wheels for a long time on this, because it seems that you lack some basic information, not related to R.  You best plan might be to drop consideration of R for a few weeks, to brush up on the basics. But, if just need to get R working for some particular one-off task, your should consider finding someone local you can help you in-person, in exchange for a coffee / beer / lunch.

I think using MacPorts might actually be the "error" that needs correction. I would suggest an alternate strategy. Go to http://r.research.att.com/libs/ and get the appropriate version of cairo, probably the most recent one.

http://r.research.att.com/libs/cairo-1.14.2-darwin.13-x86_64.tar.gz

Scroll down to the bottom of that page and an appropriate modification of the two lines for unpacking to the root.

The Mac version of R does not do well with either MacPorts or homebrew installation of required system packages because those package managers put them in loaction that are not recognized by the static build that is the default.

Using homebrew (and as far as I know Macports as well) works without major problems. The problem start when you mix standard installations / homebrew / Macports. This results in problems.

The fact that the original poster had obviously not used MacPorts (and perhaps did not even know what it was) suggests that the appropriate reply should be to discourage him from using it and offer a strategy with greater likelihood of success in combination with the more typical installation method for the Mac R fork.


So: each of the approaches has it?s own pros and cons - it is only that homebrew and Macports are not officially supported by the R team.

One of the cons is that both homebrew and MacPorts requires a greater knowledge of the Unix under-pinnings of MacOS. If a poster is asking how to install MacPorts, it suggests that he don't already have such skills and perhaps doesn't even have the motivation to acquire them. (Your earlier response suggested that posting in R-SIG-Mac was the wrong way to do acquire such skills and I agree. Appears the poster has not yet developed the habit of reading supporting online documentation. He certainly did not do so regarding R-SIG-Mac. My opinion: A person who chooses not to read or heed online documentation should be actively discouraged from using either MacPorts of homebrew.)

Best;
David.

Rainer

Hi,

How should I do it?

The reason I'm here is to translate Mac-speak like "homebrew" and

If you know your way around in Linux, I would suggest looking into homebrew - it essentially brings the approach of apt (in the case of debian) to a Mac. If not, you might be better off with the official R installers. But all work equally after installed.

Dear Rainer;

I think it might be a bit more complicated than "just use the same installer all the time", but am not a user of either homebrew or MacPorts so am speaking only from reports I have read in this mailing list and SO. Bob Rudis whom I also respect in such matters has several times made the same suggestion. I think there may need to be supplemental instructions on setting system environment variables and also possibly further changes to Makevars files in some packages being obtained from CRAN or BioC. I have been encouraged by others to switch to homebrew, but have never found a sufficiently complete tutorial that appeared to cover these other issues. If you know of one, Rainer, I think you should share it.

Best;
David.

Message-ID: <303CD3A3-230A-4D18-A190-E6C2D1160DF3@llnl.gov>

The OP's question has inspired an interestingly large number of responses.

One thing I'm curious about, and I don't think I've seen in the discussion, is why the OP needed to install Cairo graphics with respect to R (otherwise the question was indeed off-topic for R-sig-Mac).

In summary (and I think this is reasonably consistent with other responses; discussion to support my summary follows):

1)  Use CRAN R, install dependencies needed for extended R capability on the OS as needed, from whatever source you prefer, or whichever is easiest for R to use
2)  If one chooses to install R using MacPorts or homebrew, be prepared to exercise a greater depth of computer science smarts
3)  Feel free to install other useful stuff using MacPorts or homebrew, whichever one prefers; there is unlikely to be any conflict with R


In close to 20 years of using R on Mac, I have always been able to use whatever capabilities R offers that I wanted to use, using the R provided on CRAN. Nothing has ever motivated me to install R using MacPorts or homebrew in order to obtain some capability that I couldn't have using CRAN's binary download for Mac. This includes things like access to remote Oracle databases, using various spatial packages built around sp and rgdal, reading and writing MS Office files (both Word and Excel), building simple tcl/tk interfaces, writing my own packages that link to Fortran, and probably more that I don't remember. I see no necessity to install R from MacPorts or homebrew. Of course, if one wishes to for whatever reason, great! And I'm glad that people have wanted to make R available from those package managers.

I do use MacPorts, however, to get useful software such as an X Windows aware version of emacs, ghostscript, and ImageMagick. Indeed, I even have cairo installed using MacPorts, albeit on a 10.11.6 system, not a 10.12.x system like the OP. (It's probably there as a dependency for some other MacPorts package.) From that point of view, the OP's command to install it using MacPorts was correct. I'd need more information to make a guess at why it didn't succeed.

Some R packages do, of course, depend on external libraries not provided with R. One has to install these from somewhere.  For example, the spatial packages need GDAL. In this case, I use the KyngChaos frameworks, but I'm aware that they're also available from MacPorts (and probably homebrew as well). Could I use them instead? Probably; R is pretty good about letting the user specify where dependencies are found.

I do not know what R extended capability depends on installing Cairo graphics on the OS. The X11() graphics device, as provided (I believe), has a version that uses cairo. There is the Cairo R package, but it has a binary version, at least for R on 10.11.x, so there's no need to install Cairo graphics to install the Cairo package.

    Dear Rainer;
    
    I think it might be a bit more complicated than "just use the same installer all the time", but am not a user of either homebrew or MacPorts so am speaking only from reports I have read in this mailing list and SO. Bob Rudis whom I also respect in such matters has several times made the same suggestion. I think there may need to be supplemental instructions on setting system environment variables and also possibly further changes to Makevars files in some packages being obtained from CRAN or BioC. I have been encouraged by others to switch to homebrew, but have never found a sufficiently complete tutorial that appeared to cover these other issues. If you know of one, Rainer, I think you should share it.
    
    Best;
    David.

I do not want to mess this ML with yet another option, but Fink, another package manager for macOS, is also an option.  The main reasons I use Fink is to make sure GIS related CRAN packages (e.g. regal) are linked to Fink installed GIS packages (e.g. gdal).

Fink:
1. allows you to have multiple versions of R (e.g. 3.4, 3.3 and 3.2);
2.?has a number of CRAN/BioC packages to be stored in /sw/lib/R/3.4/site-library, /sw/lib/R/3.3/site-library and /sw/lib/R/3.2/site-library respectively
(CRAN/BioC libraries are linked to Fink packages);
3. allows users to use CRAN (saved in user directory) and Fink installed package; and
4. does not depend on non-System/Fink installed shared libraries  (so that regal will not be wrongly linked to user-installed gdal)

$ otool -L /sw/lib/R/3.3/site-library/rgdal/libs/rgdal.dylib 
/sw/lib/R/3.3/site-library/rgdal/libs/rgdal.dylib:
	/sw/lib/R/3.3/site-library/rgdal/libs/rgdal.dylib (compatibility version 0.0.0, current version 0.0.0)

Interesting discussion, even if it is technically off-topic (i.e. is about
a Macports issue rather than an R issue).

For myself, I have found instances where I needed to install R through
non-standard channels (my choice lately has been homebrew). This was
largely related to having the required system tools necessary for a package
development environment that permits the compilation of C/fortran code and
some system libraries (gdal, etc). As Don and others pointed out many such
dependencies should be available through the OSX R develop page (forget the
address right now ...), I have some older machines for which those
precompiled binaries do not install, including a 9 year old Macbook which
will run OSX up to ElCapitan but is not compatible with the newer binaries.
In that case, in order to have an R and gfortran that played together I had
to use homebrew as I could not find a binary gfortran that would work for
my architecture.

I love working on OSX, though I have often lamented the difficulties in
getting a suitable package development environment configured -- at least
compared to Windows (just install Rtools.exe) and Linux (everything
required is easily installed from the distro package manager).

I have two older Macs of roughly the same vintage, both running El Cap. Regarding gfortran for package devel, I wondered if you had noticed that advice at the top of the CRAN Tools page to add some locations to a Makevars file:

https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools/

I was having difficulties until someone gently reminded me to "read the manual".

GDAL (and associated packages) are generally obtained from Kyngchaos and that has been the case for as long as I remember.

Interesting. Thanks for the "gentle reminder". I haven't visited that page
in some time, because it has been quite awhile since the gfortran-4.2.3
packages were appropriate, and the bit about the Makevars I think is new
since the last time I had to go through setting up a machine.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] ifelse script
Message-ID: <6ED4194A-C6DF-487D-9C42-C99D1FC3183D@upr.edu>

Hello.

I got one new variable computed using ifelse through R Commander. The variable was created without a problem. This was the expression to compute:

ifelse(icdfrrcond1 == 1 | icdfrrcond2 == 1 | icdfrrcond3 == 1 | icdfrrcond4  == 1 | icdfrrcond5  == 1 | icdfrrcond6 == 1 | icdfrrcond7 == 1 | icdfrrcond8 == 1 | icdfrrcond9  == 1 | icdfrrcond10  == 1 | icdfrrcond11  == 1 | icdfrrcond12  == 1 | icdfrrcond13 == 1 |  icdfrrcond14  == 1 | icdfrrcond15   == 1 | icdfrrcond16 == 1 | icdfrrcond17  == 1 | icdfrrcond18 == 1 | icdfrrcond19  == 1 | icdfrrcond20  == 1, icdfrischhrtdis <- 1, icdfrischhrtdis <- 0)

This is the script generated by R Commander:

mortprres0515sle$icdfrischhrtdis <- with(mortprres0515sle, ifelse(icdfrrcond1 ==   1 | icdfrrcond2 == 1 | icdfrrcond3 == 1 | icdfrrcond4  == 1 | icdfrrcond5  == 1 |   icdfrrcond6 == 1 | icdfrrcond7 == 1 | icdfrrcond8 == 1 | icdfrrcond9  == 1 |   icdfrrcond10  == 1 | icdfrrcond11  == 1 | icdfrrcond12  == 1 | icdfrrcond13 == 1   |  icdfrrcond14  == 1 | icdfrrcond15   == 1 | icdfrrcond16 == 1 | icdfrrcond17    == 1 | icdfrrcond18 == 1 | icdfrrcond19  == 1 | icdfrrcond20  == 1,   icdfrischhrtdis <- 1, icdfrischhrtdis <- 0))

When I try to run this same script from RStudio or the R console, the script is read, but the variable is not created. Even if I highlight the script in R Commander and ?Submit? it, I get the same problem.

What I would like to do is to copy the script and modify it, so I can create 10 additional variables using just one script that I can run directly in R or RStudio.

Thanks.

That's not the way to use ifelse():  it's not a control sequence like 
"if (cond) ... else ...", it's a function.  You should write it as

icdfrischhrtdis <- ifelse(icdfrrcond1 == 1 | icdfrrcond2 == 1 | 
icdfrrcond3 == 1 | icdfrrcond4  == 1 | icdfrrcond5  == 1 | icdfrrcond6 
== 1 | icdfrrcond7 == 1 | icdfrrcond8 == 1 | icdfrrcond9  == 1 | 
icdfrrcond10  == 1 | icdfrrcond11  == 1 | icdfrrcond12  == 1 | 
icdfrrcond13 == 1 |  icdfrrcond14  == 1 | icdfrrcond15   == 1 | 
icdfrrcond16 == 1 | icdfrrcond17  == 1 | icdfrrcond18 == 1 | 
icdfrrcond19  == 1 | icdfrrcond20  == 1, 1, 0)

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Macports installation problem

Very useful discussion, and I think it is relevant for r-sig-macin many regards.

Not the least, it offers new users, whatever background, information on the different options on installing R.

I think it would be a very useful thing to add these installation methods to the CRAN page as they definitely have their merits - specifically when dealing with spatial data and GDAL versions and updates, and consistency of using the same GDAL.

In contrast to others, I had bad experiences with mixed installations - especially gdal. At the very least, it creates situations, where it is quite difficult to understand which gdal version is used.

I would therefore always recommend to stick to one installation method - MacPorts, homebrew, Fink or standard / frameworks.

Unfortunately, the resources of installing R under homebrew are scattered around - not the least, because there is no home for an ?official? and ?supported? method.

Cheers,

Rainer

Hi,

   I tried to install Cairo graphics

https://www.cairographics.org/download/

   and I need to install Macports.

   I tried to install Macports on my Mac OS Sierra 10.12.6, and type "sudo
port install cairo", but it did not respond. I haven't seen any file name
or app called Macports, but one file called "port" which is located at

loca/bin/port"

   How should I do it?

   Thanks,

John
