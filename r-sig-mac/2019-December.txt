Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] help with GUI for R.4.0.0  for Mac Catalina
Message-ID: <587C371D-0DC1-4DFB-A26F-673E242CBEA8@revelle.net>

Dear friends,

I am trying to do the final tests on the next version of psych.  I am testing it on r 4.0.0 which I can do using X-Quartz and R CMD  ? etc.

However, it would be nice to run R.4.0.0  with Simon?s GUI for my normal work.  I have tried to load 4.0,0 several times from the R.developers page (for Macs) which says that the GUI is included.  However, the GUI fails to appear any where.

I can run 4.0.0 with R-Studio or X-Quartz so I clearly have R installed.  But the GUI does not open. (the 3.6.1 GUI breaks).

I assume that I am missing something.  Hints would be appreciated.

Bill

Not exactly helpful, but I have had the exact same experience for over a month.  I don?t think that GUI is in the package.   Bryan

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Error when fitting a brms model,
 maybe associated with Catalina MacOS
Message-ID: <CABkCotTb-yDS4gO-z9RVN0+=sQs47v4BP7tdvA+RyE_iZvZaAQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list members,

When trying to fit this example from the CRAN repository fro brms, I got
the following error message after the 4th chain.  I am using R 3.6.1 in
Catalina MacOS.


library(brms)

group <- rep(c("treat", "placebo"), each = 30)
symptom_post <- c(rnorm(30, mean = 1, sd = 2), rnorm(30, mean = 0, sd = 1))
dat1 <- data.frame(group, symptom_post)

fit1 <- brm(bf(symptom_post ~ group, sigma ~ group),
            data = dat1, family = gaussian())


[1] "Error in sampler$call_sampler(args_list[[i]]) : "
[2] "  c++ exception (unknown reason)"
error occurred during calling the sampler; sampling not done

I think is a problem with Catalina MacOS, but I don?t know how to solve it.

Manuel

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] R-devel version?
Message-ID: <B5AE6D0F-F1AE-4D4D-960A-B9A4490D0365@illinois.edu>

It looks to me on the R for Mac OS X Developer's Page  that the latest version of R-devel for os x is
(2019/11/07, r77386)  and since there seem to be many packages out of compliance that need
updating with respect to later versions of 4.0, I wonder whether there is an alternative source
for those of us who are prisoners of os x and too lazy to build R-devel  from sources.  Or am
I misinterpreting something?

What worked for me was installing the tools using https://github.com/rmacoslib/r-macos-rtools/releases

and then installing rstan from source ie install.packages(?rstan?,type=?source) as suggested on one of the stan forums

Thank you very much to all.

Does Installing the macos-rtools could affect R in other ways?

Roger,

the last build was yesterday, but svn update was failing so the R sources were not updating. It should be fixed now. Please note that we're still deciding on the target macOS and toolchain for 4.0 given the Catalina release so it is subject to change. 

Thanks,
Simon

No, it only downloads and installs the right compilers and updates Makevars and REnvirons. These are what Stan and RCpp require so you could do these manually.

What it does is described at https://github.com/rmacoslib/r-macos-rtools

An update.

Before doing the suggested installation, I updated Catalina to 10.5.2,
Xtools to 11.3 and the Command Line Tools and it works.

Greetings and Salutations All,

Great to see the `r-macos-rtools` installer popping up! As the author of it, please note that it's an unofficial (non-CRAN backed) installer that seeks to automatically establish the CRAN toolchain in a friendly GUI installer. We developed it to help out students in STAT 385 @ UIUC [ http://stat385.com/ ]  setup the correct developer environment in a uniform manner as there wasn't really any prior installer packages made available at the time. We're grateful for the financial support that was given by Timothy Bates to sign the installer.

With this being said, each step the installer takes is documented across a README file, installer splash screen, and by a post.

README Overview: https://github.com/rmacoslib/r-macos-rtools#what-does-the-installer-do 
Installer Splash: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rmacoslib/r-macos-rtools/master/readme_img/lock_icon.png 
Post: https://thecoatlessprofessor.com/programming/cpp/r-compiler-tools-for-rcpp-on-macos/ 

That said, there is also Appendix C.3 macOS of R Installation and Administration [ https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-admin.html#macOS ] that goes over the details in greater depth.

For those who are worried about security, please note that we've taken steps to ensure secure downloads by verifying the installer hashes prior to installing per prior remarks by Simon regarding earlier versions of the installer [ see the prior discussion and my response here: https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-mac/2018-May/012745.html ]. 

Lastly, and perhaps more critically, please note that just using Xcode CLI is not sufficient as it does not match the prescribed compilation toolchain (clang7 with OpenMP enabled and gfortran). 

Best,

JJB

Message-ID: <5A2D8199-105D-4A77-9128-296550AF611C@rud.is>

While easily remedied via right-click + open, out-of-the-box installer gives the Apple daft (and technically incorrect since Apple could most certainly check it for malicious software):

    ?R-3.6.2.pkg? can?t be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software.

message.


Here's what spctl returns:

    $ spctl -a -vv -t install R-3.6.2.pkg
    R-3.6.2.pkg: rejected
    source=Unnotarized Developer ID
    origin=Developer ID Installer: Simon Urbanek (VZLD955F6P)


NOTE: R & R.app work fine once installed.

Not sure if this is going to cause consternation in "corporate" environments.

Bob,

thanks - oddly, it didn't show when I tested it on Catalina, there must be a flag somewhere. As discussed before we cannot notarize any version of R before 4.0.0 so Catalina users have to either stick to 3.5.1 (since Apple has grand-fathered installers create before Catalina) or use the Ctrl+click way to install R 3.6.2.

Cheers,
Simon

3.6.2 was released on the 12th and it's been on all the CRAN mirrors I, er, "monitor", including the cran.r-project.org site (https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/R-3.6.2.pkg).

Yes but I don't see the installer on the CRAN site, I only see the installer for 3.6.1.  Am I missing something?  Not a complaint,  just don't see it?  I did clear my caches.

Thanks,

-Roy

$!$!$$$@!+!.  

So I went there,  still saw old version.  Cleared cache,  went again,  still saw old version.  Cleared cache again,  went there,  saw new version.  Grrr.  The kind of small things that drive me nuts.

Thanks,

Dear list members,

I updated everything, Catalina, Xcode, CLT, R 3.6.2, rstan from source, and
installed the r-macos-rtools, but I still have problems.

library(brms)
group <- rep(c("treat", "placebo"), each = 30)
symptom_post <- c(rnorm(30, mean = 1, sd = 2), rnorm(30, mean = 0, sd = 1))
dat1 <- data.frame(group, symptom_post)

fit1 <- brm(bf(symptom_post ~ group, sigma ~ group),
            data = dat1, family = gaussian())

Chain 4: Iteration:    1 / 2000 [  0%]  (Warmup)
[1] "Error in sampler$call_sampler(args_list[[i]]) : "
[2] "  c++ exception (unknown reason)"
error occurred during calling the sampler; sampling not done

As the author of it, please note that it's an unofficial (non-CRAN backed) installer that seeks to automatically establish the CRAN toolchain in a friendly GUI installer. We developed it to help out students in STAT 385 @ UIUC [ http://stat385.com/ ]  setup the correct developer environment in a uniform manner as there wasn't really any prior installer packages made available at the time. We're grateful for the financial support that was given by Timothy Bates to sign the installer.

Dear Manuel,

As far as I can tell, a lot of people are experiencing problems with rstan under Catalina -- I don't use brms but rather rstan directly, and I thrashed around quite a bit to get it work reliably (at least so far!).

The final bit of the puzzle for me was to modify Makevars in the .R subdirectory of my home directory according to the instructions at <https://discourse.mc-stan.org/t/dealing-with-catalina-ii/11802/74>. Maybe that will work for you too. If this is in fact a generally satisfactory solution, one would hope that it could be made more convenient for macOS rstan users.

I hope this helps,
 John

Thank you very much John.

I restarted my computer, and everything looks fine now, I fitted a brms
model without the error message.

Just a comment on the macos-rtools. It seems wrong to me to set the user
level ~/.R/Makevars.

Kasper,

With all due respect, setting up the ~/.R/Makevars file is a key step that trips up a majority of users. Sadly, the documentation for Makevars is not beginner friendly  and is scattered across multiple manuals [1][2] with the most precise explanation being off-site [3]. Moreover, many do not know about R's startup files [4], how to modify them, or where they exist as dot files are hidden by default [5].  

I've toyed with many solutions over the years, including but not limited to: providing an R script to write the lines to ~/.R/Makevars, emphasizing that `file.edit()` can be used to open the configuration files, providing step-by-step guides, and so on. The most successful approach taken was to provide as much of an automated process as possible while emphasizing the steps for those who wanted more depth. 

Having said this, my dream is for the macOS CRAN binary to come with everything configured and setup correctly. Until that is the case or there exists a better approach, I'm more inclined to stick with the current approach I've taken especially as the macOS toolchain's stability changes on minor point releases (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH). Again, these are made freely available to address an ever clearer need that is arising in the community. 

Best,

JJB,

to be honest, what surprises me is why people don't use the most straight-forward way documented very explicitly in the installer which is simply


export PATH=/usr/local/clang7/bin:$PATH

I never touch Makevars as that is very error-prone and makes it impossible to use multiple R versions. CRAN is already configured correctly for those compilers so you should not need to do any manual overrides.

Cheers,
Simon

Sadly, the documentation for Makevars is not beginner friendly  and is scattered across multiple manuals [1][2] with the most precise explanation being off-site [3]. Moreover, many do not know about R's startup files [4], how to modify them, or where they exist as dot files are hidden by default [5].

The most successful approach taken was to provide as much of an automated process as possible while emphasizing the steps for those who wanted more depth.

Until that is the case or there exists a better approach, I'm more inclined to stick with the current approach I've taken especially as the macOS toolchain's stability changes on minor point releases (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH). Again, these are made freely available to address an ever clearer need that is arising in the community.

Setting the PATH in the shell does not apply to applications on macOS,
e.g. I customize the PATH in my .zshrc, and yet in R.app I have the
vanilla PATH:
> Sys.getenv("PATH")
[1] "/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin"

RStudio is similar.

Sadly, the documentation for Makevars is not beginner friendly  and is scattered across multiple manuals [1][2] with the most precise explanation being off-site [3]. Moreover, many do not know about R's startup files [4], how to modify them, or where they exist as dot files are hidden by default [5].

The most successful approach taken was to provide as much of an automated process as possible while emphasizing the steps for those who wanted more depth.

Until that is the case or there exists a better approach, I'm more inclined to stick with the current approach I've taken especially as the macOS toolchain's stability changes on minor point releases (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH). Again, these are made freely available to address an ever clearer need that is arising in the community.

(Re-sent to list without installer image)

Simon,

Thank you for the question.  The installation splash for clang7 is generic in where to place it (see below). If done so outside of ~/.Renviron, then the option is not used. This is especially the case with RStudio, which a large target market of the macOS community is using.

---
Text from the clang7 installer:

> In order to use this compiler you have to add /usr/local/clang7/bin to the PATH environment variable such as

export PATH=/usr/local/clang7/bin:$PATH

---

Regarding Makevars, for those who are not on R 3.6.2, there was an issue with where the headers are located on macOS Catalina. All the *FLAGS needed to be updated to use:

-isysroot /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk

Again, this may have changed with respect to R 3.6.2, but that was the case for the earlier version on Catalina.

Moreover, there was an ABI compatibility issue with macOS Catalina that caused Stan chains to need an override on the SHLIB_CXXLDFLAGS variable. (Many thanks to Sebastian Weber, Kevin Ushey, and Ben Goodrich for their assistance in rooting this out.)

For discussion on this issue, please see:

- https://discourse.mc-stan.org/t/dealing-with-catalina/11285
- https://discourse.mc-stan.org/t/dealing-with-catalina-ii/11802

Also, Sebastian's post to the list-serv:

https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-mac/2019-November/013116.html

If you have time to talk, I'm more than happy to compare notes to improve this process.

Best,

JJB

    JJB,
    
    to be honest, what surprises me is why people don't use the most straight-forward way documented very explicitly in the installer which is simply
    
    
export PATH=/usr/local/clang7/bin:$PATH
    
    I never touch Makevars as that is very error-prone and makes it impossible to use multiple R versions. CRAN is already configured correctly for those compilers so you should not need to do any manual overrides.
    
    Cheers,
    Simon

Sadly, the documentation for Makevars is not beginner friendly  and is scattered across multiple manuals [1][2] with the most precise explanation being off-site [3]. Moreover, many do not know about R's startup files [4], how to modify them, or where they exist as dot files are hidden by default [5].

The most successful approach taken was to provide as much of an automated process as possible while emphasizing the steps for those who wanted more depth.

Until that is the case or there exists a better approach, I'm more inclined to stick with the current approach I've taken especially as the macOS toolchain's stability changes on minor point releases (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH). Again, these are made freely available to address an ever clearer need that is arising in the community.

Message-ID: <495d3dbe-75b9-e0e0-2b46-db83d1adc21d@yahoo.fr>

When I load the last version of raster package in MacOS, I get a segfault:

This is similar to the problem described here:

https://r.789695.n4.nabble.com/Raster-package-crash-with-segmentation-fault-td4759487.html

or here

https://github.com/rspatial/raster/issues/63

The last working version for me is the 2.5-8 installed with:

require(devtools)
install_version("raster", version = "2.5-8", repos 
="http://cran.us.r-project.org")

I would like know if the problem with the raster package is common in 
macOSX or if there is something special for me.

Thanks a lot

library(raster) works fine for me.  This loads 3.0-7.  I'm on MacOS 
10.13.6, likely older than whatever you are using.

This works fine for me using R 3.6.2 on MacOS 10.15.2

The only difference from a standard installation is that I have the setup for Rcpp, but that shouldn?t change anything.

You should realize that postings on Nabble are not necessarily going to have reached the ?true? mailing list.

Dear All

among disasters of the new operating system Catalina, this one concerns R.

Trying to install ?regtools"  the answer by Crane R consolle is 

unable to access index for repository https://cran.stat.unipd.it/bin/macosx/el-capitan/contrib/3.6 <https://cran.stat.unipd.it/bin/macosx/el-capitan/contrib/3.6>

The same  for ?devtools?. This happens on my Mac with Catalina OS. The same installation on same Crane R but  on a laptop of colleauge of mine endowed with previous OS (el captain) succeeds without any problem.

Any remedy to suggest?

Thanks a lot

Bruno

Try another repository. It works fine with the main CRAN and teh RStudio repositories.

Also on Catalena: I can install without problems. Try a different repo? Can you open the URL in Safari?

Hmm, my best guess is that file downloads are failing somehow. It's not like, e.g.,

https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/macosx/el-capitan/contrib/3.6/PACKAGES.gz

is not on the website. 

Time to get scientific: Try putting a debug(download.file) and/or debug(available.packages), retry the install (or maybe just do available.packages(repos=....)), and single-step through the call to see where it goes wrong. One possibility is that you don't have write permission for the directory that it wants to download into, so figure out what the exact target is.

Something else changed on your system as Catalina does no domain/IP/URL blocking without user-intervention and those repo URLs work fine on all my (many) Catalina systems.

What else changed after you did the Catalina install?

There's a great deal wrong with Catalina, this is not one of those things.

Waiting for necessary patches by Apple, for the moment I?m comfortably running R on a Windows system.

Thanks for all.

Bruno, I doubt Apple is going to patch anything because the problem seems to be either on your computer or on your network. 

It smells to me that for example your host file, or something else, has been modified, or something in your network has also change that is blocking your access to that repository for some reason. 

I'm also on Catalina and as the rest I can access that repo on the browser, or any other, without a trouble. 

Anyhow, if you really think that the problem is on Apple side, you should contact them if you really expect them to produce any fix. 

Best of the lucks! 

Cheers!
Luis

Hello, All:


 ????? I just upgraded to R 3.6.2 and suddenly got, "cannot open 
compressed file" with "R CMD build" of a package that I built yesterday 
with R 3.6.1, and I don't recall having gotten an error message with 3.6.1.


 ????? What do you suggest I do to get around this?
 ????? Thanks,
 ????? Spencer Graves

"Permission denied" suggests that this is not related to R. Perhaps you ran R with elevated permissions yesterday?

Is this on the CRAN page?  Am I missing something?

As discussed before we cannot notarize any version of R before 4.0.0 so Catalina users have to either stick to 3.5.1 (since Apple has grand-fathered installers create before Catalina) or use the Ctrl+click way to install R 3.6.2.

Simon,

Thank you for the question.  The installation splash for clang7 is generic in where to place it (see attached). If done so outside of ~/.Renviron, then the option is not used. This is especially the case with RStudio, which a large target market of the macOS community is using. 

Regarding Makevars, for those who are not on R 3.6.2, there was an issue with where the headers are located on macOS Catalina. All the *FLAGS needed to be updated to use: 

-isysroot /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk 

Again, this may have changed with respect to R 3.6.2, but that was the case for the earlier version on Catalina. 

Moreover, there was an ABI compatibility issue with macOS Catalina that caused Stan chains to need an override on the SHLIB_CXXLDFLAGS variable. (Many thanks to Sebastian Weber, Kevin Ushey, and Ben Goodrich for their assistance in rooting this out.)

For discussion on this issue, please see:

- https://discourse.mc-stan.org/t/dealing-with-catalina/11285
- https://discourse.mc-stan.org/t/dealing-with-catalina-ii/11802

Also, Sebastian's post to the list-serv:

https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-mac/2019-November/013116.html

Best,

    JJB,
    
    to be honest, what surprises me is why people don't use the most straight-forward way documented very explicitly in the installer which is simply
    
    
export PATH=/usr/local/clang7/bin:$PATH
    
    I never touch Makevars as that is very error-prone and makes it impossible to use multiple R versions. CRAN is already configured correctly for those compilers so you should not need to do any manual overrides.
    
    Cheers,
    Simon

Sadly, the documentation for Makevars is not beginner friendly  and is scattered across multiple manuals [1][2] with the most precise explanation being off-site [3]. Moreover, many do not know about R's startup files [4], how to modify them, or where they exist as dot files are hidden by default [5].

The most successful approach taken was to provide as much of an automated process as possible while emphasizing the steps for those who wanted more depth.

Until that is the case or there exists a better approach, I'm more inclined to stick with the current approach I've taken especially as the macOS toolchain's stability changes on minor point releases (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH). Again, these are made freely available to address an ever clearer need that is arising in the community.
