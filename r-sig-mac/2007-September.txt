Nope, unless you include the crash report and some details on how to  
reproduce it - please read how to report bugs in the R FAQ.

Hi list,

I just upgraded to R 2.5.1 (OSX 10.4.10) and tried to reinstall some packages 
from source. But the compilation fails because -I/usr/include is not passed to 
the compiler and it can't find the header files. Any ideas how to solve 
this? (gcc works fine in other circumstances - I tried several packages 
with the same problem).

thanks
Wouter

-I/usr/include is not needed as those are system libraries.

Please make sure you have upgraded to Xcode 2.4.1 (as per FAQ) and  
you didn't de-install 10.4 universal SDK.

Ken,

my guess is (because you didn't tell us) that you're using iplots  
from within the R GUI. Currently that is officially not supported,  
but you can try you luck pasting the following code before loading  
iplots:

.jinit()
.jcall("java/lang/System","S","setProperty","register.about","false")
.jcall("java/lang/System","S","setProperty","register.open","false")
.jcall("java/lang/ 
System","S","setProperty","register.preferences","false")
.jcall("java/lang/System","S","setProperty","register.quit","false")

Note, however, that you're on your own. Due to the way the R and Java  
event loops mesh (or don't to be precise) on Mac OS X, you may  
encounter deadlocks, so I would recommend using JGR with iplots  
instead (at least on a Mac).

Cheers,
Simon

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Cannot get Tktable to work to run affylmGUI/limmaGUI
Message-ID: <19887.98137.qm@web62006.mail.re1.yahoo.com>

I am a novice level user with R and I'm also new to OS
X. I installed R and Bioconductor on my MacBook Pro
and subsequently learned I needed some additional
components to run affylmGUI. I then installed XCode
and X11 from the OS X Tiger DVD, then moved on to
installing the required BWidgets and Tktable. Bwidgets
was fine, but when I tried to make and install Tktable
I got the following error:

drdadr:/usr/local/lib/Tktable2.9 drfermin$ sudo make
install
 /usr/bin/install -c libTktable2.9.dylib
/usr/local/lib/Tktable2.9/libTktable2.9.dylib
install: libTktable2.9.dylib and
/usr/local/lib/Tktable2.9/libTktable2.9.dylib are the
same file
 : /usr/local/lib/Tktable2.9/libTktable2.9.dylib

/usr/local/lib/Tktable2.9/README.txt
install: ./README.txt and
/usr/local/lib/Tktable2.9/README.txt are the same file
make: *** [install-binaries] Error 64

I went back to the R console and added
/usr/local/lib/Tktable2.9 to the
tclvalue("auto_path"), but running affylmGUI() on X11
resulted in "cannot find tktable."

I tried compiling to a different directory using the
--prefix flag on configure, to no avail.

Finally, I found precompiled binaries of Tktable that
I downloaded and unpacked into the
/usr/local/lib/Tktable2.9 directory, but the command
tclRequire("Tktable") in R still resulted in:

[1] FALSE
Warning message:
Tcl package 'Tktable' not found in:
tclRequire("Tktable") 

What am I doing wrong? Could it have something to do
with file permissions on OS X, since I have to use
"sudo" to do every commmand? This is really holding up
my work. Any assistance is much appreciated; I
apologize if this is really a simple problem.

I may be wrong here, but you seem to try to install (components of)  
TclTK. The way to do this is install R from the CRAN binary. During  
installation you need to click "customize" and then choose TclTK from  
the menu.

Perhaps there is something special about afylmGUI, but I doubt it.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Applescript window selection question
Message-ID: <C30703B1.6182%john.daschbach@pnl.gov>

This is really an Applescript question, but I thought I would ask here.
What I really want is a reliable way to source() in R a buffer in Emacs.

How do you specify a certain window in the R interface using Applescript?

I am trying to use the R gui from Emacs.  The code at the end does this,
some of the time.  

The problem is that "tell window 1" addresses the window with focus in R, so
this only works when the console has focus.  If the Quartz window or the
Help window (or any other) has focus the Applescript fails.  This also
usually, but not always fails after an exception is thrown in the gui (R
error)

The window order in Applescript is the order from front to back.  However, I
have been getting errors trying to get a window from it's name, e.g.

    set nn to (get window whose name contains "Con")

This throws an error.  Even

set wn to (get name of window 1)
set nn to (get window whose name contains wn)

Does not work.

Thanks.

-John

In Emacs: 

(defun R-source-buffer ()
  (interactive)
  (save-excursion
    (let ((rbuf (current-buffer)))
      (save-buffer-to-load-file "/tmp/tmp.R")
      (shell-command "~/Common/Languages/Applescript/App/R01.app&")
      ;;(kill-buffer "*Async Shell Command*"))
      (pop-to-buffer rbuf))))
;;
;;  File name needs to be the same in the Applescript application
;;
(defun save-buffer-to-load-file (fname)
    (let ((ts (buffer-substring-no-properties (point-min) (point-max))))
      (write-region (point-min) (point-max) fname)))

In Applescript:


tell application "R"
    activate
    tell application "System Events"
        tell process "R"
            tell window 1
                keystroke "source('/tmp/tmp.R')"
                keystroke return
            end tell
        end tell
    end tell
end tell

John, 

I don't have enough time to provide a complete (or even clever) solution,
but I can offer some tips and hints, based on R.app 1.21-pre (devel 4746)
with R 2.5.1 on OS X 10.4.10.

To start, have a look at R.app's AppleScript dictionary, and study the
object hierarchies and properties, if you haven't already. No guarantees,
though, dictionaries are known to be among of the weaker parts of
AppleScriptable applications.

Next tip: The following stub works, if you have to address a specific window

tell application "R"
  set nn to (get every window whose name contains "Con")
  return properties of item 1 of nn -- just to demonstrate what happens
end tell

Note the 'every window' part, and note that you get a list returned, so you
have to use 'item # of' when you use 'nn'. May be also useful if you have
code that has to loop through a bunch of Quartz windows.

Sourcing files in R via AS is best done if you follow this pattern:

tell application "R"
  set thisFile to "POSIX-style/path/to/your/file"
  cmd "source( file=\"" & thisFile & "\")"
end tell

This works even in cases when the console isn't the active window; you don't
send the 'cmd' to the console window, the application itself is your target.
And note that you have to escape some of the quotation marks when you
assemble the 'source'-cmd.
I'm not sure if you have to use all the system events stuff, and you can
possibly omit the 'activate' command, too. Depends on the needs of your
workflow, I'd say. 

I'd also suggest to make use of try-on error-end try statements

tell application "R"
  try
    set thisFile to "POSIX-style/path/to/your/file"
    cmd "source( file=\"" & thisFile & "\")"
  on error
      -- do something to address an error
  end try
end tell


Hope this helps, happy scripting ;-)

John,

In textmate, below line is used:

osascript -e 'tell application "R.app" to activate' -e "tell  
application \"R.app\" to cmd \"source(file='$TM_FILEPATH',  
print.eval=TRUE)\""

I used similar constructs for SubEthaEdit and Smultron in AppleScript.

Try using tell **application**.

Rob

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] linked libraries?
Message-ID: <Pine.OSX.4.62.0709102335460.21223@paul-rathouzs-computer.local>

I am writing some Fortran programs to be linked into R using
dyn.load() and .Fortran().  I am using R CMD SHLIB to compile and
link.  In my code, a few of the subroutines that I am using are from
LINPACK/BLAS.  I am not sure if they are the same versions as those
used by R.  As an example, I might issue:

local% R CMD SHLIB testwrite.f dmattool.f linpack.f 
g77   -fno-common  -g -O2 -c testwrite.f -o testwrite.o
g77   -fno-common  -g -O2 -c dmattool.f -o dmattool.o
g77   -fno-common  -g -O2 -c linpack.f -o linpack.o
gcc-3.3 -bundle -flat_namespace -undefined suppress -L/usr/local/lib
-o testwrite.so testwrite.o dmattool.o linpack.o
-L/usr/local/lib/gcc/powerpc-apple-darwin6.8/3.4.2 -lg2c -lSystem
-lcc_dynamic -F/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/.. -framework R
local%

where linpack.f contains the BLAS subroutines I am using.  That is all
fine.  However, if I modify testwrite.f to call Fortran subroutines
RWARN or DBLEPR which are part of the R package and used for sending
warnings and printing back to R, then I get:

local% R CMD SHLIB testwrite.f dmattool.f linpack.f
g77   -fno-common  -g -O2 -c testwrite.f -o testwrite.o
g77   -fno-common  -g -O2 -c dmattool.f -o dmattool.o
g77   -fno-common  -g -O2 -c linpack.f -o linpack.o
gcc-3.3 -bundle -flat_namespace -undefined suppress -L/usr/local/lib
-o testwrite.so testwrite.o dmattool.o linpack.o
-L/usr/local/lib/gcc/powerpc-apple-darwin6.8/3.4.2 -lg2c -lSystem

[rest deleted]

That is, the compiler/linker (g77, gcc) must be linking in some BLAS
routines as a result of calling RWARN or DBLEPR.  The program still
seems to run fine, but what is the best way to handle this situation?
Can I just drop my file linpack.f and link in the BLAS routines
directly?  If so, how do I do that and know exactly what versions of
the routines are being linked in by SHLIB?  Alternatively, is there
someway to avoid the duplication of symbol names?  Or, is the whole
thing just harmless?

Paul,

as long as the routines are the same, it is quite harmless. However,  
in your case the other competing routines are from vecLib, so you  
never know. You may try to use vecLib directly (-framework vecLib) or  
even better use LAPACK_LIBS and BLAS_LIBS flags from R, e.g.:

R CMD SHLIB a.f '${LAPACK_LIBS} ${BLAS_LIBS}'

I can't reproduce your problem with the current R and gfortran, so  
I'm hoping you're using your own corresponding R binary for your  
compiler. I don't have gcc 3 machine anymore, so good luck..

Cheers,
Simon

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Tiny range bug
Message-ID: <CA50B123-E6DF-4F90-A1D5-526A0DFDE8B4@mac.com>

Hi,

I have a small function defined as such since I like to open windows  
by specifying sizes in pixels rather than inches:

quartz2 = function (w = 360, h = 360) {
	px2in = 5/360 # pixels to inches
	quartz(width = w * px2in, height = h * px2in)
}

This works fine. I accidentally typed this at one point:

 > quartz(h=120, w=600)

and got this error:

I'm guessing it's not happy to create a window that 600 inches wide.  
Probably not something that anyone's likely to come across, but I  
thought I'd send in a report.

Message-ID: <p06240803c31311aeb305@[165.124.162.75]>

Hi,

The packages polycor and Rgraphviz have a bus error (and R crash) 
when running their examples under 2.6.0 alpha.  They both work 
perfectly well with 2.5.1.


I have written John Fox about polycor and he reports that it works 
fine for Windows XP with R 2.6.0 alpha and suggests it is a Mac 2.6.0 
problem.

Good luck and thanks for such a wonderful interface to such a 
wonderful program.

For Rgraphviz we need to know what version of Graphviz you are using  
and how you installed it.

John,
    I have been testing out R2.6.0 alpha to see if my psych package 
works.   I am running the R Gui for the Mac.

There seems to be a problem with the polychor function in your 
polycor package.  I think this might be a general problem with R 
2.6.0 alpha  but I am not sure.  I am copying the R mac list to see 
if this is a general problem with the alpha gui.

Bill

Dear Bill,

This works fine for me under Windows XP with R 2.6.0 alpha, so I suspect a
problem with the Mac build:

plychr> set.seed(12345)

Bill,

Using R-2.6.0 alpha, the binary version of the package (for 2.6.0) of  
polycor seems to work fine. See below.

Don't think the version of the R GUI makes a difference here.

Regards,
Rob

   Has anyone noticed that the problem (whatever it is)
seems to occur in code from the included mvtnorm
package (specifically the guts of the
mvt() function), *not* the polycor package?

Jan and Kasper,


I am running Mac OS X 10.4.10

R  framework  installed directly from  CRAN (ucla mirror) (i.e., I 
did not compile it, I just installed the framework and GUI).

polycor reinstalled from CRAN   (version 0.7.3)
also similar failure when using Rgraphviz  1.15.9
Rgraphviz installed from bioconductor using the  commands

source("http://bioconductor.org/getBioC.R")
biocLite <- function(pkgs, groupName="lite", ...)
     if (missing(pkgs))
         biocinstall(groupName=groupName, ...)
     else
         biocinstall(pkgs=pkgs, groupName=groupName, ...)
}
biocLite("Rgraphviz")

  At least that solves the polychor problem.  You are right.
I tried it with just the mvtnorm package and the error occurs.

Ok, I made it go away.

Following Ben's hint, I reinstalled mvtnorm  from CRAN and polychor 
works perfectly again.

For Rgraphviz, I had not loaded one of the dependencies for graph, 
and although graph did not object, it just crashed.

With a reinstalled mvtnorm,  and Rgraphviz and graph and ..., 
everything works beautifully.

Thanks.  I was unaccustomed to having such an ungraceful exit 
compared to the normal set of warnings.   But that is what happens 
when you try out an alpha release.

Bill

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] First time installation problem
Message-ID: <46F82A2C.60809@gmail.com>

Hello all.  I am a new Mac user and am having a problem installing R.  I 
am running OX 10.3.9 on an IMac G3 with 3.9 GB free on my hard drive and 
am trying to install v 2.2.0.

Everything goes fine until I get to the "Custom Install on Hard Drive" 
window.  I get 4 package names listed: R Framework, R GUI for Mac OS X, 
tcl/tk 8.4.10 for X11, and GNU Fortran 3.4.2.  But under Action, all the 
package have Skip listed and under Size 0 bytes.  The install button is 
not highlighted so I am stymied.

I have been a Windows user for years.  Any help appreciated.
Jeff

The binaries from CRAN only works with OSX 10.4.4 and higher (as it  
"clearly" says on the download page). You will probably need to  
compile from source.

Jeff,
   Go to http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/old/
and scroll down to the powerpc/R-2-2.1.dmg    This is a binary that 
will work on 10.3.9

The newer releases of R and the R-GUI that are precompiled require 10.4.4
As Kasper says, if you want a newer release you will need to compile 
from source, but the older version will work "right out of the box."

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] 'Save as PDF' window won't go away
Message-ID: <C3159603.13EA5%ken.williams@thomson.com>

Hi,

In R.app, when I bring a Quartz window to the foreground and choose "Save
As..." from the File menu, I can save the window successfully.  But when I
switch to another application and back to R.app, the window with title "Save
Content of Quartz Device to PDF file" is back, and can't be dismissed.  Its
"Save" button is greyed-out, and its close button in the upper-left corner
is also greyed-out.

The only way I seem to be able to make this window go away is to quit R.app.

Well I was a bit fast here, as Jeff actually wrote he was trying to  
install R-2.2.0. So I have no idea why it does not work. The obvious  
thing to do is to try with R-2.2.1 which is the newest version for OS  
X 10.3.9. But I have no idea if it will work.

If I download the R-2.2.0 installer, it does not report sizes of 0  
MBs for the various components under Tiger (although I never actually  
did the install - but it looked ok).

Can you install the packages individually by going into the packages  
directory?

If possible, I would suggest upgrading to Tiger.

Ken,

If you re-install the GUI, version 4773 from Simon's web site  
( http://r.research.att.com/ ), it should be fixed.

Let me know if this helps,

If you use svn you can use 'svn log | more' or at the NEWS file in  
the source
distribution.

Thanks, that indeed seems to do the trick.

Is there a change log somewhere (besides in the repo, which I'm actually not
sure where to find) that shows what's changed between pre-release versions?

Thanks, but where can I find the SVN repo?  I couldn't find a reference to
it on http://r.research.att.com/ , the only reference to SVN I could find
there is for how to get the latest sources for gcc.

I've just put together an RSS feed of changes to the NEWS and CHANGES 
files in R.  I'd be happy to add the Mac R GUI changelog, if it could be 
reformatted into a format that readNEWS() can understand (or if readNEWS 
were improved to be able to read it...)

For now, the RSS feed is at 
http://developer.r-project.org/bloxsom.cgi/index.rss (leave off the 
index.rss for the full list).  The URL and format are likely to change.

Hi Ken,

Actually, much simpler, the NEWS file is available under the Help  
menu of the GUI.

Ken,

Of course it is publicly available: svn co https://svn.R-project.org/ 
R-packages/trunk/Mac-GUI Mac-GUI

You will have to install subversion, e.g. from: http://metissian.com/ 
projects/macosx/subversion/

You need permission to commit, but above command will create a dir  
'Mac-GUI' with an Xcode.proj file.

In the Mac-GUI dir, after the initial copy, you can just do 'svn up'  
to update.

Regards,
Rob

I'm getting the impression that the SVN repository is not publicly
available, is that the case?  If so that's fine, but if it is available I'm
still interested to know where it is so I can poke around at things when I'm
curious.

Thanks,

FWIW, you can access files directly without subversion, e.g. the most  
current NEWS file is always at
https://svn.r-project.org/R-packages/trunk/Mac-GUI/NEWS

Cheers,
Simon

Message-ID: <C7F35AEB-24F0-4DAC-8217-11A410B023F3@muohio.edu>

Hi Folks,
I am using R 2.5.1

I would like to have my quartz devices open by default somewhere  
other than in the center of the screen, perhaps the lower right  
corner, for instance.

I have not been able to find anything about positioning this display  
in any of the documentation, but I swear I have seen it somewhere. My  
current .Rprofile contains this:

.....
library(CarbonEL)
Sys.setenv("DISPLAY"="0.0:0 R")
options(device="quartz")
.....

Any tips or pointers are appreciated.

Thanks,
Hank

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] package compilation failure
Message-ID: <20070925100822.GA2991@elhalyn>


Hi all.

I've recently uploaded a package to CRAN. It build fine on both
Linux (32 and 64 bit) and Windows, but fails on MacOSX because
of C90 vs C99 issues:

http://www.r-project.org/nosvn/R.check/r-patched-macosx-ix86/bnlearn-00install.html

Since I've no MacOSX machine at hand, I would like to ask you:
why C99 is not the default for gcc on MacOSX? Is it safe to force
gcc to use C99 with either -std=c99 o -std=gnu99?

Thanks in advance.

Is it old news that the scroll bar in the editor does not calculate

I doubt that this is a bug, but the FAQ page suggests emailing to this list.

I have previously run R 2.5.1 without difficulty on this platform.

When launching the aqua version, it now crashes every time with the same
error message. I have updated to the latest version of Xcode Tools and
downloaded and reinstalled R. It still crashes.

I can run R from the X11 window command line.

Any thoughts?

Nathan

In the R editor, after 99 lines, the line numbers don't fit. Is this  
my copy or is the how it is right now?

Cheers,

It seems that the left frame which contains the numbers is too narrow.

You can adjust the width of the margin in the Preferences for more  
digits to become visible.

This is probably me being obtuse but having upgraded to R 2.5.1 - GUI  
1.20 (4535) (4535) and when I start up I get

The only other quirk seems to be an inability to close a save quartz

have any suggestions I'd welcome them
