Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] R64.app Won't Launch on 10.5.8 with a G5
Message-ID: <7A5B6889-84B3-4C0B-B447-7FA95518105F@gmail.com>

Hello all,

Is R64.app not backward compatible with 10.5 on a PPC64 machine? Does it only work if 10.5 is launched in 64 bit mode? 

Thanks,
Sean

Sorry, forgot to add, it's R version 2.11.0 with GUI 1.33.

Thanks again,

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Universal R 2.11.0 for with R.app GUI 1.33 released on 2010/04/27
This binary distribution of R and the GUI supports PowerPC (32-bit) and Intel (32-bit and 64-bit) based Macs on Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard) and 10.6 (Snow Leopard).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Only 32-bit is now built and supported for PPC.

OS X 10.5 is always 64-bit.  

The issue is that 64-bit PPC software/compilers and Apple
support are slowly disappearing as time goes on.  Simon Urbanek
and others that develop and maintain R for the Mac announced
a while back that PPC64 support would end, as the PPC platform
is becoming history.  So, it's either compile R and packages
from source in 64-bit mode yourself, or get a new Intel-based Mac.

Something is wrong with your system software.  On my Leopard box:

tystie% otool -L 
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/modules/i386/R_X11.so
...
 	/usr/X11/lib/libpng12.0.dylib (compatibility version 42.0.0, 
current version 42.0.0)

So your /usr/X11/lib/libpng12.0.dylib is different from mine (and from 
the CRAN build machine's).

Your choices are

- to resolve this (and it is not an R issue). I'd start by running the 
software updater ....

- to build R from the sources against the software on your machine.

Hi,
Perhaps a little bug in R64 GUI ?

Menu: Packages&Data-->DataManager

send the following message :
******************************************
Erreur dans help(dt[i], package = pkg[i], htmlhelp = TRUE) : 
  argument(s) inutilis?(s) (htmlhelp = TRUE)
De plus : Messages d'avis :
1: In data(package = .packages(all.available = TRUE)) :
  datasets have been moved from package 'base' to package 'datasets'
2: In data(package = .packages(all.available = TRUE)) :
  datasets have been moved from package 'stats' to package 'datasets'
********************************************
I use the following version (but I get the same message with the CRAN 2.11 release)
R version 2.11.0 Patched (2010-05-01 r51890)
on a Mac OS 10.6.3 macbookpro intel core2duo

Sincerely,

Fr?d?ric

Perhaps you can try Xquartz 2.5 from xquartz.macosforge.org and see if the updated X11 package works better.

I am running Mac OS X 10.6.3 and R 2.10.1 patched.

> sessionInfo()
R version 2.10.1 Patched (2010-04-07 r51689) 
x86_64-apple-darwin9.8.0 

Result of  otool -L /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/modules/i386/R_X11.so
on my machine is:
...
	/usr/X11/lib/libpng12.0.dylib (compatibility version 36.0.0, current version 36.0.0)

which I assume will mean that running R2.11.0 will give error messages similar to those of the OP.
I have Apple's Xquartz 2.3.5 (xorg-server 1.4.2-apple53)(the latest from Apple for Snow Leopard, I think)
And I have not fiddled with X at all.

I just now also did (Mac OS X 10.6.3)

 otool -L /usr/X11/lib/libpng12.0.dylib

with result:

/usr/X11/lib/libpng12.0.dylib:
	/usr/X11/lib/libpng12.0.dylib (compatibility version 42.0.0, current version 42.0.0)
	/usr/lib/libz.1.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.2.3)
	/usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 125.0.1)

so things seem to be ok.
Something is indeed wrong with your X or something else.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Problem with X11
Message-ID: <932DEB60-EC02-4BDC-97F7-A766E17B0E77@yahoo.de>

Dear R- and MacUsers,

may be a totally disqualifying question, but I am stuck, because: I  
keep getting an Error about an X11 module, for example this:

Error in png(file = namepng, h = h * dpi, w = w * dpi) :
   X11 module cannot be loaded
In addition: Warning message:
In png(file = namepng, h = h * dpi, w = w * dpi) :
   unable to load shared library '/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/ 
Resources/modules/i386/R_X11.so':
   dlopen(/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/modules/i386/ 
R_X11.so, 6): Library not loaded: /usr/X11/lib/libpng12.0.dylib
   Referenced from: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/modules/ 
i386/R_X11.so
   Reason: Incompatible library version: R_X11.so requires version  
42.0.0 or later, but libpng12.0.dylib provides version 38.0.0

The problem only appeared recently (maybe after changing to 2.11.0,  
but I am not sure).

What do I have to do to get the required version of this library?

Thanks in advance,

Anna

If it's not part of the standard Mac OS X system, it comes in Apple Developer Tools.
You'll have to register in the Apple Developer program and download Xcode.
And I'm not sure if you can use the latest Xcode 3.2.2 on Snow Leopard.

It's probably a good idea to wait for a reaction from Simon who is the expert in these matters.

Which version of Mac OS X and X11 do you have? Neither of you have provided that information.

I can only second Brian's response. The build machine is a completely clean Mac OS X 10.5.8 (up to date with all recent security updates) - I have not installed any custom X11 updates. I don't know why Seth has an outdated libpng in the X11 installation. Seth, please make sure your system is up to date. Given the date of the last update I would suspect that  Software Update should resolve this issue (if that is the case it's nonetheless a little annoying that Apple's security update would break backward compatibility).

Cheers,
Simon

That's clear - but did you have your system up-to-date?

(Calling X11() did not really "crash" my machine. but it reported a  
serious error and asked me to save and restart.

otools reports my version in that directory is 36.0.0.

	/usr/X11/lib/libpng12.0.dylib (compatibility version 36.0.0, current  
version 36.0.0)

(Of course, it also lists about 10 other locations as well. Should I  
have posted the entire output? )

I install all updates when they are pushed. I just did a Software  
Update of my 10.5.8 machine and it says I am up-to-date.

Does it matter that I set a fairly long Sys.env path in my .Rprofile  
and that "/usr/X11/lib" is not in that path?

Sys.setenv(PATH="/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/sw/bin:/sw/sbin:/usr/ 
bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/texbin:/usr/X11/bin:/usr/ 
X11R6/bin")

For the record, I am not having problems with R or RGL which I believe  
requires X11 for some of its display. And capabilities() thinks I have  
X11:

     jpeg      png     tiff    tcltk      X11     aqua http/ftp

Hmm.. now the real question is why some Leopard systems have libpng12 version 36 and some have version 42. As I said the build machine has a pristine Leopard install, I did not install any custom X11 updates - it just has all security updates.

pkginfo reveals that the file has been last updated by the 2010 Leopard security update 02:

hagal:~$ pkgutil -v --file-info /usr/X11/lib/libpng12.0.dylib
     volume: /
       path: usr/X11/lib/libpng12.0.dylib

[...]
       pkgid: com.apple.pkg.update.security.2010.002.leopard
 pkg-version: 1.0.1.1191932192
install-time: Tue Apr 13 14:18:52 2010
         uid: 0 (root)
         gid: 0 (wheel)
        mode: 100755 (-rwxr-xr-x )

I would suggest installing the latest Leopard security upgrade by hand (if your Software Update really shows up-to-date system otherwise use System Update) - it also includes the 02 update which in turn includes the updated libpng:

http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1027

(This is for Mac OS X 10.5.8 client [=not server] *ONLY*)

No, it doesn't matter.

Thanks, Simon;

Just a note before I hit the restart button ... the package that is  
current is Security Update 2010-003 and my log files show that I  
already installed it on 4/16/2010. The log files do not have an entry  
for Security Update 2010-002.

(But 2010-003 does say it incorporates all previous updates.)

With the 2010-02 update installed you should see:

hagal:~$ ls -l /usr/X11/lib/libpng12.0.dylib 
-rwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  684448 Dec  7 23:33 /usr/X11/lib/libpng12.0.dylib

That matches the content of the update package:

ginaz:su$ lsbom SecUpd2010-003.pkg/Bom |grep /libpng12.0.d
./usr/X11/lib/libpng12.0.dylib	100755	0/0	684448	3378515879

So the update should really solve the issue.
FWIW the full output on the build machine:

hagal:~$ ls -l /usr/X11/lib/libpng12*dylib
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel      16 Apr 13 13:40 /usr/X11/lib/libpng12.0.24.0.dylib -> libpng12.0.dylib
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel      16 Apr 13 13:58 /usr/X11/lib/libpng12.0.35.0.dylib -> libpng12.0.dylib
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel      16 Apr 13 14:18 /usr/X11/lib/libpng12.0.41.0.dylib -> libpng12.0.dylib

Just as a side note - that is not a good idea - external docs are unfortunately very often wrong and/or out of date. Please consult canonical sources instead.

That is the wrong download for R 2.11.0 as you would see on the canonical page:

AFAICT this is just benign error from rattle/RGtk2 - it's probably trying to draw something before the window is ready. The stack trace is attached in case the maintainers want to have a look. It does not affect the usability AFAICT.

Again, this is merely a warning - GTK+ does produce spurious warnings quite regularly. This time I can't seem to be able to reproduce this one.

Hi,

Thanks for your insight. I got the GTK warning when I try to perform an action with the Rattle GUI (v2.5.30), for 
example loading data. The problem is that this error obviously prevents the program to run. I found many users 
reporting this issue but no one seems to have a clue.

You're certainly a very advanced user with some kind of custom 
install of R. As you can use rattle you should certainly have something I don't.

Cheers,
Morgan

AFAICT this is just 
benign error from rattle/RGtk2 - it's probably trying to draw something before the window is ready. The stack trace is 
attached in case the maintainers want to have a look. It does not affect the usability AFAICT.

Well I feel a little silly.  After running the software updater, R
works just fine.  Thanks for the assistance.

Simon, Morgan,

I have the latest version of Rattle, 2.5.30, correctly installed, I  
think, and running on R version 2.11.0 Patched (2010-05-01 r51879)  
under OS X 10.5.8.  I have the same problem as you, Morgan, i.e., the  
Gtk warning "Unable to find default local directory monitor type".   
Here is a run that provokes the message:

Hi,

I have the exact same problem here. 

I looked around and it seems that "rggobi" is a required dependency. I tried 
to install it different ways but it always fails:

* installing *source* package ?rggobi? ...
checking for pkg-
config... no
checking for GGOBI... configure: error: The pkg-config script could not be found or is too old.  Make sure 
it
is in your PATH or set the PKG_CONFIG environment variable to the full
path to pkg-config.

Alternatively, you may 
set the environment variables GGOBI_CFLAGS
and GGOBI_LIBS to avoid the need to call pkg-config.
See the pkg-config man 
page for more details.

To get pkg-config, see <http://pkg-config.freedesktop.org/>.See `config.log' for more details.
ERROR: configuration 
failed for package ?rggobi?
* removing ?/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.11/Resources/library/rggobi?

Les 
packages t?l?charg?s sont dans

That's where I am...so far

Morgan

Message-ID: <BD3A0C4E-D6EF-4BB8-87D6-463B2D8A424E@remoteinformation.com.au>

G'day all,

I'm posting this question here (to avoid cross-posting, and because the error messages I have come from the Mac Crash reporter) but I'm happy to move it across to another list.

When I run some queries, there are errors, and I get a message back, such as this:

> q<-'SELECT s.name as species, r.name as purpose, o.name as origin, d.name as destination, count(m.id) FROM movements m LEFT OUTER JOIN commodities c ON m.id = c.movementid LEFT OUTER JOIN species s ON c.commodity = s.id LEFT OUTER JOIN reasons r ON c.purpose = r.id LEFT OUTER JOIN locations o on originprovince like o.hiercode and o.level = 2 and o.del = 0 LEFT OUTER JOIN locations d on destinationprovince like d.hiercode and d.level = 2 and d.del =0  GROUP BY s.shortname, r.name, o.name, d.name order by count(m.id) DESC, s.shortname, r.name limit 20;'
> big.moves <- dbGetQuery(db,q)
Error in postgresqlExecStatement(conn, statement, ...) : 
  RS-DBI driver: (could not Retrieve the result : ERROR:  column "s.name" must appear in the GROUP BY clause or be used in an aggregate function
LINE 1: SELECT s.name as species, r.name as purpose, o.name as origi...
               ^
)
Warning message:
In postgresqlQuickSQL(conn, statement, ...) :
  Could not create executeSELECT s.name as species, r.name as purpose, o.name as origin, d.name as destination, count(m.id) FROM movements m LEFT OUTER JOIN commodities c ON m.id = c.movementid LEFT OUTER JOIN species s ON c.commodity = s.id LEFT OUTER JOIN reasons r ON c.purpose = r.id LEFT OUTER JOIN locations o on originprovince like o.hiercode and o.level = 2 and o.del = 0 LEFT OUTER JOIN locations d on destinationprovince like d.hiercode and d.level = 2 and d.del =0  GROUP BY s.shortname, r.name, o.name, d.name order by count(m.id) DESC, s.shortname, r.name limit 20;

with a corresponding entry in the pgsql log. If I fix it, it appears to be fine, but if I had instead tried : (In this case the order by clause has a different column)

q<-'SELECT s.shortname as species, r.name as purpose, o.name as origin, d.name as destination, count(m.id) FROM movements m LEFT OUTER JOIN commodities c ON m.id = c.movementid LEFT OUTER JOIN species s ON c.commodity = s.id LEFT OUTER JOIN reasons r ON c.purpose = r.id LEFT OUTER JOIN locations o on originprovince like o.hiercode and o.level = 2 and o.del = 0 LEFT OUTER JOIN locations d on destinationprovince like d.hiercode and d.level = 2 and d.del =0  GROUP BY s.shortname, r.name, o.name, d.name ORDER BY count(m.id) DESC, s.name, r.name limit 20'
big.moves <- dbGetQuery(db,q)


If I run the query in psql, it gives me the error message. If I check the pgsql log, it reports the message, but then an unexpected EOF:

2010-05-06 16:58:59 WSTSTATEMENT:  SELECT s.shortname as species, r.name as purpose, o.name as origin, d.name as destination, count(m.id) FROM movements m LEFT OUTER JOIN commodities c ON m.id = c.movementid LEFT OUTER JOIN species s ON c.commodity = s.id LEFT OUTER JOIN reasons r ON c.purpose = r.id LEFT OUTER JOIN locations o on originprovince like o.hiercode and o.level = 2 and o.del = 0 LEFT OUTER JOIN locations d on destinationprovince like d.hiercode and d.level = 2 and d.del =0  GROUP BY s.shortname, r.name, o.name, d.name order by count(m.id) DESC, s.name, r.name limit 20
2010-05-06 16:58:59 WSTLOG:  unexpected EOF on client connection
 
And the crash log is below.

I don't really know where the error is - it seems that the postgresql process is returning an error, but R or DBI or My Mac are not happy with it. Am I in the right forum, or should I be in another one? Obviously, I could just get my queries right, or test each one first in psql... but the behaviour is still very undesirable.

Final Note - this happens in both GUI and terminal app


cheers

Ben

The help system seems completely broken from 2.10.0 (GUI 1.30)  
onwards: selecting 'R help' from the help menu produces a blank  
screen. I am running OS X 10.5.8.

Thanks, Jon.

Jon,

I'm having no problems with 2.10.1 and GUI 1.32 (albeit on 10.6.3) - you might want to try upgrading. I had downloaded this one from http://r.research.att.com/, but I also note that 2.11.0 is now the current release.

> sessionInfo()
R version 2.10.1 Patched (2010-02-01 r51089) 
x86_64-apple-darwin9.8.0 

cheers

Ben

FWIW I don't think \d is a basic regexp so as I would expect the perl mode to work and it does:

> test2<-"aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa12345WWWWWWWWWWWWW"
> sub(".*(\\d{5}).*", "\\1", test2,perl=TRUE)
[1] "12345"

Yet I agree that if should either fail (i.e. return the unmodified string) or return 12345.

Also note that the bug is locale-specific:

LANG=C R

>  test2<-"aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa12345WWWWWWWWWWWWW"
> sub(".*(\\d{5}).*", "\\1", test2,perl=TRUE)
[1] "12345"
> sub(".*(\\d{5}).*", "\\1", test2)
[1] "12345"

Also note that this is not Mac-specific:

>  test2<-"aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa12345WWWWWWWWWWWWW"
>  sub(".*(\\d{5}).*", "\\1", test2)
[1] "WWWWW"
> system("uname -sr")
Linux 2.6.32-trunk-amd64

Cheers,
Simon

Two Q's:
A) Is this supposed to happen with perl-mode?:

 > test<-"</tr><tr><th>88958</th><th>Abcdsef</th><th>67.8S</ 
th><th>68.9\nW</th><th>26m</th>"

[1] "88958\nW</th><th>26m</th>"

Looks to me that a period is being improperly recognized.

B) With regard to the default (which I read to be  extended rather  
than basic) vs. perl-like, the Extended section of the regex  
documentation contains:

" Symbols \d, \s, \D and \S denote the digit and space classes and  
their negations."

Nope - perl does take EOL into account so .* will be matched only to the end of line. For your purposes you want to enable ?s option, so you probably meant:

> sub("(?s).*(\\d{5}).*", "\\1", test, perl=TRUE)
[1] "88958"

Yes, you're right - extended is the default.

Hi,

A short recap (Rattle still not working):

- Installed GTK from http://r.research.att.com/- Installed GGOBI
- Installed R latest
- Finally installed rggobi 
2.1.14 from BioConductor Bin (can load it without error as well)
- Installed rattle with dependencies

Rattle not 
rattling, still this damn warning: R:2547): Gtk-WARNING **: Unable to find default local directory monitor type (see 
Richard post for the detail)

Cheers,
Morgan

Hi,

I have the exact same problem here. 

I looked around and it 
seems that "rggobi" is a required dependency. I tried 
to install it different ways but it always fails:

* installing 
*source* package ?rggobi? ...
checking for pkg-
config... no
checking for GGOBI... configure: error: The pkg-config 
script could not be found or is too old.  Make sure 
it
is in your PATH or set the PKG_CONFIG environment variable to 
the full
path to pkg-config.

Alternatively, you may 
set the environment variables GGOBI_CFLAGS
and GGOBI_LIBS to 
avoid the need to call pkg-config.
See the pkg-config man 
page for more details.

To get pkg-config, see <http://pkg-config.freedesktop.org/>.See`config.log' for more details.
ERROR: configuration

Simon, Morgan,

I have the latest version of 
Rattle, 
2.5.30, correctly installed, I  
think, and running on R version 2.11.0 Patched (2010-05-01 r51879)  
under OS 
X 
10.5.8.  I have the same problem as you, Morgan, i.e., the  
Gtk warning "Unable to find default local directory 

monitor type".   
Here is a run that provokes the message:

Great update....

I finally manager to get rattle working... I still have the GTK warnings but rattle works !!! Despite 
the language of my system is set to english, it was the clue.

Here's the detailed and working procedure for Mac OSX 
and R2.11

0) Make sure X11 is installed (if not install it from your restore DVDs)
1) Install latest GTK from GTK_2.
18.5-X11.pkg (http://r.research.att.com/libs/GTK_2.18.5-X11.pkg
2) Install GGOBI from http://www.ggobi.org/downloads/ggobi-2.1.8.dmg3) Install R from http://www.r-project.org/(I also 
installed gfortran-4.2.3.dmg and tcltk-8.5.5-x11.dmg)
4) Launch R
5) Quit R (4&5 create the R preference plist used in 
6)
6) Launch terminal and execute: defaults write org.R-project.R force.LANG en_US.UTF-8
7) Launch R and
> install.
packages("rattle", dependencies=c("Depends", "Suggests"))
8) Start up Rattle

Test on my 
two mac running 10.6.3. Does it work for you guys too?

Morgan

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] LaTeX errors when creating PDF version
Message-ID: <4BE32C95.5000206@aon.at>

Dear all,

On my Leopard machine I have installed LateX using i-Installer II from 
http://www.rna.nl/ii.html (which should now be replaced by 
http://ii2.sourceforge.net/ in Mac OS X FAQ).

In contrast, after upgrading my Tiger machine to Snow Leopard I have 
installed MacTeX (both BasicTeX.dmg and MacTeX-Additions-2009.mpkg).

Both machines are Intel MacBook Pro.

Then I did run R CMD check of the identical package xps_1.9.1.tar.gz on 
both machines:

On the Leopard machine everything works fine, I can create the vignettes 
and other files w/o any error or warning message.

In contrast, on the Snow Leopard machine R CMD check results in the 
LaTeX errors shown below. Interestingly, R CMD check creates the 
pdf-files of all vignettes anyhow.

Does anyone know what the reason for this may be and what I need to do 
to get rid of these messages?

Best regards
Christian

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] LaTeX errors when creating PDF version
In-Reply-To: <4BE32C95.5000206@aon.at>
References: <4BE32C95.5000206@aon.at>

Dear all,

I just realized that the problem is not creation of the vignettes but 
creation of "xps-manual.pdf". Below I list part of the messages I get 
from "xps-maual.log".

Do you know what the problem might be?

Best regards
Christian

I wasn't able to read the size data for this font,
so I will ignore the font specification.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] The libpng12.0.dylib hoo-hah.
Message-ID: <BA522D7E-3F2C-4934-85DC-2452F60C9804@auckland.ac.nz>


I just upgraded to R version 2.11.0 (to try to solve a problem with
install.packages).  That problem was duly solved, but a new problem
was introduced --- X11 no longer works with R.

I am aware of a substantial discourse on this issue, on this mailing
list.  As far as I can make out --- a lot of the discourse leaves me
bewildered --- the issue boils down to my machine having an out-of-date
version of libpng12.0.dylib.  This is in fact what the error message
tells me when I try to start X11().

My reading of the discourse appears to me to indicate that I should
be able to remedy the problem by running System Update.  I found the
menu item for that and clicked on it.  I got a pop-up window listing
the software for which updates are available.  None seems to have
anything to do with X11 or with libpng12.0.dylib.  I have attached
a screen shot of this pop-up window in pdf format.

One item that I guess might have some impact is for the whole operating
system!  The item says that Mac OS X 10.6.3 is available.  (I'm currently
running 10.6.2.)  I hesitate to try this, since I'm not sure what other
difficulties would result from so doing.  And I'm not sure how long it
would take.  Hours?  And doesn't one have to ***pay*** for OS updates?

So can anyone suggest how I might get the appropriate up-to-date version
of libpng12.0.dylib in place on my system?

When I do ls -l /usr/X11/lib/libpng12*dylib (as was
suggested in the postings on this issue) the results are:

> lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel      16 28 Jan 15:07 /usr/X11/lib/libpng12.0.35.0.dylib@ -> libpng12.0.dylib
> -rwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  436848  6 Jul  2009 /usr/X11/lib/libpng12.0.dylib*
> lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel      16 28 Jan 15:07 /usr/X11/lib/libpng12.dylib@ -> libpng12.0.dylib

Thanks for any solace and advice.

	cheers,

		Rolf Turner

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Building AEM on PPC G3 running MacOS X 10.4
Message-ID: <CD447C85-92AA-4470-9DB0-DBED286C70B6@vcn.bc.ca>

I am setting up ordination packages on my R platform and have  
questions for installing the PCNM package. I am running an older  
platform: iBook G3 (PPC processor), Mac OS 10.4.11, with R ver.  
2.10.1 (installed from universal binary). I also have X-Code (ver.  
3.4) installed. I tried to build some of the packages in the Darwin  
terminal and run into some problems with AEM installation via the  
PCNM compilation:

 From a previous attempt to install PCNM (before I installed XCode),  
I ran into these errors:

Rolf,

I have no expertise in X11, and can use it (I don't normally, it seems much slower than quartz) the most technical thing I have done is install R installation using the installer from r.research.att.com but if it helps you in a moment of desparation!

I am running 10.6.3 - Apple updates routinely seem to include all sorts of very small tweaks and updates here and there. I don't really understand why my sessionInfo() output is the same as yours - x86_64-apple-darwin9.8.0.

at 438 MB I guess you could argue that you have to pay, especially if you are not on broadband. But you don't have to pay anything to Apple for the minor digit upgrades ( ie 10.6.2 -> 10.6.3)

I have it - no idea where it came from , but I'd try the upgrade as you have identified. In fact I seem to have all the following:

libpng.3.35.0.dylib
libpng.3.41.0.dylib
libpng.3.dylib
libpng.dylib
libpng12.0.35.0.dylib
libpng12.0.41.0.dylib
libpng12.0.dylib
libpng12.dylib


I hope this is some help.

cheers

Ben

Dear Ben,

Thanks for your email.  I guess I'll try the OS upgrade as you suggested,
unless I get other suggestions in the near future.  I fear and tremble at
thought however.  Something is sure to go wrong (Murphy's Law being what
it is).

	cheers,

		Rolf

There is no Xcode 3.4 to my knowledge, and certainly not for 10.4. 
Perhaps you meant 2.4, in which case you need to update it.  From 
memory (we no longer support Tiger binaries) Xcode 2.4.1 is needed and 
2.5 is the last version for Tiger.

Alterntively (and better), build R 2.11.0 from the sources on your 
machine.

That is not recommended on Mac OS X, and everywhere we recommend you 
first use build (not build --binary) to make a tarball, then INSTALL 
it.  For how to package Mac OS X binary packages, see that FAQ.

Rolf, please look at the archives - this has been discussed here[1] at length and updating your OS (including the security updates) solves this.
Cheers,

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Error creating Reference Manual for R-packages with
	MacTeX
Message-ID: <4BE44F1B.7040609@aon.at>

Dear all,

After a fresh installation of Snow Leopard I have installed the smaller 
distribution of MacTeX (BasicTeX.dmg and MacTeX-Additions-2009.mpkg) 
from: http://www.tug.org/mactex/2009/morepackages.html

While this version of MacTeX is able to create pdf-files for the 
vignettes R CMD check fails to create pdf-files for the Reference 
Manuals. To make sure that this is not a problem of my package only I 
have tested this with the following packages:
DynDoc_1.26.0.tar.gz
externalVector_1.14.0.tar.gz
gpls_1.20.0.tar.gz
Icens_1.20.0.tar.gz
preprocessCore_1.10.0.tar.gz
xps_1.9.0.tar.gz

As the different Rdlatex.log reveal, the problem is always the same:
kpathsea: Running mktexmf pcrr8t
! I can't find file `pcrr8t'.

For example the relevant output of "R CMD check DynDoc_1.26.0.tar.gz" is:

* checking PDF version of manual ... WARNING
LaTeX errors when creating PDF version.
This typically indicates Rd problems.
LaTeX errors found:
! Font T1/pcr/m/n/10=pcrr8t at 10.0pt not loadable: Metric (TFM) file

l.109 \begin{ExampleCode}

* checking PDF version of manual without index ... ERROR


Below I attach the complete output of Rdlatex.log for R CMD check DynDoc.

Since doing a Google search did not reveal any helpful information my 
question is:

Is there any file missing from BasicTeX which I need to install?
(According to the web-site "BasicTeX contains all of the standard tools 
needed to write TeX documents...")

Thank you in advance.
Best regards
Christian

Since David Winsemius was so kind to send me a private mail showing his 
output of "locate pcrr8t" for TeXworks I was finally able to solve the 
problem.

For the records and others who have installed only BasicTeX:

The problem is that BasicTeX installs only the Adobe 'times' font but 
not 'courier'. For this reason I had to install package 'courier' (and 
'helvetic') using 'TeX Live Utility.app'

Vishy,

This is the problem that if the workspace is saved, R (R itself, not R.app) also saves a history file, typically with the name .Rhistory. This file is empty and overwrites an R.app history file with the same name. I suggest to change the R.app history filename (in Startup preferences) to something like .Rosxhistory or Rosxhistory or ~/Rosxhistory).

Regards,
Rob

Yes, renaming the history file fixes the problem! Now I recall that
I'd encountered this issue a long time and this may have been the
solution that was suggested, but I think I had lost and recreated my R
preferences file between OS upgrades and R upgrades.
Thanks for the help!
V.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Building AEM on PPC G3 running MacOS X 10.4
Message-ID: <7376A515-8BC3-4C02-B11B-AA2E677B05E5@mail.mcgill.ca>

I am setting up ordination packages on my R platform and have  
questions for installing the PCNM package. I am running an older  
platform: iBook G3 (PPC processor), Mac OS 10.4.11, with R ver.  
2.10.1 (installed from universal binary). I also have X-Code (ver.  
3.4) installed. I tried to build some of the packages in the Darwin  
terminal and run into some problems with AEM installation via the  
PCNM compilation:

 From a previous attempt to install PCNM (before I installed XCode),  
I ran into these errors:

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Perplexed benchmark result from a new Macbook Pro Core
	i5
Message-ID: <5E4E1FFF-48D5-4F08-801C-26254C52DB04@me.com>

I was just replacing a Macbook Pro from 2008 (with a 2.2GHz Intel Core 2 Duo) with a new Macbook Pro (with a 2.4GHz Intel Core i5). To get a rough idea about the difference in R execution speed I ran a small test, with the output shown below. In short:

1) The new Macbook Pro was ca 60% _slower_ at linear algebra (crossprod() and solve())
2) The new Macbook Pro was ca 17% faster on a long for-loop
3) Linking against Goto2 versus vecLib improved the linear algebra results slightly

Both test were done using the same 2.11.0 dmg image from CRAN. 

Any thoughts on this? 

Any ideas how I can improve the performance results? What about compiling from source?


Thanks,
Gardar Johannesson

What OS X versions are on the respective machines? The vecLib performance varies greatly with their versions.

Note that you are essentially just comparing the BLAS libraries on each machine, R is practically not involved in this at all, so if you meant R in the "compiling from source" then the answer is likely no (R speed is what you see in the loops).


I don't have an i5 arounds, but comparing similar architectures (Penryn vs Nehalem) gives a slight edge to Nehalem (3.8s @ 2.8GHz vs 3.4s @ 2.66Ghz on solve(B)) but that is for a Xeon so the memory speed may be the edge (everything on OS X 10.6.3).

Cheers,
Simon

I did the same test on a MBP 15 i7 2.66GHz. The results follows. This is for x86_64 version, the i386 version (aka R32) is slightly slower than this.

Just a thought: Wouldn't it make more sense to compare the "elapsed"  
times, which show that both machines are more or less equally fast  
(with a slide edge for the newer i5)?

I suspect that there is a change in the way "user" time is reported,  
which probably adds up running times of four hyperthreads running on  
two cores for the i5 CPU vs. only two threads on two cores for the  
Core 2 Duo.  If I'm not mistaken about the i5 architecture, this is  
not surprising: there are 4 threads, but they have to share 2 cores  
and don't seem to be able to run the FP instructions in parallel on a  
single core; so they're running at half speed only.

Thanks for the benchmark, by the way.  It's good to know I'm not  
missing out on R performance with my good old 2008 MacBook Pro. :-)

Cheers,
Stefan

Oh my - how could I miss that :) Stefan, you're right - the elapsed is indeed shorter on the i5 so ATLAS simply spreads some part across threads without any gain (unsurprising on such small tasks). I got thrown off by the fact that Shark was not reporting other threads, byt that may be an issue in Shark...

Well, ever since the GHz race is over the performance of machines has not increased (or even to the contrary) since it's hard to feed all cores for common R tasks in practice and per-thread speed has gone down (see the old Nehalem benchmarks thread - unfortunately it's still true).

Hi All

  As I just upgraded to a new macbook pro, I finally updated to R
2.11.0.   I was hoping for a quick suggestion on how to set it so that
I can utilize q() or quit() as I use to back in the good old days of
2.9.x !!

 Thanks!!!!

As the message says, if you really want to do that and kill all your documents, you can either use base::q() or base::quit() directly or (as NEWS say) set "RGUI.base.quit" option to TRUE if you want the old (dangerous) behavior.

Just as a reminder the only safe way to close the R GUI is <Cmd><Q> (followed by <Cmd><D> or <Enter> depending on whether you want to save the workspace or not) otherwise the GUI is killed instead of closed resulting in potential data loss.

Message-ID: <3137337F-08AC-422B-A80B-D27CDB42065B@cancercenter.columbia.edu>

Dear List,

	I want to install R.2.11 for Mac while keeping my previous versions  
(R.2.9 is the most recent.).
I am running Mac OS X 10.5.8.

On the installer the following note appears:

Note: By default the installer upgrades previous Leopard build of R   
if present. If you want to keep the previous Leopard build, use
pkgutil --forget org.r-project.R.Leopard.fw.pkg

Here is what happens when I try the command

[richard-friedmans-computer:/usr/sbin] friedman% ./pkgutil --forget  
org.r-project.R.Leopard.fw.pkg
No receipt for 'org.r-project.R.Leopard.fw.pkg' found at '/'.

  In the past I used to remove R-Framework.pkg from Library/Receipts  
but I am not sure that this will work
this time.

Thanks and best wishes,
Rich

I means that you did not install any previous version of the R framework for Leopard so there is nothing to forget.

If you want to make 100% sure that there are no other receipts, check your list of packages with something like

 pkgutil --pkgs | grep -i r-project

OS X 10.5 and higher no longer use Library/Receipts for native (flat) packages - but they might for legacy packages so if your package is way old, check there. However, the currently distributed R is Leopard build and a flat package, so it should be irrelevant given the message above.

Simon

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] make font size bigger/smaller in help view
Message-ID: <75A05839-3587-4F12-9FCC-1A1AD996ECC8@gmail.com>

Hi there,

To make the font size bigger/smaller in help view, you can connect "makeTextLarger" and "makeTextSmaller" actions of WebView of HelpView (MainMenu.nib) to menu->Format->Font->Bigger/Smaller, then you can use key "cmd +" and "cmd -" to change font size of help view. Hope this can be added to official release. And better to provide a preference option to control the help view font, since the default is really small on current mac machines.

To clarify, both Macbook Pro tests were carried out on OS X 11.6.3. Regarding memory speed, the new laptop uses 1067GHz DDR3, while the older one uses 667GHz DDR2. In short, the 2008 laptop has both slower and older CPU and slower memory, but I think it has slightly larger cache memory (4Mb versus 3Mb---but I think there is more to it).

I did a little linear regression (lm()) test for a 100000x100 dimension matrix. In this case, the Core i5 finished at ~3.2sec while the Core 2 Duo finished at ~5.7sec. So that was good news. But I have not been able to explain the BLAS performance, which I also carried out with 500 and 5000 dimensional matrices with the same results (i.e. Core 2 Duo ahead of Core i5).

I guess there is no simple explanation for this.

Thanks for looking in to this,
Gardar

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] make font size bigger/smaller in help view
Message-ID: <DFD9FBB5-BF6C-40E8-B771-B35FEAB184B8@gmail.com>

Hi there,

To make the font size bigger/smaller in help view, you can connect "makeTextLarger" and "makeTextSmaller" actions of WebView of HelpView (MainMenu.nib) to menu->Format->Font->Bigger/Smaller, then you can use key "cmd +" and "cmd -" to change font size of help view. Hope this can be added to official release. And better to provide a preference option to control the help view font, since the default is really small on current mac machines.

Can you try (from the Terminal) loading R like follows?

R --vanilla

Assuming that that works, it appears that you have a (big) .RData file
that is loaded during startup.

You may want to check its size by running (also from the Terminal)

du -h ~/.RData

To give you a chance of inspecting its contents before removal, you
can rename it (from the Terminal):

mv ~/.RData ~/PreviousResultsFromR.RData

After renaming it, you should be able to load R without problems.

My best guess of the BLAS is that vecLib is not optimised for i5 and i7. There is no point to optimise it for some "future products", so it can hardly been optimisation before the release of new MBP. And after the release, there are surely no updates yet. This is just my guess.

But I have not been able to explain the BLAS performance, which I also carried out with 500 and 5000 dimensional matrices with the same results (i.e. Core 2 Duo ahead of Core i5).

I do not think this is a Mac specific question, and I think you should  
read the r-help Posting Guide.

I suspect this is more for R-help than for R-mac, but I suspect that:

function.for.spaghetti.plot(data, col = your.color.vector)
your.color.vector = a vector of color, of length equal to that of the students, where students that you want to have the same color (say student 1and 3) are coded as the same color (say 'red', 'blue', 'red')

Google spaghetti plots and R, it might prove helpful. And check the help for legend()

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] building R package on Mac OS: R CMD build yields empty
	directories
Message-ID: <4BF3F385.9070905@ufz.de>

Dear R-sig-mac folks,

I recently moved from Windows to Mac and now tried to build my package 
(bipartite) under Mac. I followed the instructions I found online 
(http://www.personality-project.org/R/makingpackages.html
http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/RMacOSX-FAQ.html
http://www.math.yorku.ca/~hkj/Software/macpac.pdf).

My problem: although "R CMD build bipartite" works, it produces a nicely 
packed set of EMPTY directories:

cle09:~ dormann$ R CMD build bipartite
* checking for file 'bipartite/DESCRIPTION' ... OK
* preparing 'bipartite':
* checking DESCRIPTION meta-information ... OK
* cleaning src
* removing junk files
* checking for LF line-endings in source and make files
* checking for empty or unneeded directories
WARNING: directory 'bipartite/data' is empty
WARNING: directory 'bipartite/inst/doc' is empty
WARNING: directory 'bipartite/man' is empty
WARNING: directory 'bipartite/R' is empty
WARNING: directory 'bipartite/src' is empty
* building 'bipartite_1.12.tar.gz'

Could anyone provide me a hint what is going wrong here?
Is there any way I can make "R CMD" tell me what it is doing, so that I 
can see what goes wrong?

Many thanks,

Carsten


Details:
My package "bipartite" is positioned in the root (~dormann/bipartite).
(Since R CMD build finds it and makes a nice, if empty, package, this 
seems to be correct, too.)

Everything in this package builds perfectly under Windows.

Mac OS X 10.6.3
R 2.11.0
Xcode updated today
I installed all "tools": gfortran-4.2.3.dmgm gcc-42.5531-darwin8.tar.gz
Instead of MacTeX I have BasicTeX (which works alright with TeXShop, so 
I assume it also to work alright with R)

I have just downloaded the source of bipartite.
I ran R CMD build bipartite in the directory containing bipartite.
No error message. 
It generated a perfectly correct .tar.gz with no error messages.

By the way, R CMD build <...> does not produce directories; it produces a <...>.tar.gz

So it would seem that your bipartite directory is empty.
Try downloading the source package from CRAN and then run R CMD check.

Hi,

I'm getting the following error when trying to build and install an R package:

Error in untar2(tarfile, files, list, exdir) : unsupported entry type ?x?

I build the package like so:
R --no-init-file CMD build mypackage

Then try to install it:
sudo R --no-init-file CMD INSTALL mypackage.tar.gz

...which dies with the above error. I can extract the archive fine
with tar -zxf.

R version 2.11.0 (2010-04-22)
OSX 10.6.3

I suspect this may be an OS X / Snow Leopard specific issue. It seems
that the entry type 'x' referred to above comes from tar.R and is the
type flag for "Extended header referring to the next file in the
archive" according the the GNU Basic Tar Format docs. Is Snow Leopard
adding some apple specific juju to my files that's causing this?

This was originally posted on r-help. Please excuse the cross-post.

Any hints would be greatly appreciated! Thanks,


- chris

Yes, it is.  (Or more accurately, the 'tar' from libarchive is, and 
Apple changed the 'tar' they used for SL.)  And ?tar refers you to 
less partisan documentation.

Note that GNU is not a standard here: POSIX was, and these 
extensions are non-standard.  And neither GNU tar nor the libarchive 
tar follow the standard in other ways (nor do they even comply to 
their own documentation).

> This was originally posted on r-help. Please excuse the cross-post.

Please do follow the posting guide: you failed to so some basic 
homework.  E.g. NEWS says

     o	R CMD INSTALL now uses the internal untar() in package utils:
 	this ensures that all platforms can install bzip2- and
 	xz-compressed tarballs.	 In case this causes problems (as it
 	has on some Windows file systems when run from Cygwin tools)
 	it can be overridden by the environment variable
 	R_INSTALL_TAR: setting this to a modern external tar program
 	will speed up unpacking of large (tens of Mb or more)
 	tarballs.

and this is also documented under ?INSTALL.

Dear Berend,

thanks for your input. It got me onto the right track - sort of.
First, I repeated what you suggested: build an existing version. This 
caused a problem with LaTeX fonts (which then lead to a whole new line 
of trouble because my BasixTeX wrongly claims to be a 2010 release and 
hence TeX Live Manager wouldn't install the missing packages.)

Having fixed that, the old version built properly, but the new one still 
generated the tar.gz with empty directories.
Eventually I found that a (hidden) .Rbuildignore was still in the 
package folder.

As I said, I am new to Mac and learned a lot about UNIX-style rights 
management, hidden files, finder relaunches, ...

Eventually, all seems to work smoothly now.

Thanks again,

Carsten

The issue is caused by a history file. Now, I'm a bit surprised that deleting ~/.Rhistory did not resolve it -- possibly because you're using a custom history filename? Check the history file you use -- run this Terminal:

defaults read org.R-project.R 'History file path used for R type history files'

and move/delete the corresponding file. Actually, before you delete it, would you consider sending it to me so I can try to track the cause?

Dr. Ripley,

Thanks for your reply and for the pointer to the environment variable
to the R_INSTALL_TAR. That did the trick nicely.

Without resorting to the above solution, I was able to build my
package an another machine, also Snow Leopard. One difference between
the two machines is that user accounts and groups on my work machine
are managed by Active Directory, while my own machine has whatever
passes for 'normal' local accounts on OS X. So, I suspect that's the
source of the 'extended' non-standard tar block types.

Thanks,

-chris

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Problem with readline when building R from source.
Message-ID: <A78EB2F7-CD3B-4EE7-B113-B11AF3935A53@auckland.ac.nz>


I (just now) attempted to build an older version of R (2.10.1)
from source.  The ./configure step came to a halt with an error:

> configure: error: --with-readline=yes (default) and headers/libs are not available

In the past I had been able to build R from source with no problems.

A short time ago, after installing R 2.11.0 (and having some problems with x11()
plotting) I attempted to go back to 2.10.1 by building from source, and found
that I couldn't, due to the foregoing configure error.

I was then told I could resolve the x11() plotting problems by updating my OS.
I finally got around to doing that --- just now --- and indeed this fixed the
x11() plotting problems.

I then figured I'd check and if it had also fixed the ``headers/libs are not
available'' problem --- it hadn't.

So can anyone tell me (preferably in monosyllables, i.e. please make it easy
to understand) how I can fix the ``headers/libs are not available'' problem?
I.e. how do I make the ``headers/libs'' available?

I ***would*** like to be able to build R from source, just as a fallback.

Ta.

	cheers,

		Rolf Turner


P. S.  My OS is Mac OS X 10.6.3.  The screen output from configure,  just before
the error, was:

Install readline (library + headers) - it is explained in the FAQ.

monosyllabic instructions: run

curl -s http://r.research.att.com/libs/readline-5.2-12-darwin8-bin4.tar.gz | sudo tar fvxz - -C /

The error you get means that you have some broken readline (or compatible) in your system. The only way to find out exactly is to look at config.log since it is specific to your particular setup (stock OS X does not have that problem AFAIK).

Cheers,
Simon

Your instructions were certainly clear enough; even I was able to follow them. :-)

However the impact of following these instructions was nil.  The screen output following
my execution of your recipe was:

But when I then tried the ./configure trick I got the same error message as before.

Looking into config.log I found:

Can you suggest anything that I might do about this problem?

Rolf,

you have broken fink is /sw -- remove it (or move aside) and all should be well :)

	Psigh. I'm sure this is getting tedious for you ... but where else can I turn?

	I did:

		cd /sw
		sudo mv fink fink.broken

	Then I tried the ./configure trick again.  Same error message as before.

	Any other ideas? :-(

I believe Simon meant: remove or rename /sw and get rid of references to /sw/... in PATH

I believe you're right!  I renamed /sw and did the ./configure thing.  That got me past
the readline problem.  YAYYYYY!!!

But then a new problem reared it's ugly little head.  BOOOOOOO!!!

Any idea what the devil is going on here?  I'm getting very frustrated.  As usual. :-)

Lol! Ok, back to monosyllabic instructions - run:

sudo mv /sw /sw.orig


Fink is /sw, what you moved is just a random script inside fink.

I bet you are using 32-bit Fortran while using 64-bit gcc for everything else (see this list). You have two options: use F77="gfortran -arch x86_64" FC="gfortran -arch x86_64" or use the Leopard Fortran for Xcode instead of the old Tiger Fortran.

I bet you're right.  But how do I know?  I just do ./configure --- I don't say anything about what/which Fortran to use.

Rolf,

Given the weekend status, I'll hazard a guess that you want to add these as environment variables, so in an attempt to be monosyllabic:

Assuming that you are using the bash shell (which has been the default for a while) log in as the user you are going to run the ./configure script as, and at the command prompt type

export F77="gfortran -arch x86_64"
export FC="gfortran -arch x86_64"


to see what is currently set, just type 

export

(if you are still using the tcsh shell, the I think the command becomes setenv instead of export, and it is slightly different, so you will have to look that up)

good luck, I may have the wrong end of the stick here.

cheers

Ben

You are right.  Essentially you can change compilers and compiler
flags using a set of environment variables.  These variables are
common across projects where the build process is managed by automake.
 This is especially important if you want to switch between 32 and 64
bit.  My build R script goes more or less like
        ../${SRCDIR}/configure SHELL='/bin/bash' \
            CC="/usr/bin/gcc-4.2 -arch x86_64 -std=gnu99" \
            CFLAGS="-g -O2 -std=gnu99 -march=nocona" \
            CXX="/usr/bin/g++-4.2 -arch x86_64" \
            CXXFLAGS="-g -O2 -march=nocona" \
            OBJC="/usr/bin/gcc-4.2 -arch x86_64" \
            F77="/usr/bin/gfortran-4.2 -arch x86_64" \
            FFLAGS="-g -O2 -march=nocona" \
            FC="/usr/bin/gfortran-4.2 -arch x86_64" \
            FCFLAGS="-g -O2 -march=nocona" \
            --x-includes=/usr/X11/include --x-libraries=/usr/X11/lib \
            --with-system-zlib \
            --with-blas='-framework vecLib' --with-lapack
        make -j2 || exit 1
        make check || exit 1
Note that I have the sources in one directory, but build in another
which is now recommended for many projects.

In general, all of this is more important on OS X than on Linux
because on OS X we typically have 2 compilers and 4 different
architectures.  The -arch flag makes a 64bit version.  And then there
is the whole issue of universal binaries.

Rolf: most of this can be learned from reading:
http://r.research.att.com/building.html

Now, the second set of questions.  Gfortran does not come with Xcode.
Simon has over the last years released various gfortran versions for
use with the various OS X'es.  My guess is that you have a leftover
gfortran you used under your old OS X installation, that is not smart
to use with the current Xcode.  You should remove the old gfortran and
install the new one from
  http://r.research.att.com/tools/
There are quite a few ones there.  Assuming you want to use the newest
and assuming that you have installed Xcode 3.2.2, I would recommend
  http://r.research.att.com/gfortran-42-5659.pkg
In order to uninstall the old one: you just have to remove the files.
For many versions of gfortran, SImon provided something like
gfortran-uninstall, which you may have available.  Using all the
newest stuff may mean that you cannot use binary builds of R packages
from CRAN/Bioconductor (I am not really up to date on this), but if
you build R from source you usually want to build the packages from
source.

All of this is slightly complicated.  But if you wanted it easy, you
should use the CRAN binary build of R :)

Thanks for the input.  Seems to work.  I actually use tcsh, so I did the
equivalent tcsh thing:

setenv F77 "gfortran -arch x86_64"
setenv FC "gfortran -arch x86_64"

That solved the fortran problem, and the configure goes on well past the point where
it hung up last time.  But it eventually comes to a shuddering halt with an error
about X11 --- which is where I came in, really.  I'm toadally mystified.  The error
I'm getting is:

configure: error: --with-x=yes (default) and X11 headers/libs are not available

That is just like the error I was getting in respect of readline; I was told to update my
readline (via a fancy ``curl'' command).  I looked in //r.research.att.com/libs and could
not see any X11 package to which to apply a curly.

What the <expletive deleted> do I do now?

(And why do these things always happen to ***me***???)

But the documented way is to put these in a config.site file: and 
yes, it is in the R-admin manual.  So all that was needed was to put 
in file config.site (in the top-level R build directory)

CC='gcc -arch x86_64'
CXX='g++ -arch x86_64'
F77='gfortran -arch x86_64'
FC='gfortran -arch x86_64'
OBJC='gcc -arch x86_64'

(copied from the manual).

This one is probably that mentioned in the the R-admin manual for Snow 
Leopard, to wit

'Another quirk is that people have found that the X11 libraries are 
not in the default linking path, so something like 
@samp{LIBS=-L/usr/X11/lib} may be required.'

So add that line to the config.site file.

Perhaps because you don't study the manuals?  I've yet to see anything 
in this thread that is not covered in the general advice and the Mac 
OS X section of the R-admin manual.

We can't spell out the exact details for every possible system -- the 
possibilities are too many and the info would go out of date too 
rapidly.  But for a '0 new features' release, Snow Leopard sure did 
introduce a whole raft of barely documented changes and we've not yet 
caught up with some in configure (ideally X11 would be looked for in 
/usr/X11/lib, but what was Apple thinking of in dropping it?).

	Did so, and *that* unfortunately did not seem to work.  I'm still getting
	the

> configure: error: --with-x=yes (default) and X11 headers/libs are not available

	error, and configure bails out at that stage.

	Can you suggest something else that I might try, or suggest ways in which
	I could track down where the appropriate X11 material lives and how I can
	pass this information on to ``configure''?

	I don't know what the X11 ``headers/libs'' files are called, or what
	they look like.  Up to now I've just treated it all as a black box,
	and up to now that's worked.

	I did a ``locate X11'' just now and got over 14 ***thousand*** lines of
	output.  Bozhemoi!

>> What the <expletive deleted> do I do now?
>> 
>> (And why do these things always happen to ***me***???)

	I think the foregoing bears repeating.

	Seriously Brian, it's all very well to say ``read the manual'', and
	that works when one has a fairly solid understanding of what's
	***in*** the manual and one just needs to check on a detail of
	syntax, or like that.  But when one hasn't a clue as to what
	the underlying mechanisms are, that are triggering the problem,
	then reading the manual could entail a week's hard work with no
	guarantee at all of any positive results.

	It might be the case that the error is being triggered by some
	other quirk of the OS that actually has nothing to do with R.
	If one is sufficiently knowledgeable, one can discern this.  If
	one is not, it's all a big mystery.

	Actually I wouldn't even know *which* manual to start looking in.
	Now that I know it's the R-admin manual, it's obvious.  But things
	are [almost] always obvious once you know them.

	<SNIP>

	I don't understand the syntax of ``@samp{ ...'' at all, but
	looking at the manual, as Brian witheringly suggested ( :-) )
	led me to see the line suggested *without* the @samp{ } wrapper.

	So I just put the line

		LIBS=-L/usr/X11/lib

	into the config.site file, and begorrah, it worked!  So it
	would now appear that I can build R from source, as I wanted.
	At least until something else changes. :-)

	So you can all stop worrying about me, for a while. :-)

I guess I spoke too soon when I said that you could all stop
worrying about me! :-)

I thought that when I got past the configure step, I was home
and dry.  So I didn't actually do the make step right then.

When I tried ``make'' just now, I got an error:

mv /sw /sw.notused

and edit your Bash .profile to NOT source the init script of Fink (If I remember correctly).
Because that's how the Fink include and lib paths are activated and how Fink modifies your PATH. (I think).

Tried that.  And I get

make[3]: *** No rule to make target `/sw/include/iconv.h', needed by `sysutils.o'.  Stop.
make[2]: *** [R] Error 2
make[1]: *** [R] Error 1
make: *** [R] Error 1

So somehow it is still looking for /sw even though I moved /sw aside and took the call to
the init script out (of my .cshrc, actually).

Any other ideas?  Sorry for all the bother.

	cheers,

		Rolf Turner

P. S. Moreover, having moved /sw to /sw.local, I cannot get, e.g., aspell to work
even though I put /sw.local explicitly into my path.  Aaarrrggghhhh!!!

Are sure you cleaned up your build (i.e. removed the whole build directory) before configuring?

I'm not sure of *anything* since I don't understand the subtleties of the procedure @ all.

What I did was *remove* the directory created by untarring the R tarball.  I then
unpacked the tarball again, made the requisite edits to config.site, moved
/sw aside, took the line referring to /sw/bin/init.csh out of my .cshrc file,
did ./configure (that worked!) and then did ``make''.

Wound up getting:

What is the ``-lSM'' business all about?  What is ``SM''?  How do
I get the missing library?  Psigh!  :-(

You had the same thing some iterations ago.
-lSM  tells the linker to link against libSM.dylib (in this case; because of the -dynamiclib if i am correct).
This .dylib is in /usr/X11/lib

You may have forgotten to  put the line

		LIBS=-L/usr/X11/lib

into the config.site file.

I can't think of anything else.

Dang.  This is discouraging.  The line ``LIBS=-L/usr/Xll/lib'' is
definitely in config.site. :-(

You do realize that it's supposed to be X11 not Xll, right?

But now, seriously, why don't use just follow the instructions and do exactly the following (copy/paste):

rm -rf /tmp/build
mkdir /tmp/build
cd /tmp/build
curl -O http://cran.stat.auckland.ac.nz/src/base/R-2/R-2.11.0.tar.gz
tar fxz R-2.11.0.tar.gz
mkdir R-x86_64
cd R-x86_64
../R-2.11.0/configure r_arch=x86_64 CC="gcc -arch x86_64" \
CXX="g++ -arch x86_64" F77="gfortran -arch x86_64" \
FC="gfortran -arch x86_64" OBJC="gcc -arch x86_64" \
--x-includes=/usr/X11/include --x-libraries=/usr/X11/lib
make -j`sysctl -n hw.ncpu`



Your only technical issue was that fink was messing up your system, but now that it's gone, all you need to do is to use the regular instructions from FAQ/R-admin like all other people.

Cheers,
Simon

Well, that worked.  At last.  Thank you.

But I ***do*** follow instructions.  I had been following instructions,
and they weren't working.  These instructions are slightly/subtly different
from what I had previously been told to do.

As to the ``regular instructions from FAQ/R-admin'' --- that's all very well
if you know where to look and what the relevant issues are.  When you don't,
it makes searching for a needle in a haystack trivial by comparison.

Thanks again for getting my problem sorted.

	cheers,

All I'll say is that a simple search in the archives is the first thing anyone should do before posting here and if one did it would save a lot of time for everyone:

https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-mac/2009-September/006470.html

But don't plan to comment on this thread further.

Cheers,
Simon

Sorry for being very late to this thread, but since a few people mentioned Emacs, I'd like to chime in two things:

1. Emacs (with ESS) is a very nice solution that works exactly the same on Mac, Windows and Linux. It's also an excellent LaTeX editor (with the AUCTeX extension).

2. I now maintain an OS X version of my GNU Emacs distribution alongside the Windows version that has been available for a few years. It comes bundled with ESS, AUCTeX and some basic configuration. It is otherwise a stock GNU Emacs distribution, unlike Aquamacs that tries to be a Mac-ified Emacs. See

	http://vgoulet.act.ulaval.ca/emacs

I usually post about updates to ess-help.

Hope this helps,

Emacs a headache on the Mac??  No way.  The Mac, because 
a BSD Unix machine, is made for Emacs.  For some of us, Mac 
OSX and Emacs are our native territory.  Sure, R on the Mac 
can pose challenges that are different from those of Windows
on the Mac, but that is another story.
