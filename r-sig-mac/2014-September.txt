Hi all,

I tried to load a package which includes a shared object on one of my Macs,
and I got an error message below, which suggests that the file "
libquadmath.0.dylib" is missing in the /usr/local/lib folder. On my other
Mac however, I have no problem loading the package, and the file "
libquadmath.0.dylib" is in the /usr/local/lib folder. I wonder where this
libquadmath.0.dylib file is from, and how I can install it on the computer
where it is missing. Thanks!

library(WRScpp)
Error in dyn.load(file, DLLpath = DLLpath, ...) :

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Clipboard problems
Message-ID: <540701F1.9090703@stats.uwo.ca>

The standard advice for reading the clipboard on OSX is to use the
pipe("pbpaste") connection, but I'm finding it misses the last line.  (I
believe the last line in my examples generally doesn't include any EOL
marker.)  For example, if I highlight these three lines:

line 1
line 2
line 3

and copy to the clipboard, then readLines(pipe("pbpaste")) gives

[1] "line 1" "line 2"

in R.app or R in a terminal.  If I paste them here, I get

line 1
line 2
line 3

with the cursor left on the third line after the 3.  In a console, echo
`pbpaste` gives

line 1 line 2 line 3

so the problem isn't (only) with pbpaste.

How about using tcltk?

if (require("tcltk")) strsplit(tclvalue(tcl("clipboard","get")),"\n")[[1]]

I think that the issue is that the last line is incomplete and pipe() is non-blocking

E.g.,

Peters-iMac:R-docs pd$ pbpaste
line 1
line 2
line 3Peters-iMac:R-docs pd$ 

and (with the same clipboard)

> readLines(pipe("pbpaste"))
[1] "line 1" "line 2"

pushes back the incomplete line, hoping that it might be available for a later read. (It takes someone smarter than me to say whether this is unavoidable or whether pipe() should be able to detect that the
command has completed.)

This works, presumably because text connections are not non-blocking:

> readLines(textConnection(system("pbpaste",intern=TRUE)))
[1] "line 1" "line 2" "line 3"

or the following should also work on each OSX

readLines(pipe("pbpaste|awk 1?))

libquadmath is part of the Fortran compiler, it is not a standard library, so it will be only present if you install the compiler.

Note that the Mavericks build of R on CRAN also ships with the quadmath library and Mavericks CRAN package binaries use it from there. If you compile a package yourself and want others to be able to use it, you may want to change the path from /usr/local/lib/libquadmath.0.dylib to /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.1/Resources/lib/libquadmath.0.dylib via install_name_tool --- the same goes for libgfortran.3.dylib.

Cheers,
Simon

Dear Simon,

Thanks for the quick reply. I tried to do what you suggested:

install_name_tool -id
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.1/Resources/lib/libquadmath.0.dylib
/usr/local/lib/libquadmath.0.dylib

But I got the following error messages:

error:
/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/install_name_tool:
can't open input file: /usr/local/lib/libquadmath.0.dylib for writing

error:
/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/install_name_tool:
can't lseek to offset: 0 in file: /usr/local/lib/libquadmath.0.dylib for
writing (Bad file descriptor)
error:
/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/install_name_tool:
can't write new headers in file: /usr/local/lib/libquadmath.0.dylib (Bad

error:

can't close written on input file: /usr/local/lib/libquadmath.0.dylib (Bad
file descriptor)


The first error (Permission denied) can be solved by using "sudo" I
suppose. But I am not sure what caused the other three errors. Do you
happen know what may have been the root of the errors? Thank you again.

Best,
-Xiao

sudo should solve them all - the FD is invalid because it could not be opened in the first place.

Note that if you can't sudo, you can also use install_name_tool -change on the package .so to change the path there instead. But the above would be a more permanent solution.

Cheers,
Simon

I believe I have finally fixed this.  Thanks to Simon who gave the right
solution:  use the windowWillClose notification rather than the dealloc
message.  Thanks also to Neil Tiffin who told me something about how to
implement this, and to Michail Vidiassov who did some nice debugging.

For future reference, here's a summary:

The dealloc method of my object was not called immediately when the
window was closed, so there was a period when rgl thought it had a
window but didn't.  Switching the cleanup code to the windowWillClose
notification fixed this, as I already mentioned.

To add my GLView object as a delegate to receive that notification, I
needed to declare that it supported the NSWindowDelegate protocol when
it was declared, and needed to tell the window to use it as a delegate
via [osxWindow setDelegate:view].

Hello Folks,
   I?m on a Macbook Air running OSX 10.9.2 and I?m trying to install some libraries or packages (quant mod, TTA, etc.) to begin learning how to use the software. Unfortunately, I?ve encountered errors every step along the way. I?ve tried with R versions 3.0.3, 3.1.0, and 3.1.1 all with no luck.

First a couple of suggestions (people on the various R mailing lists tend
to be picky about things)

   - do not send HTML email, send only plain text

   - spell things right (there is no package named ?quant mod?, and
misspelling means you are asking potential helpers to do more work than
necessary)

   - show in the email (copy/paste) exactly what you tried, and exactly
what the error messages were (people need that information to help). Not
everyone is willing to go look at something that was posted somewhere.

That said, when I tried
   install.packages(?quantmod?)
at the R prompt, it worked for me, shown below.


> install.packages('quantmod')

A standard installation of R should succeed.

I?ve never heard of a package named TTA, and it isn?t on CRAN. When a
package isn?t on CRAN you should tell the list where it?s from. Maybe you
meant TTR.

I?m running OSX 10.9.4, R 3.1.1, and it?s the ?Mavericks? version of R
downloaded from CRAN. Don?t bother with older versions of R; virtually
certain to be a waste of time.

Possibly you need Xcode (from Apple), though not for quantmod itself, but
one can?t tell without seeing the error messages.

Can you install any packages at all, or is it just quantmod and a few
others you?re having trouble with?

Hello Folks,
   I?m on a Macbook Air running OSX 10.9.2 and I?m trying to install some
libraries or packages (quant mod, TTA, etc.) to begin learning how to use
the software. Unfortunately, I?ve encountered errors every step along the
way. I?ve tried with R versions 3.0.3,
 3.1.0, and 3.1.1 all with no luck. I?ve had difficulty with everything
from install.packages to install_github and just can?t seem to figure it
out. The steps I?m trying to follow can be seen in the screenshots at the

 this out, or remote connect to see my issues, and help me get this thing

Well there is bit of a problem with this: "... Macbook Air running OSX 10.9.2 ".

There is no good reason to be using a version of R that is that old. But if you can concoct a less-than-good reason to do so, then you need to a) have the necessary Xcode for installing from source (which might not be the same as the current versions of Xcode) and might depend on the unstated version of MacOSX), b) identify (using the dates of packages) the version of the source code for 'quantmod' and all of its dependencies, and then c) install those from source all the versions of the relevant packages.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Dependencies & Packages Fail To Install (quantstrat)
Message-ID: <36A29CFA-7034-4049-9385-1A7CE696199F@gmail.com>

Hello Again Folks,
   Let me say in advance I apologize for the length of the code I?ve posted, but I do not know what is essential and what is not. I?ve been advised I should reiterate my previous question. I?m on a Macbook Air running 10.9.4 and R version 3.1.1 Mavericks. I?m trying to follow a financial analysis tutorial, which can be found here: 

https://www.bigmiketrading.com/matlab-r-project-python/32719-webinar-introduction-r-trading-w-ilya-kipnis-3.html

It requires that I install packages, and tells me to run the following code in R:

install.packages("Defaults")
install.packages("devtools")
install.packages("zoo")
install.packages("quantstrat", repos="http://R-Forge.R-project.org", type="source")
install.packages("TTR", repos="http://R-Forge.R-project.org", type="source")
require(quantstrat)
require(devtools)
install_github(repo"IKTrading", username="IlyaKipnis")
install_github(repo"DSTrading", username="IlyaKipnis")
require(DSTrading)
require(IKTrading)

I?ve also tried downloading these packages to my desktop and using terminal, but I still received some errors about dependencies and such not being available. I?m not sure if there?s a technical issue here, or a me issue here. The first two packages install with no issues, but quantstrat and TTR have some difficulties. When the code gets to this section, I then get the following. Further, I?ve been instructed by others that this has worked for them just fine. Thank you in advance for any help.:

But if you can concoct a less-than-good reason to do so, then you need to a) have the necessary Xcode for installing from source (which might not be the same as the current versions of Xcode) and might depend on the unstated version of MacOSX), b) identify (using the dates of packages) the version of the source code for 'quantmod' and all of its dependencies, and then c) install those from source all the versions of the relevant packages.

My apologies for the cognitive error that misinterpreted this as R 2.9.2. 

I would ask if Jason has read this: http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-admin.html#OS-X and has all the approporiate Xcode and matching compilers installed before attempting to compile from source (as one would need to do if getting packages from r-forge)?

I?ve just upgraded to Mavericks V10.9.4, and I?m installing Xcode 4.2 and planned on installing fortran V4.2.4 that I found at this link: http://r.research.att.com/tools/

Lastly, I?m going to use Apple?s Xcode to install the command line tools, as instructed here: http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-admin.html#OS-X

Am I correct in thinking this is all I will need to install (excluding R and RStudio again) before this should work and successfully build and install packages?

Now I?m really lost. It seems Xcode 4.2 can?t be installed on my version of mac, but fortran is not available for anything above lion. I?ve seen fortran 4.8 mentioned in Google, but can?t seem to find any signs of a download.

See R-admin manual C.3: OS X

Probably most easily downloaded and installed by

curl -s http://r.research.att.com/libs/gfortran-4.8.2-darwin13.tar.bz2 | sudo tar fxj - -C /


The underlying issue here is that your instructions are really meant for advanced users, using packages that don't even provide binaries nor exist on CRAN.

Cheers,
Simon

I cannot thank everyone enough! For closure and future reference I listed below the steps I took.

Completely Uninstall R and Everything Associated With It
Install R V3.1.1 Mavericks 
Install gfortran V4.8 with the following command:
curl -s http://r.research.att.com/libs/gfortran-4.8.2-darwin13.tar.bz2 | sudo tar fxj - -C /
Open R, and run these code lines first:
install.packages("Defaults?)
Install.packages("devtools?)
install.packages("zoo?)
After Succesful Install Run These Codes Line By Line:
install.packages("quantstrat", repos="http://R-Forge.R-project.org", type="source?)
install.packages("TTR", repos="http://R-Forge.R-project.org", type="source?)
Last But Not Least, I Ran These
install_github(repo"IKTrading", username = "IlyaKipnis?)
install_github(repo"DSTrading", username = "IlyaKipnis?)
Installed RStudio
All that said and done, everything installed and is now working properly. I?m not sure if it was the Macbook Update/gfortran 4.8/Using R to install everything first, but it?s working. This is what I?m going to recommend to other mac users on the tutorial forum that were having issues. Thanks again to the 10/15 of you who e-mailed me and contributed!

Regards,
    Jason E.

But if you can concoct a less-than-good reason to do so, then you need to a) have the necessary Xcode for installing from source (which might not be the same as the current versions of Xcode) and might depend on the unstated version of MacOSX), b) identify (using the dates of packages) the version of the source code for 'quantmod' and all of its dependencies, and then c) install those from source all the versions of the relevant packages.

This is a serious error. This application, or a library it uses, is
using an invalid context  and is thereby contributing to an overall
degradation of system stability and reliability. This notice is a
courtesy: please fix this problem. It will become a fatal error in an

I get this message occasionally, but not systematically enough to
give a recipe for generating it.

I believe it is an OS message related to graphing on the Quartz device.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Failure of CLI with .Rprofile on Mac OS X
Message-ID: <D552A157-6BF9-49AD-81F9-10CCB5ADAFC1@mail.nih.gov>

When R starts in GUI on my Mac OS X 10.7.5, the startup configuration in .Rprofile works fine. However, when R starts through command line interface (CLI) on the terminal , it does not work at all. 

The GUI R on my Mac is aliased on the terminal to /Applications/R.app/Contents/MacOS/R while the CLI R (/usr/bin/R) is linked to /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/bin/R. There is only one .Rprofile, which resides in my home directory ~/.

R version 3.1.0 (2014-04-10)
Platform: x86_64-apple-darwin10.8.0 (64-bit)

What could be the cause for the failure with CLI?

Thanks,
Gang

You left out the part where you show us what's in your .Rprofile. If there is anything in there specific to R.app (an application different from R), of course it won't work with CLI ("base") R.

For testing purpose, there is only one statement in my .Rprofile

.First <- function() source('~/test.R')

and test.R contains a few functions with which I could test whether .Rprofile has been loaded or not.

Caveat: I'm not the best person to answer this. I'm not a skilled user of Unix and I'm not one of the Mac development team. But those guys are often not reading the mailing list on weekends so I thought I'd throw some ideas out that you could investigate.


#----- Idea # 1 ---------
Running 3.1.1 this is what I see among the environment variables that are different in a CLI session of R from those in a GUI session. In particular I am wondering if your PWD variable points to your User/username/ directory:

> Sys.getenv()[grep('Users', Sys.getenv())]
                                HOME                                  PWD 
             "/Users/davidwinsemius"              "/Users/davidwinsemius" 
                      XDG_CACHE_HOME                      XDG_CONFIG_HOME 
      "/Users/davidwinsemius/.cache"      "/Users/davidwinsemius/.config" 
                       XDG_DATA_HOME 
"/Users/davidwinsemius/.local/share" 

I haven't been able to find exactly what PWD is pointing to. It's not listed in the "environment variables" link from ?Sys.getenv. I think it's related tot eh Unix cli command `pwd` which prints the working directory. I don't know how to give you a direct link to the page with a listing of environment variables, since that page is one the doesn't conform to the convention of having a ?NameOfPage lookup. Its page name is "EnvVar" but ?EnvVar gives a "No documentation for ?EnvVar? ..." message. I also do not find "PWD" in a search of the Install/Admin document.

I tried changing PWD in a session an quitting, but it didn't seem to "stick".

[10] sandwich_2.3-0      zoo_1.7-11      

#---------- Idea # 2 --------

Another possibility is implied by this portion of the ?Startup page that (I already suggested you read):

"If you want ?~/.Renviron? or ?~/.Rprofile? to be ignored by child R processes (such as those run by R CMD check and R CMD build), set the appropriate environment variable R_ENVIRON_USER or R_PROFILE_USER to (if possible, which it is not on Windows) "" or to the name of a non-existent file."


#------ Suggestion -------------
So you need to check whether any of those are different than what you expect. Failing illumination after poking around in your setup,  I suspect you may need to post the output of ALL of sessionInfo() AND the results of dput(Sys.getenv()) .

Notice that we have a similar, but unresolved, bug report a month old.

https://bugs.r-project.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=15940

I assume that the obvious things like a .Rprofile in the current directory has been checked? 

Running R under a debugger, single-stepping through the startup code would likely isolate the trouble, but it's a bit of work to set up, and of course it needs to be on the machine that actually displays the problem.

Peter;

Do you know whether the "PWD" value in the result from  Sys.getenv() is supposed to point at the working directory of R started from the command line?

Yes, that's standard Unix shell behavior:

Peter-Dalgaards-MacBook-Air:~ pd$ cd r-devel/BUILD 
Peter-Dalgaards-MacBook-Air:BUILD pd$ echo $PWD
/Users/pd/r-devel/BUILD

I.e. it is done by the shell, R just inherits it. Notice that it is just a variable tracking the result of 'cd'. You can set it, but that doesn't actually do anything, except for things that use the PWD variable directly, like the shell prompt

Peter-Dalgaards-MacBook-Air:BUILD pd$ export PWD=/foo/bar
Peter-Dalgaards-MacBook-Air:bar pd$ pwd
/Users/pd/r-devel/BUILD

There are too many variables here to say for certain.  The 'command 
line' is a shell, but the user can choose what that is.  (For 
Terminal.app, it is in the Startup preferences.)  The command 'cd' 
normally sets the environment variable PWD, but there are variants for 
different shells, and /usr/bin/cd which calls the builtin 'cd' in the 
current shell.  (The POSIX command 'pwd' can also set PWD, and that too 
can be a shell builtin.)

The user can also set PWD, both in the shell and from inside R.

I suspected that I needed to put "more or less standard" in my reply...

Anyways, I think PWD is a red herring. Unless I'm confused (which has happened), the CLI on OS X is governed by src/unix/sys-unix.c and that has

attribute_hidden
FILE *R_OpenInitFile(void)
{
    char buf[PATH_MAX], *home, *p = getenv("R_PROFILE_USER");
    FILE *fp;

    fp = NULL;
    if (LoadInitFile) {
        if(p) {
            if(!*p) return NULL;  /* set to "" */
            return R_fopen(R_ExpandFileName(p), "r");
        }
        if((fp = R_fopen(".Rprofile", "r")))
            return fp;
        if((home = getenv("HOME")) == NULL)
            return NULL;
        snprintf(buf, PATH_MAX, "%s/.Rprofile", home);
        if((fp = R_fopen(buf, "r")))
            return fp;
    }
    return fp;
}

and $PWD doesn't factor into this. $HOME does, though. I can see three ways in which $HOME/.Rprofile might drop off the radar:

1) HOME set incorrectly
2) $HOME or $HOME/.Rprofile not readable according to permissions and ownership of R binary
3) path length overflow 

Neither seem particularly likely to me, but they should be relatively easy to check. (PATH_MAX on OS X seems to be 1024).

Something in the style of (NB, this zaps an existing ~/.Rprofile if you copy it literally)

$ echo 'Rprofile <- TRUE' >  ~/.Rprofile
$ R
...
> Rprofile
[1] TRUE
> file.show(paste(Sys.getenv("HOME"),".Rprofile", sep="/"))

Thanks all for chiming in!

Just tried the following:

> 2) $HOME or $HOME/.Rprofile not readable according to permissions and ownership of R binary

ls -l $HOME/.Rprofile
-rw-r--r--  1 gangc  admin  17 Sep 21 07:10 /Users/gangc/.Rprofile

> 3) path length overflow

Less than 1024 characters.

In CLI R:

> file.show(paste(Sys.getenv("HOME"),".Rprofile", sep="/"))
Rprofile <- TRUE

> Rprofile
Error: object 'Rprofile' not found

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] "special" paper option of postscript device not working
Message-ID: <CAGXC+CBRucGxkfWWo4oRF=WG6gT5ED-FEtaeoODJ1hZf7UCdYg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

The journal where I want to submit does not accept PDF figures, only
postscript (or bitmaps, which I want to avoid).

I want to control paper size by combining paper = "special" and "width" and
"height" parameters to the postscript command, but the resulting page is
always 8 x 11, at least as viewed with Preview and Illustrator.

This is with this code:
    postscript(file="test.ps", width=5.5, height=4.25, horizontal=T, paper
= "special")
    par(mar=c(2.8, 2.8, 1.8, 0.2)+0.1, xpd=F, mgp=c(1.5,0.5,0), cex.lab=1)

    plot(1:10)
    dev.off()

The plot occupies 1/4 of the 11x8.5 inch page.

I can live with this, but my reading of the postscript device documentation
is that width and height control the size of the paper if I also use the
page = "special" option. Because this could be the result of working on a
Mac, I write here first, but will ask on the general R Help list if this
has nothing to do with the Mac.

Thanks in advance,

Denis

Denis,

In general and as noted in the Details section of ?postscript, you will want to create an EPS file, using the following incantation:

  postscript(file = ..., width = ..., height = ..., horizontal = FALSE, 
             paper = "special", onefile = FALSE)

Thus:

postscript(file = "test.eps", width = 5.5, height = 4.25, 
           horizontal = FALSE, paper = "special", onefile = FALSE)
par(mar=c(2.8, 2.8, 1.8, 0.2)+0.1, xpd=F, mgp=c(1.5,0.5,0), cex.lab=1)
plot(1:10)
dev.off()


On my Mac, with OS X 10.9.5, the attached file is generated in the fashion that you would expect.

There is also the ?setEPS function.

Regards,

Marc Schwartz

Good day,

I am trying to run R2jags on  R version 3.0.2 (2013-09-25) -- "Frisbee Sailing". I have downloaded jags (JAGS-Mavericks-3.4.0) and successfully installed both rjags and R2jags yet for some reason when I try and load the library(rjags) I receive the following error message:

Error : .onLoad failed in loadNamespace() for 'rjags', details:
 call: dyn.load(file, DLLpath = DLLpath, ...)
 error: unable to load shared object '/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.0/Resources/library/rjags/libs/rjags.so':

Does anyone have any idea why this might be? I have also tried other versions of R and it doesn't seem to be working for them either.

Thanks!
Joanna

That's the problem - your'e using old R version with recent JAGS - that doesn't work. You should use most recent R (3.1.1 at this point) with the most recent JAGS. The other alternative is to use old R with old JAGS versions - not the best idea, though.

Cheers,

It's also important to match the version of OSX to the JAGS version. If you are one of the laggards in adopting Mavericks, as am I, then it's not immediately obvious where to find the SnowLeopard version.

The default Mavericks version that pops up with this SourceForge link does not work with my Lion machine:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/?source=typ_redirect

You need to go to this page instead:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/files/JAGS/3.x/Mac%20OS%20X/

I picked this link:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/files/JAGS/3.x/Mac%20OS%20X/JAGS-SnowLeopard-3.4.0.dmg/download

Once that was installed I was able to build the rjags and R2jags from CRAN sources using the GUI package installer.

Thanks Marc,

You are correct, it works if I add onefile=FALSE. 

But how would you control page size for a multiple-page document (say 5 figures, one per page), for which you would normally use onefile=TRUE?

Denis,

If you are submitting figures to a journal, you don't want a multipage file, you want one plot per file and EPS is a single page format.

They will usually then embed that EPS figure/file in whatever process they use to create the full paper. If they are using LaTeX, there are \includegraphics directives in the source .tex file that will tell the LaTeX processor to insert the EPS file (or other file types) into the resultant document at that point.

If you want a multipage PS file, you can create that, just like a multipage PDF file, but it would not be suitable for the submission of figures.

For example:

postscript("Multipage.ps", height = 5, width = 5)
barplot(1:5)
plot(1:10)
dev.off()

However, each page will be the same size (eg. US letter or A4, as defined by options()$papersize) and the plot size within the page will be defined by the height and width arguments.

Agreed, Marc,

But I more often use the pdf or quartz engines, and I find it useful to produce multiple page figures to screen results from experiments (several plots per page, each of a different type, one page per replication of the experiment.

I was just checking if I could just replace my pdf command by postscript and get the same thing. I agree with you that this would not be particularly useful (compared with pdf).

Denis,

If you are submitting figures to a journal, you don't want a multipage
file, you want one plot per file and EPS is a single page format.

They will usually then embed that EPS figure/file in whatever process they
use to create the full paper. If they are using LaTeX, there are
\includegraphics directives in the source .tex file that will tell the
LaTeX processor to insert the EPS file (or other file types) into the
resultant document at that point.

If you want a multipage PS file, you can create that, just like a multipage
PDF file, but it would not be suitable for the submission of figures.

For example:

postscript("Multipage.ps", height = 5, width = 5)
barplot(1:5)
plot(1:10)
dev.off()

However, each page will be the same size (eg. US letter or A4, as defined
by options()$papersize) and the plot size within the page will be defined
by the height and width arguments.

Regards,

Marc

You are correct, it works if I add onefile=FALSE.

But how would you control page size for a multiple-page document (say 5

Hi,

The journal where I want to submit does not accept PDF figures, only
postscript (or bitmaps, which I want to avoid).

I want to control paper size by combining paper = "special" and "width" and
"height" parameters to the postscript command, but the resulting page is
always 8 x 11, at least as viewed with Preview and Illustrator.

This is with this code:
postscript(file="test.ps", width=5.5, height=4.25, horizontal=T, paper
= "special")
par(mar=c(2.8, 2.8, 1.8, 0.2)+0.1, xpd=F, mgp=c(1.5,0.5,0), cex.lab=1)

plot(1:10)
dev.off()

The plot occupies 1/4 of the 11x8.5 inch page.

I can live with this, but my reading of the postscript device documentation
is that width and height control the size of the paper if I also use the
page = "special" option. Because this could be the result of working on a
Mac, I write here first, but will ask on the general R Help list if this
has nothing to do with the Mac.

Thanks in advance,

Denis



Denis,

In general and as noted in the Details section of ?postscript, you will
want to create an EPS file, using the following incantation:

postscript(file = ..., width = ..., height = ..., horizontal = FALSE,
          paper = "special", onefile = FALSE)

Thus:

postscript(file = "test.eps", width = 5.5, height = 4.25,
        horizontal = FALSE, paper = "special", onefile = FALSE)
par(mar=c(2.8, 2.8, 1.8, 0.2)+0.1, xpd=F, mgp=c(1.5,0.5,0), cex.lab=1)
plot(1:10)
dev.off()


On my Mac, with OS X 10.9.5, the attached file is generated in the fashion
that you would expect.

There is also the ?setEPS function.

Regards,

Marc Schwartz

Message-ID: <CABtg=K=ZMZ-0okCHqnkDhTxOkWwLtjXegRXPFvby4FR08Kr4=A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have a little mystery here, and ideas would be welcome.

I would like to unload the package igraph. The following works fine
with the package downloaded from CRAN (Snow Leopard package):

install.packages("igraph")
library(igraph)
library(devtools)
unload(inst("igraph"))

However, if I build the package myself on my machine, then it does not
work any more and unloading hangs. I can press CTRL+C to get the R
prompt back, but every command hangs again. This is my machine:

~$ xcodebuild -version
Xcode 5.1.1
Build version 5B1008

~$ Rscript -e 'sessionInfo()'
R version 3.1.1 (2014-07-10)
Platform: x86_64-apple-darwin10.8.0 (64-bit)

locale:
[1] en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/C/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8

attached base packages:
[1] stats     graphics  grDevices utils     datasets  base

It also hangs if I call dyn.unload() directly, instead of calling
devtools; if I remove
the igraph.so file from the package, then it works again, so it is
definitely something with the .so file.

I know this is not much work with, but if you have any guesses, please
let me know. Thanks,
Gabor

Gabor,

what OS X version are you using? More recent OS X versions have slightly different C++ ABI so you can't really mix C++ code compiled on SL and let's say Mavericks - hence the two different sets of binaries. That would be my guess here since igraph uses C++ and it involves destructor code on unloading...

Cheers,
Simon

Hi Simon,

thanks for the answer, sorry, I should have included this, it is
apparently not in sessionInfo().

So, this happens on 10.9.4 with R 3.1.1 and also on 10.8.5 with R
3.1.0. And the (10.8) CRAN binary version of igraph unloads cleanly on
both of them.

I am not sure how and why destructors would be called when unloading,
igraph does not use any external pointers to keep C++ objects alive.
They should be destroyed when returning the C/C++ call to R. It is
certainly possible that they are not, because of a bug or something,
but I cannot even unload if I do not call any igraph functions at all,
just load the package. (Loading the package calls an igraph_init, but
that only sets some global variables, it does not create any C or C++
objects.)

But I definitely think that you are right in general, and this is some
binary incompatibility between the R binary and my binary. It has been
a long standing issue, actually. It never worked for me in the last ~5
years.

I am also not really sure how to debug this, but will check with an R
version compiled on my mac in a minute.

Thank again, Best,
Gabor

I also tried using the Mavericks build of R, and that works fine, too,
on my Mavericks laptop. \o/

I have no idea why the Snow Leopard R build did not work with my other
Snow Leopard machine, but honestly, I don't care much about it. :)

Thanks for the help, this is already a great day, and it is only 5:50am! :)

Best,
Gabor

More recent OS X versions have slightly different C++ ABI so you can't really mix C++ code compiled on SL and let's say Mavericks - hence the two different sets of binaries. That would be my guess here since igraph uses C++ and it involves destructor code on unloading...

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] issues running jags
Message-ID: <B7C7163E-2C34-4126-AC86-2ECE9A546F83@gmail.com>

Good day,

I am trying to run R2jags on  R version 3.0.2 (2013-09-25) -- "Frisbee Sailing". I have downloaded jags (JAGS-Mavericks-3.4.0) and successfully installed both rjags and R2jags yet for some reason when I try and load the library(rjags) I receive the following error message:

Error : .onLoad failed in loadNamespace() for 'rjags', details:
  call: dyn.load(file, DLLpath = DLLpath, ...)
  error: unable to load shared object '/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.0/Resources/library/rjags/libs/rjags.so':
  dlopen(/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.0/Resources/library/rjags/libs/rjags.so, 10): Symbol not found: __ZN5RangeC1ERKSt6vectorIiSaIiEES4_
  Referenced from: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.0/Resources/library/rjags/libs/rjags.so
  Expected in: /usr/local/lib/libjags.3.dylib
 in /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.0/Resources/library/rjags/libs/rjags.so
Error: package or namespace load failed for ?rjags?


Does anyone have any idea why this might be? I have also tried other versions of R and it doesn't seem to be working for them either.

Thanks!
Joanna

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Maverick 10.9.5
Message-ID: <CADk3Ai9kXZGKHOFx1GP=4BG0yA8a+0JZsoy7S-LHXcb9xYMsAg@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings
I hope you find well when you read this. I recently update my OS to
Maverick 10.9.5, (
http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1760?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US). My Mac
is a MacBook White with 8GB of Memory, 2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo. However,
in R version 3.1.1 (2014-07-10) Platform: x86_64-apple-darwin13.1.0
(64-bit) I have the next problem, when the script calls to splines library
(the most recent version) and later goes to make a count, the process stops
and the error appears.

 *** caught segfault ***
address 0x0, cause 'memory not mapped'

Traceback:
 1: .Call("countcorrelations", todata, c(0.5, 0.7, 0.9))
 2: t(.Call("countcorrelations", todata, c(0.5, 0.7, 0.9)))

Possible actions:
1: abort (with core dump, if enabled)
2: normal R exit
3: exit R without saving workspace
4: exit R saving workspace
Selection:
Selection:

I tried to remember this err, and if my memory don?t betray me the last
time that these err appeared was when I updated the IOS from Lion to
Maverick, and I had to re-recopilate the R-GUI and reinstall the R software
to Maverick version, but now I dont have any posible answer.
