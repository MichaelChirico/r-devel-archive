All that is needed is to do a right click (or its equivalent),
where for "approved" software a left click works the needed
magic.  The user is then asked whether, notwithstanding 
the lack of an Apple imprimatur, they wish to proceed.

A note to this effect might accompany any software that is
to be downloaded.  Most Mountain Lion users will rather
quickly latch onto this.

I'm an occasional Mac user and I didn't know that right-click -> Open works.
My response was to find the security option and permanently select "allow
applications downloaded from anywhere." The user who contacted me didn't get
that far. Mountain Lion has been out for a while and only one person has
complained, so you're probably right, though I'm not sure why it's better
for people to have to discover the right-click trick than to tell them. 

I don't think that it will hurt to add a remark to the Rcmdr Mac
installation instructions, so I'll do that.

Best,
 John

I have been away for awhile, sorry for this belated impasse. 

I still think that in the binary that can be obtained from CRAN it would be safer to replace 'gcc' with 'llvm-gcc' and 'g++' with 'llvm-g++' to ensure that the right compiler is used and thus the -arch argument is recognized. 

Thank you Kasper for taking the time to clarify the matter to me. I especially appreciate it now that I understand that this forum otherwise seems to be dominated by a 'if-you-don't-like-it-sod-of' attitude. I've found a reasonable workaround and I would have liked to contribute it so that R would be an even better experience on MacOS. 

My best regards,
/Peder Axensten

Message-ID: <CABCh89qEXLsFjhEq2JS=CXFOZdxxzwDq8f-0cJ0FKPD=yzNTuQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear r-sig-mac users:

I tried to brew R -- an initially failed.

I tried both

$ brew install R

and

$ brew install R --use-llvm

however both threw the following errors:

31747 Trace/BPT trap: 5       | R_DEFAULT_PACKAGES=NULL ../../../bin/R
--vanilla --slave > /dev/null
make[3]: *** [all] Error 133
make[2]: *** [R] Error 1
make[1]: *** [R] Error 1
make: *** [R] Error 1

Error: r did not build

      https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/issues/14910
      https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/issues/15063

The second link suggests the following work-around, which worked for me:

$ brew install R --env=std

Thought that this might be of interest to some on this list.

best regards

Dear Marco,

To provide some background, you and I have corresponded about your problem,
and now at least you appear to have the tcltk package installed. Did you
reinstall R as I suggested?

Have you checked that tcltk is working, following the instructions I sent
you in an earlier email?

I don't believe that the Rcmdr ever calls tk_messageBox directly, but there
is a tk_messageBox() function in tcltk, and you can check whether this is
the source (or a symptom) of the problem by issuing the following commands
in a fresh R session:

	library(tcltk)
	tk_messageBox(message="test")

That should, as the function name suggests, bring up a Tk message box.

Also I'm not sure what's going on with 'couldn't connect to display ":0"',
which suggests an X-Windows issue.

Finally, I'm moving this discussion to r-sig-mac, where you're more likely
to get knowledgeable assistance.

Best,
 John

Dear Simon,

Marco says that he installed "XQuark" (see his original message), which I
translate as " XQuartz."

Marco, can you run XQuartz.app (in Utilities on my Mac), which should open
an Xterm window?

Best,
 John

Message-ID: <51839234-EFC4-4A1C-8B8C-0C91B3D57E79@uni-bonn.de>

Hi guys,

I want to make a last comment on compiling R on a Mac OS with the GNU 4.7.1 compiler. I solved all my problems and I would like to present my way here for other users who may find it helpful.

I am using Mountain Lion 10.8.2 and followed: http://solarianprogrammer.com/2012/02/20/living-on-the-edge-building-gcc-4-7-on-mac-osx-lion/  for the installation of gcc-4.7.1. Furthermore I downloaded the latest version of XQuartz (http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/).

Next step: I downloaded the latest R-patched version 2.15.1 here (thanks for the tip Simon!): http://r.research.att.com. 

Then the following commands have been made: 

In the untared R-patched folder:

mkdir build && cd build

../configure CC=gcc-4.7 CXX=g++-4.7 F77=gfortran-4.7 FC=gfortran-4.7 OBJC=clang CFLAGS="-DOS_OBJECT_USE_OBJC=0" CPPFLAGS="-D__ACCELERATE__" --with-lapack --with-blas='-framework Accelerate' --with-x

sudo make 

sudo make install

Now R runs much faster on my Mac then before and without any problem. The only unsolved task yet is, that the R.framework - especially the library folder below Resources/ is not accessible by default. So installing a package results in an exception. I solved this task by simply changing the permissions on the folder. 

The solution to my problem has been brought up by a friend of mine in the HPC team at the Computing Center RWTH Aachen University (Germany), Hriesto Iliev (http://www.rz.rwth-aachen.de/aw/cms/rz/Themen/hochleistungsrechnen/hilfen_kurse_und_veranstaltungen/~svf/und_das_sind_wir/?lang=de or on stackoverflow: http://stackoverflow.com/users/1374437/hristo-iliev). 

In his words: The reason why compilation of aqua.c fails is due to a change possibly introduced in the 10.8 SDK. Several system header files now use by default some Obj-C constructs with extensions (code blocks), only supported by clang and Apple's version of GCC. The workaround is given via the C flag -DOS_OBJECT_USE_OBJC=0". 
The veLib problem can be used in two different ways: 

1. Simon Urbanek suggests to use the CPP flag -D__ACCELERATE__

2. Hriesto solved the problem via changing #include<vecLib/vecLib.h> to #include<Accelerate/Accelerate.h> in ../src/modules/lapack/vecLib95c.c (relative to the build directory).  

As vecLib is deprecated it should also be used --with-blas="-framework Accelerate" instead of --with-blas="-framework vecLib" (but both options seem to work).

Unfortunately there is another part that prevents one from building R with gcc-4.7: The Quartz graphics device must be compiled with the Objective-C compiler from Apple as (again) code blocks are used extensively in the OS X SDK and this time there is no workaround. Clang is a good candidate and as high performance libraries like OpenMP are not used in the graphics device, Xcode's default can be used without matters. So one simply changes the Obj-C compiler to clang: OBJC=clang. 
Following Hristo it is also unnecessary to specify "-arch x86_64" as the compiler is already producing 64-bit code by default. 

We are still not sure if we need the X11 graph device, as the Quartz one should be more capable (graphics in R work fine). Any comments are welcome. 

As I use R either on the command line or in RStudio I have not installed the R.app. If one wants to install it, one have to build R as a dynamic library to be later used by R.app. Doing so one needs the --enable-R-framework directive in the configure step above following the manual, but we got it by default...

With the building steps above one can now use R - or rather R extensions - with OpenMP 3.0 as well as other very helpful developments in the C++11 standard. I do not know other mathematical or hpc libraries, but as the compiler is the latest version everything should run.  

At the end I want to thank everyone here for his helpful comments and Hristo for his time - even if he is not connected to R (yet:))

Best

Simon

I don't have the time to compile gcc from scratch right now and none of the usual suspects supports ObjC - that alone is a sign that no one really uses gcc on OS X (other than for ports) since Apple has abandoned it. My guess would be that the ObjC support is not as complete as in Apple's version - it's probably more geared toward GNUstep - but that's just a guess.

Hi Jean,

We'll need some more information about what you did and how you went
about doing it.

Firstly, did you use the CRAN R installer or did you do something
"unofficial" like homebrew?

Second, can you launch R from the Terminal? [1] If so, it's likely a
GUI problem and not a problem with R itself.

Thirdly, don't panic. If you saved your scripts in a reasonable place
(e.g., anything under your home directory) the R installer shouldn't
have touched it.

Cheers,
Michael


[1] If you don't know how to do this, click the "Applications" stack
in your dock. Then utilities. Then Terminal. A window (likely white
with black font) will appear; type "R" (no quotes) into it and hit
enter.

Thanks for your reply! Me? Panic?! Never, I have only been working on  
this project for 2.5 years! :)

I was originally in R (the older version) and then I clicked on update  
an option from the Top Tool bar, it brought me to an R page and I  
clicked on update latest version for Mac OS X. I don't think I went to  
the CRAN R installer website and did not know to do so but do not  
remember visiting 'homebrew'.

I just tried launching from the Terminal and it did not work, the same  
default appeared and asked me if I wanted to relaunch again.

Please advise, Jean

Please try installing a current version of R from CRAN: that is several 
versions old and 2.15.1 is current (and 2.15.2 imminent).

Do you know what version you updated from?

Had I been Michael I would have asked you to start R with 'R --vanilla': 
one possibility is that the startup files have got corrupted or need 
updating for the updated R.

That's one file you may need to get out of the way.

That certainly seems to be a proper load so you can just use that to finish things up, but I'd strongly recommend you go to r-project.org and install the newest version of R directly from the official binaries. That hopefully will fix things up. 

Also, look into a good backup solution like Dropbox.

Hi Thanks for your attention.

I avoided updating because I heard of similar problems. But found I  
had to execute certain things. I can't find the R download in the  
folder I initially tried but I remember it telling me that it could  
not finish because the program was in use. I found this R icon next to  
my applications folder and it is Rstudio 0.96.331 but says modified 27  
Aug 12 - not sure if this is the version I tried today.

I do not know how to 'R --vanilla'

I would like to be able to run RStudio this is what I know of and was  
running from before.

I downloaded the latest version of R from the CRAN website (R-2.15.1  
signed.pkg) and restarted.

But the RStudio icon I had in my dock will still not launch. Now in my  
applications folder I have RStudio (big blue ball) and two icons for  
'R' - one with just 'R' the other with 'R64'. Should I be putting some  
of these in the trash?

What should I do now?

Jean

By the way, this second try to download the latest version of R from  
the CRAN site is the first time I was put through the installer walk  
through procedure - next, next, accepting terms of agreement etc.  The  
first time this did not happen but still managed to funk my system.

This might be a dumb question, but are you just referring to the line that says 'Type q() to quit'? 

That's absolutely nothing to worry about: just telling you how to quit when you're ready. 

It's the default startup message so I'm not sure how you could have not seen it in 2.5 years however...

Let me try to make this clearer: there are three pieces of software
working together:

i) R the cross platform interpreted language. When we say "start R"
this is really what we mean
ii) The R Mac GUI provided by Simon et al. which comes bundled with R
in the official installer, but is not required for use.
iii) RStudio which is a different GUI/IDE provided by other people
entirely which has its own support system distinct from these help
lists.

Both ii and iii start an instance of i but don't give you direct
access to it, instead filtering your commands and R's output through a
nicer user interface. Working through terminal gives you direct
exposure to i. (I'm simplifying greatly, but just go with it) If i
doesn't work, ii and iii can't, so that's the first thing to check.

If you can go back to terminal and type

R --vanilla

where you just typed

R

before, you are doing as Prof Ripley asks (and as I should have
noted). Once you do that, try a few basic R commands:

3 + 1:5

rnorm(10)

plot(5:1)

and make sure they work. Don't worry about the message starting with

"R Version 2.13.1" and ending with "Type q() to quit R." Anything
which appears before or after those lines, please report. From what
you've said, it sounds like R (in the sense i above) is still working
fine.

Then lets see if the GUI is working. In your applications folder by
way of the dock, try starting Simon's GUI by clicking on the
blue/purple R with the silver ring behind it (either should be fine).
If this fails, but the terminal way works, that's a different bit of
software that we need to figure out. Finally, if those work, we can
look at RStudio, but you might be better served by using their support
systems.

I'm not sure how you got in this mess -- I really don't know what the
"top tool bar" which suggest you update R is, but I and many others
have never had update problems thanks to the wonderful work of Simon
and Prof Ripley et al, and I think you might be convinced there's a
problem where there actually isn't one. You certainly haven't actually
demonstrated existence of a problem to this point. Usually when
programs truly crash on a Mac, there's an option to "report to apple"
and to see system logs: if you are seeing those options, we'd really
appreciate that knowledge, and, even more importantly, the transcript
of the  logs.

And, in the last, just to confirm, you should be installing from this
site and none other:

http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/

There are other mirrors you can use when we get things sorted, but
lets cut out one possible (though not actually all that possible)
source of error for now.

Thanks for your reply,

1) I tried R --vanilla in the terminal and received the below message.  
So it looks like the latest version of R is updated "Roasted  
Marshmallows". Thank you for your explanations, because I only started  
using R this year, an obvious beginner.

Type 'demo()' for some demos, 'help()' for on-line help, or

Type 'q()' to quit R.

2) I would really like to get back to the console with RStudio how I  
had my scripts saved before eventually. Because this is how I know to  
work with R - in RStudio.

3) The q() option does not bother me. Right now there are 3 icons, an  
apple tech told that I must drag the icon to trash and then reload a  
newer version of a program. Please let me know if I should do so.  
(RStudio, R, R64).

4) I tried launching R studio again but as mentioned I was receiving  
the default message which gives me the option to 'relaunch', 'report  
(send error to apple)' or 'cancel'. The problem details :

5) I just typed the commands you suggested in the terminal and they  
worked - all of them.

6) In applications I opened R (silver blue icon) and the console  
opened up, looks like it works fine.

7) All I need now is the RStudio to work as it did and all my  
beautiful scripts to show up as it was before I tried update.

Many thanks, I look forward to hearing from you.

And yes the second time I did upload from:

But only:

R-2.15.1-signed.pkg (latest version)

Please let me know if there is another update for RStudio that I  
should be downloading.

Thank you,

Yes this is good and all as it should be.

As I explained before, this isn't RStudio help. RStudio is a different
product than R made by different people. We've verified that both R
itself and the R GUI work just fine, so you really should be asking at
http://support.rstudio.org/

No, as I've explained. These are different pieces of software which do
different things. They can and should coexist peacefully. (The
difference between R and R64 is the difference between a 32 and a 64
bit build if the apple folks ask -- don't worry about that for now)

Again, this is an RStudio problem, not an R problem. Do be prepared to
supply this to them if they ask however.

So R itself works and the R Gui works. (i and ii in the schema
explained before)

Try reinstalling RStudio now from their binaries. This won't touch
your version of R.

I believe you can recover your scripts from the hidden directory

~/.rstudio-desktop

if you think the new install might clobber them, but I'm not entirely
sure how to go about doing that and, once again, I'd ask the RStudio
people. I've worked with them before and they're very helpful and
quick.

Again, let me just reiterate: R is a backend which can have many
clients. (R.app, Emacs, RStudio, etc.) We've verified both R and R.app
(the GUI) work, so the problem is now certainly in RStudio, not R.

Probably: but, yet again, that's from the RStudio people, which is a
completely different and entirely autonomous organization. I would
like to help you, but the recovery process may well be quite sensitive
and you'll need to check with them to make sure a re-install doesn't
clobber saved user state.

Also: moral of this story =  Save your files in a user directory
instead of trusting a convenience feature and backup!

It sounds like you've already got things sorted, so feel free not to
follow up on this, but this is more Terminal magic.

Open a terminal and you'll already be in ~, so then just type

open .rstudio-desktop

to open a new Finder window in a "hidden" folder where RStudio saves
its configuration files and whatnot. Your scripts are likely in there
somewhere.

I'd also recommend you do look into Dropbox, which will back up your
files instantly whenever you save a change, from anywhere in the world
as long as you have an internet connection.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Ugly default Tk font on Mac OS
Message-ID: <1349684129.9494.71.camel@milan>

Hi!

On Mac OS, since John Fox has removed the code that forced the default
font to be Helvetica (which is a good idea), Rcommander looks terribly
ugly (try by yourself ;-). I've reports of this on at least two
machines, under Snow Leopard.

I've played a bit with fonts on such machines, and I discovered that the
problem is not particular to Rcmdr at all, but that it affects all named
fonts that are created manually.

Rcommander uses a font created that way:
.Tcl("font create RcmdrDefaultFont -size X") # with X a given value

On Mac OS, this command creates a font whose family name is "fixed",
according to tkfont.actual(), and it is somewhat translated to an ugly
font. This is weird, because all default Tk fonts, like TkDefaultFont,
TkTextFont, TkMenuFont... all use "helvetica" as font family, which is a
reasonable default (and not a fixed font). What might be happening on
Macs is that system fonts like "systemSystemFont",
"systemApplicationFont" and friends are _not_ defined correctly, i.e.
they also use "fixed" as font family. So maybe newly created named fonts
inherits from them.

On Linux (and most likely on Windows), the default font family is
correct when creating a named font.


Here's a minimal example that reproduces the issue:
library(tcltk)
.Tcl("font create test")
tkfont.actual("test") # Wrong
tkfont.actual("TkDefaultFont") # OK
tkfont.actual("systemSystemFont) # Wrong
etc.


Regards

Message-ID: <005001cda57a$14641970$3d2c4c50$@mcmaster.ca>

Dear all,

Milan and I have now corresponded about this issue privately, and it appears that there's a difference in the font used under his Mac OS X system (running Snow Leopard) and mine (running Mountain Lion). I currently get the font

	> tkfont.actual("RcmdrDefaultFont")
	<Tcl> -family {Bitstream Vera Sans} -size 10 -weight normal -slant roman -underline 0 -overstrike 0

which (to my eye) is substantially more attractive than what I get when I hard-code Helvetica:

	<Tcl> -family Helvetica -size 10 -weight normal -slant roman -underline 0 -overstrike 0

I don't know what the source of the difference is -- a different X-windows is used for Snow Leopard and Mountain Lion, and Milan and I are in different language locales.

Of course, if there's a way to correct this problem, I'm happy to implement it.

Best,
 John

Just as a point of reference. With a recently installed update to Snow Leopard (yes, I'm way behind that adoption curve) and Rcmdr version 1.8.4 ( I'm not a user and I see this is out-of-date) , I get:

Thanks for this -- it's helpful, though (as you note), the current CRAN
version of the Rcmdr is 1.9-1. The development version, 1.9-2 on R-Forge,
has a number of cosmetic improvements, but not a change to font-handling.

Best,
 John

Interesting. Do you get the same if you run my small test?

library(tcltk)
.Tcl("font create test")
tkfont.actual("test") # Wrong
tkfont.actual("TkDefaultFont") # OK
tkfont.actual("systemSystemFont) # Wrong

Thanks!

For curiosity, I tried this on my Windows 7 machine:

> .Tcl("font create test")
<Tcl> test 

> tkfont.actual("test") # Wrong
<Tcl> -family Arial -size 12 -weight normal -slant roman -underline 0 -overstrike 0 

> tkfont.actual("TkDefaultFont") # OK
<Tcl> -family {Segoe UI} -size 9 -weight normal -slant roman -underline 0 -overstrike 0 

> tkfont.actual("systemSystemFont")
<Tcl> -family Arial -size 12 -weight normal -slant roman -underline 0 -overstrike 0

Note that 1 matches 3 but not 2.

Best,
 John

I don't know if I need to update to the current Rcmdr, since this was earlier done without it being loaded. But I did and then here goes:
> require(Rcmdr)> library(tcltk)
> .Tcl("font create test")
Error in structure(.External("dotTcl", ..., PACKAGE = "tcltk"), class = "tclObj") : 
  [tcl] named font "test" already exists.

<Tcl> -family {Bitstream Vera Sans} -size 12 -weight normal -slant roman -underline 0 -overstrike 0 

I see a "Script Window and an Output Window but admit considerable difficulty with its very non-Mac-ish interface conventions (no cut and paste, unclear what the submit button requires for proper operation);

I seem to be getting the same font being identified when I run these tests from the "Script Window" but the Output Window was not allowing me to copy to the Clipboard in the various efforts I have made. This is the output of the Save Output as ... pulldown menu:

No, it's not needed, the test is plain tcltk.

Weird, because cut and paste should work AFAIK.

Thanks! So it means you really get Bitstream Vera Sans by default in all
possible cases. This is unexpected to me, as I thought this font was not
included by default on Mac OS X. Maybe this is just the default for
X11... I guess you haven't changed your default font for the system
(native Quartz apps)?

Indeed. Segoe UI is apparently the default font on Windows 7, so
TkDefaultFont is the best choice. It probably makes sense to make
RcmdrDefaultFont "inherit" the family from TkDefaultFont on all
platforms then. On Mac OS X, it would use the correct font and fix the
bug I reported where it appears, and on Windows 7 it would use the
default Segoe UI instead of Arial. (On Linux, both give me the same font
family, but none is absolutely right, that's another standardization
issue...)


Cheers

Nope. Haven't changed any of the defaults:

Then, there's still a bug in Tcl/Tk or X11: it would be better if it
used the default sans font, Helvetica, so that it looks as similar as
possible to Quartz apps. But I have no idea where the default of
Bitstream Vera Sans comes from...

Copying from the ATT Research page:

"The current build supports only Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard) or higher. Older versions of OS X are not supported in binary form, but R can be compiled from sources for such legacy OS versions. Last released version for Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) was R 2.10.1."

Also not stated in your description is what CPU you have (PPC vs. x386).

I don't know how easy it will be to get the required Xcode for 10.4.x software which would definitely be needed to compile R from sources. You will need to do some searching at support.apple.com (or whatever that domain might be.) When I updated to 10.6.8 I was told by the Apple rep that they would soon be discontinuing availability of CD copies of that version. I'm pretty sure you will not be able to get that software from Simon or CRAN. You should probably be checking to see if you can get a working copy of Xcode.

I'm not sure if that statement is correct. There are .dmg files at http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/old/ and I'm pretty sure that is how R version for the Mac are distributed. Why not see if you can get satifaction with:

http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/old/R-2.10.1.dmg

The binary Mac versions were cross-compiled for both architectures.

What part of the statement do you deem incorrect? The above statement says that the current R is not available for old OS X in binary form (which is true, the builds of current R only support 10.5+) and that you will have to use the old R 2.10.1 binary on OS X 10.4+ (which I hope is still true - it was tested at the time), otherwise you'll have to compile it form sources (which may or may not work, we can't tell, admittedly, since we have no such systems to test). All that is true as far as I can tell...

Cheers,
Simon

I wrote that after being surprised that there were binary versions on the CRAN page I offered the link to. I probably should have said I was not sure what was meant and that my initial interpretation appeared incorrect. If it means 'no further work will be done on problem corrections but the binaries can still be obtained', then that is different from what I originally thought it to  mean, namely that 'anybody wanting to install R 2.10.1 or other legacy systems will need to compile from source.'

Fair question here, but in this case, I'll actually forward it along
to the R-SIG-Mac list. There are R-SIG groups for Debian, Mac, and
Fedora, though not Windows, just for future reference. You'd probably
be able to get a good answer if we kept it here, but Simon Urbanek
takes care of the R-SIG-Mac and he's the official "Mac Guy" for all
things R and maintainer of the r.research.att.com site so he'll have
the definitive word.

No, the whole directory has disappeared on the host machine.  This was 
not intentional.

Whist this is sorted out, I have put a copy at 
http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/R/gcc-42-5666.3-darwin11.pkg .

You are asked to post Mac-specific questions to R-sig-mac, and I've

The site was inadvertently wiped yesterday and I'm restoring it piece by piece. The nightlies are up but not all tools yet. Sorry for the inconvenience.

What I meant is that if your app is embedding, then you could simply grab the QuartzCocoaView that R creates (it is the content view of the window that R creates over which your app has control) and plug it wherever you want it. That would be a bit of a hack, since you let R do the dirty work and grab the result, but it's the easiest to code. The only drawback is that you cannot subclass QuartzCocoaView in that case (because it is already created at that point). For a more clean solution (that allows arbitrary subclassing) see below.

The initiative comes from R because that is how the devices are created. 
You can use the Quartz API to create your own back-end, just like qdCocoa does - see
https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/src/library/grDevices/src/qdCocoa.m
You can modify quartzWindowWithRect: to use your window (the above code just creates a new NSWindow and a new QuartzCocoaView) or do whatever you want to - e.g, fetch an existing view or so. Note that the device creation is initiated from the R side, so if you use XIB to create a view, it won't become a device until R calls the a Quartz constructor (if you are embedding, you can use ptr_QuartzBackend to re-define the back-end to point to your code). 

I have put a small demo in 
http://svn.rforge.net/osx/trunk/RDemo/
which illustrates how to write your own Quartz backend. It's ugly and very bare-bones since I just hacked it quickly together from current R sources (don't even try to use multiple devices for example), but it should give you an idea.

Cheers,
Simon

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Odd quartz behavior on 24" iMac at 10.7.5
Message-ID: <507CB0EA.4010906@stat.berkeley.edu>

All,

There seems to be something wrong between OS X 10.7.5 and how
quartz reads Apple graphics resolution on 24" iMac (early 2008,
iMac8,1) on R 2.15.1 GUI1.52. On this hardware/OS/R version the
default R plot is a rectangle. On same hardware/R version running
OS X 10.7.4 the default R plot is square as expected. (I don't see
this behavior on 20" iMac once upgraded to 10.7.5.)

On this problematic iMac, if I run quartz.options() without changing
anything I see:

>quartz.options()

$title

[1] "Quartz %d"

$width

[1] 7

$height

[1] 7

$pointsize

[1] 12

$family

[1] "Helvetica"

$fontsmooth

[1] TRUE

$antialias

[1] TRUE

$type

[1] "native"

$bg

[1] "transparent"

$canvas

[1] "white"

$dpi

[1] NA

But any plot, eg.
 >plot (rnorm(10),rnorm(10))

returns an image that is most definitely not a square.

Can anyone help me investigate this? For instance where/how
does R create the plot graphic? Are there specific OS X file(s) that R
reads to generate the plots?

My assumption is that this is an Apple Inc. generated problem
but figured that the R community might be a bit more responsive..

Thanks,
Ray

Can you attach a screenshot? R is simply reading the geometry reported by the OS to adjust the aspect ratio accordingly.

Can you run this in R:

install.packages("inline") # if you don't have inline installed yet
library(inline)
f=cfunction(,'CGDirectDisplayID md = CGMainDisplayID(); CGSize ds = CGDisplayScreenSize(md); Rprintf("%gmm x %gmm\\n", ds.width, ds.height); return ScalarReal(ds.width / ds.height);','#include <ApplicationServices/ApplicationServices.h>')
f()

You should see this on a 24" iMac8,1:

> f()
520mm x 320mm
[1] 1.625

Those are the proper dimensions of the built-in screen.

If that's not what you get, you should be able work around this by setting dpi manually to 94 (it will be slightly off since the native dpi is asymmetric 93.785 x 95.25 but 94 should be close enough to not notice) - either in quartz.options() or quartz().

Cheers,
Simon

Hi Simon,

Thank you very much for your response. I've installed the inline library
and run the function as you wrote. The results are interesting. Following
this procedure on a 24" iMac running OS X 10.7.4 I get this:

 > f()
518.809mm x 320.842mm
[1] 1.617021
 >

which is pretty close to what you predicted. However, doing the same on 
another
24" iMac running OS X 10.7.5 I get this:

 > f()
0mm x 0mm
[1] NaN
 >

which clearly shows a problem. I know that we can set the quartz dpi 
variable
by hand per session or in users' .Rprofile file which will compensate 
for this
problem. But I'd like to find a better solution that doesn't require 
editing any
user file. I suppose this a bug but am not sure if it would belong to R or
to Apple?

Thanks again
Ray

Apple - their CGDisplayScreenSize() is returning bogus result. Just to make sure, please try this in a standalone program w/o R:

disp.c:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <ApplicationServices/ApplicationServices.h>

int main() {
    CGSize ds = CGDisplayScreenSize(CGMainDisplayID());
    printf("%gmm x %gmm\n", ds.width, ds.height);
    return 0;
}


compile and run via

gcc -o disp disp.c -framework AppKit && ./disp



That said, we can work around that bug in R by not using the screen size when it's bogus but falling back to something around 90-100 dpi. In fact, I'm surprised that it doesn't bomb entirely ...

Thanks,
Simon

I've done this. Here is the output

host:~# ./disp
262.194mm x 324.255mm
host:~#

Which doesn't look correct (?).

Ok - now a formal question - are you saying that you/R Team can provide 
a patch
of sorts?

Thanks again Simon,

Is this on the machine that reported 0 in R? Also are you running this as the same user? (I'm a bit wary given the root hash ...).

Good point - I ran disp as root. On the problem host in question I'll run
disp as non-root:

host:/tmp$ ./disp
Oct 17 13:22:02 host.berkeley.edu disp[12852] <Error>: kCGErrorFailure: 
Set a breakpoint @ CGErrorBreakpoint() to catch errors as they are logged.
0mm x 0mm
host:/tmp$

Which is also clearly messed up.

Ok - I'll look into somehow getting this issue in front of Apple. In the 
meantime
We'll hardcode a dpi setting (probably 94) for R on these iMacs.

a bit too vague -- are you using fink (which should give some apt-get options I think), macports, home-brew or what?

The short of it is NO, you will have to say what you want to install on a Mac that is unix enough to make you hope for an apt-like installation and is R related, so we can actually help.

This would be stuff like "sudo apt-get install r-cran-rgeos" please

This is on a MacBook Air with Mountain Lion.

Sorry for the ambiguity.

Not for "regular" OS X. In OS X there are packages, but no central binary repository to download from(except that Apple would argue that the App Store is the equivalent). You simply download packages from the internet (or App Store) and install them instead. See pkgutil for local package management.

If you are happy running a shadow OS in parallel to OS X you can use things like MacPorts, Fink or Homebrew which use similar (or some the same) mechanism as apt/dpkg, but I would advise against it unless you know what you're doing as they all have their problems for the unwary user and affect the entire system.

Cheers,
Simon

are you using the GUI?

if so go to 'packages and data' -> 'Package Installer' -> CRAN binaries

select whatever, make sure to tick 'install dependencies' and there you go.

You could use a different method from a R session running in a terminal, but I think I'd be spoilng the fun if I deprived you of the opportunity to google 'how to install R packages' or something like that.

That is not how you install R packages on (Mac) OS X.

- Start R.app or R64.app.
- Select from the menu Packages & Data, Package Installer
- Click Get List
- Filter with rgeos
- Select it and look in the left bottom panel to decide where you want it installed
- Check Install Dependencies if required and  Click Install Selected

You may have to set your CRAN repository. Goto the menu: R, Preference and click General. The rest is easy.

Hello,
I have just been given an institutional macbook - I'm very used to linux, but some apple things are baffling me (like the lack of sudo apt-get update and upgrade for example).   

I've installed roasted marshmallows, it's very nice.   However, I can't run it from command line (or aquamacs) due to some permissions error.   I've checked both R, the R64 and the symlink as described on the FAQ page.   All the permissions look OK (everyone seems to have x).

The only thing I can think of is that I'm not in the admin group (and can't seem to put myself in that group).    Could this be a chmod issue or am I barking up the wrong tree completely.

Paul

It's called softwareupdate on OS X ... apt is specific to Debian, so, yes, OS X is not Debian :) Just install Debian on the MacBook if you don't want to be baffled, it's possible and some people that buy Macs just for the hardware do it.

We can't tell because you omitted all useful information ... (what error? where? how do you start it?)

typing R in the console gets the error "you don't have permission to use the application R".   the message is on a dialog box that pops up.

the R gui though is marvellous, works fine.   Problem is I can't run r from aquamacs (same error message), or from make.

R will though run as sudo, but that seems like a naughty workround.   But at least it suggests all the paths etc. are correct.

Fairly sure this is all dumb newbie mac user, but I hope I'm not the first.   I couldn't see anything on any helplists anywhere.   The only thing close was to run the "repair permissions" which I've done and a email from you a couple of years ago about mac installer setting permissions.   As I say, I think I've tracked the symlink itself as well as the files it links to /usr/bin/R is itself a symlink to R64.    All three users have an x when you do ls -l , they don't all have r and w. 


Thanks

What exactly happens when you run R in Terminal? Do you still get a dialog box? It's a console application after all ...

To my best knowledge yes, you are - this is not something that usually happens with the CRAN binary .. it's rather odd unless you have some custom setting ... try R --vanilla just in case ...

Thanks very much all, I'm still sure this is mac naivety on my part, but I'm still curious how I've managed to foul up what seems like such a simple procedure.


John's longer point - I'm going to check out removing and re-installing.   I had to enter a system password and checkbox that I wanted all users to be able to use R.   I can certainly use R GUI as myself so don't entirely understand how I gave R gui different ownerships/permissions that R console.

Regarding the other questions (my naive and presumably wrong thought was that I need to put myself as a user in group admin, but I'm not sure that's entirely correct).


John's question
R.home() gives
"/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources"
Checking permissions gives 
pm6-0068:~ phewson$ ls -l /Library/Frameworks/R.framework
total 40
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  admin   24 18 Oct 11:16 Headers -> Versions/Current/Headers
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  admin   30 18 Oct 11:16 Libraries -> Versions/Current/Resources/lib
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  admin   31 18 Oct 11:16 PrivateHeaders -> Versions/Current/PrivateHeaders

drwxrwxr-x  5 root  admin  170 18 Oct 21:22 Versions


Simon's question, yes typing R in the console gives me a the dialog box, but the console does also gives me the following:
/usr/bin/R: line 259: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/bin/exec/x86_64/R: Permission denied
/usr/bin/R: line 259: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/bin/exec/x86_64/R: Undefined error: 
(same for R vanilla)

Davor's question yields:

This is about lattice not using rep() correctly.  There is no '2.16' and 
never will be (see the posting guide).

 From the NEWS for R-devel:

       \item The undocumented use \code{rep(NULL, length.out = n)} for
       \code{n > 0} (which returns \code{NULL}) now gives a warning.

Deepayan is aware of at least some of the uses in lattice, but you could 
report this one too.

It still might not be you... 

I think you still need to tell us a few more details, e.g. the OSX version. However, since you say that the macbook is "institutional", is there a chance that someone tampered with permissions for your login shell? or that the OS has "security features" in place that are getting in the way? Is, BTW, any of this stuff on networked or otherwise specially mounted drives? -- sometimes there's a noexec setting for the entire drive. 

Can you do this:

~ pd$ /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/bin/exec/x86_64/R
Fatal error: R home directory is not defined

(It has to fail like that as the environment is not set up properly, but it would be informative as to whether the program can be started at all.)

Hi,
OS X Lion 10.7.4 (11E53)
mac book pro 15 in ch Mid 2010
Entirely stand alone, no networked drives.   I **should** have admin
rights (I can install software for example), but the nuances of
permissions go beyond both myself at the moment as well as the tech
support I've been pestering.

If I run
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/bin/exec/x86_64/R
I get the permission denied error

If I run
sudo /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/bin/exec/x86_64/R
I get the Fatal error: R home directory is not defined.

(as I'm missing tab completion I also cd'd into /Lib etc. /x86_64 where
sudo R ran fine.

Best
Paul

Are you running any anti-virus software or other haxxies? The thing is that R will not show any dialog box since it is a console tool, so the dialog box has to come from some other software that may be causing the issue in the first place ...

Right, thanks. Finally sank in.
The dialog box looks to me like the Finder icon (I don't know what that means yet, but it doesn't look like the gatekeeper thing which is in newer versions of os x ).   There is sophos on the system and it beyond me to do anything I think.   Anyway, you've given me something to discus with our technical support (like turning sophos off for 2 minutes while I check if that's the problem).   I will email back when it's fixed.

Thanks
Paul

If you look in the list archives you will know that much of

I've put a copy at http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/R/GTK_2.18.5-X11.pkg

Since this is an institutional machine, it occurs to me that it could be  
an ACL issue, where all the permissions look okay, but since ACLs trump  
permissions, it still messes with you. That's what happened to me with my  
institutionally-issued Mac a bit ago, after my university's tech "support"  
upgraded my machine. Fortunately, if I recall correctly you said you have  
admin access, so you should be able to fix it yourself if that's the

But as we said earlier, this doesn't seem a permission issue at the FS level since the error comes from some random place that is not the application itself ... If just FS permissions were the issue, you'd get a bash exec error instead.

Message-ID: <9FF9A923-90FF-46A8-A563-4A2A17434A58@plessthan.com>

R 2.15.1
Lion

Colleagues

In previous versions of OS X, I might do the following:
	1.  create a PDF in R
		pdf(FILENAME)
		plot(1)
		dev.off() 
	2.  open the file using the command 
		system("open ?")
	3.  create the file again (same commands as above).	
The opened file was replaced with the new version.
(This differs from Windows in which the file needed to be closed in order to create a new version)

As of Lion, it appears that something changed.  In some instances, the behavior is identical, i.e., creating the new version of the file results in the open version being replaced with the second version.  However, in some circumstances, I observe the following behavior:
	1.  the original version of the file remains open
	2.  the new version appears as a second instance of Preview
	3.  the system appears to freeze for a few seconds
	4.  Preview is frozen and requires a ForceQuit

Sample code is:
pdf("xx.pdf") ; plot(1); dev.off() ; system("open xx.pdf"); Sys.sleep(3) ; pdf("xx.pdf") ; plot(2); dev.off()

The code above results in the desired outcome and I can't provide a short reproducible example (the problem only happens with extremely large multipage documents).

Does anyone have any thoughts as to whether this is a problem in OS X (Preview) or R?  Any thoughts on how to prevent it from happening?  I suspect that this will be a un-solveable mystery but I thought that it was worth asking.

This may be a consequence of the change in Lion, which introduced Auto Save and Versions (a local version control system) as part of the OS functionality. Note the little pull down menu (downward pointing triangle) to the right of the file name in the Preview title bar when you move the cursor over the file name.

These might be helpful for background:

  http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4753

  http://support.apple.com/kb/PH3729

but the distinctions between the various operations ("Save As", "Duplicate", "Export") can be confusing. "Save As" came back in Mountain Lion if you press the "Alt" key while viewing the File menu in the app.

Using your sample code above, the original file is replaced with the second version when I actually click on the Preview app window, so that it has focus. This is a behavior that has been consistent to me for some time, when using Sweave, for example, even with very large (100's of pages) PDF documents. I have never ended up with a second instance of Preview, when viewing the same PDF file.

You might want to check/change the "When opening files:" options in Preview's Preferences -> General tab to see if that affects the behavior you are observing.

Marc Schwartz

I've tried this on Mountain Lion but do not get two instances of preview.
One instance only. To check which version of the pdf Preview is displaying I changed the second plot command to plot(2,col="red"). Preview does not immediately show the second version (it doesn't reload the file) but when you switch focus to another app and return to Preview you see the changed pdf.
The initial pdf was not a version of the second (red dot) pdf.

I've tried this several times with the same results. One instance and no versions.

Message-ID: <244BFA3AE9F83C4A8261E27189707237010AAB99864C@ASSCCEVS03.sergas.local>

Hi!

I'm happy using RMySQL to access a number of MySQL databases and RJDBC to PostgreSQL ones here, but now I do need to integrate data from SQL Server 10.00.1600.

To the best of my knowledge and after googling for a while, RJDBC is my best option to access SQL Server databases from my Mac OS X 10.6.8 installation running R version 2.15.1 (2012-06-22) --
Platform: i386-apple-darwin9.8.0/i386 (32-bit).

java version "1.6.0_37"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_37-b06-434-10M3909)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 20.12-b01-434, mixed mode)

I'm trying this in R...

> drv <- JDBC("com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerDriver", "/etc/enu/sqljdbc_2.0/sqljdbc4.jar")
> conn <- dbConnect(drv, "jdbc:sqlserver://hostname;integratedSecurity=true", "username", "password")

and getting this exception...

Error in .jcall(drv at jdrv, "Ljava/sql/Connection;", "connect", as.character(url)[1],  :
  com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerException: This driver is not configured for integrated authentication. ClientConnectionId:b62ebeb1-d6b3-47a0-8136-b86b352b4e41


Please, must I be able to access our SQL Server database by modifying/correcting the connection line syntax or am I using a wrong driver/method? If I must be able to connect, please, could you point me to some documentation explaining how to configure this driver to use integrated authentication? I can access this server/database without a glitch using Navicat Premiun on the same Mac OS X box.

Thanks for your help!

Ricardo

This really is a very specialized issue: JDBC access to SQL server. 
It is saying 'jdbc:sqlserver://hostname;integratedSecurity=true' is 
not supported.  Can you not check a non-R JBDC client and ask on a 
JDBC forum?

I do agree. My hope was to find somebody here that is using a similar configuration/environment to see how she/he has worked around this issue. I'll look for more help where you propose and keep this thread posted if I get any solution.

It seems unlikely that the contour functions is performing improperly.

 num [1:96, 1:96] 0.0035 0.0042 0.00489 0.00559 0.00629 ...

My wild guess (in the absence of any specifics about why you thought this was the wrong answer) is that this is due to the fact that matrix indices in R at 1-based, not 0-based as in other languages common among electrical engineers.

And why is this being posted to the Mac-SIG group, anyway? I see no Mac-specific content.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] tcltk does not automatically launch XQuartz
Message-ID: <3ABDFDE4-42E4-49A1-839E-96D321079BAD@stat.unipg.it>

Dear Mac useRs,

I have a problem with tcltk on a Mac running OSX 10.8.2 and R 2.15.1.
Using R.app GUI I got the following:

> library(tcltk)
Loading Tcl/Tk interface ... done
Warning message:
In fun(libname, pkgname) :
  no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable

I was able to solve this by running XQuartz.app before loading the tcltk library. 
However, this doesn't help if I run R from the console. Unfortunately, this is needed if you want to build/check a package that requires tcltk.

Furthermore, in the previous OSX versions I used (both Leopard and Snow Leopard series) when I was in R (both on GUI or console) and I needed the tcltk library, if X11 was not running the system automatically launched the required application. This appears to be changed with Mountain Lion (and Xquartz) but I guess the old behaviour would solve the problem mentioned above.

Thanks in advance for your help.

Luca

You use a different definition for the x in the call to contour, i.e. 
seq(0,1,length.out=(nrow(Electrolyzer))), then you used when you 
computed it, i.e. seq(from=0.05,to=1, by=0.01).

A good practice is to compute the x and y vectors just once, and use the 
outer() function to compute the array.  You may need to use Vectorize() 
to make sure your function works properly in outer().  For example,

Electrolyzer <- outer(etaELEC, FE, function(x, y) 
Ecap(FE=y,etaST=0,etaFC=0,etaELEC=x,etaRP=0.6,etaCOMP=0.95,ENH3=340))

then use etaELEC and FE in the calls to contour.  I would also use 
"add=TRUE" in your calls to contour() if you want those plots overlaid: 
  that will work on any device, not just png():

contour(etaELEC, 
FE,Electrolyzer,axes=FALSE,levels=c(-0.1,0,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5,0.6,0.7,0.8,0.9,1), 
add=TRUE)
contour(etaELEC, 
FE,Electrolyzer,axes=FALSE,levels=c(0.102),col="red",add=TRUE)

Another good practice is to simplify your question as much as possible 
before posting it.  Often you'll discover your own error in the simple 
version, and won't need to post at all.

And finally, as David said, this sort of question should go to R-help, 
not R-sig-mac, unless you think there's something Mac-specific about the 
problem.  But posting a working example is much better than most "first 
posts"; thanks for doing that.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] single-threaded R, 100% CPU with BLAS, vecLib and ATLAS
Message-ID: <DA4D3E11-8A8F-474A-98A6-6A35944343B6@gmail.com>

Hi,

I am trying to run R on my MacBook Pro 2.4 GHz Intel core i5. I am trying to read a csv file, which works fine on my work colleague's machine (under linux) but causes my CPU to go up to 100% and makes the GUI unresponsive and hangs on the command line. Activity monitor indicates there is only one R thread running.

I did see that by default R was using the BLAS library, which is single-threaded, and that there was an option to use vecLib instead. I did this, and 
ls -l /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/lib/libRblas.dylib
does return 
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/lib/libRblas.dylib -> libRblas.vecLib.dylib

I however still see the same behavior: 100% CPU, single thread.

I saw that some MacBook pro (Xeon Nehalem based) had a vecLib bug, so I built the ATLAS library and symlinked R to libtatlas.dylib (unfortunately the pre compiled binairies pointed to in a previous email on the list [1] were not available anymore. Building ATLAS was... fun ;)) I was able to get the shared libraries (using --shared in my config) but still see the same behavior when trying to run my code. I was unsure if I should link to libsatlas.dylib or libtatlas.dylib, so tried both (I guess the latter was the right one though)

I tried building R from the source (specifying -arch x86_64 and --enable-BLAS-shlib to be able to switch libraries), but same behavior and it seems it is an identical version to the prepackaged one (I tried with BLAS, vecLib and ATLAS)

R info: R version 2.15.1 (2012-06-22) -- "Roasted Marshmallows", Platform: x86_64-apple-darwin9.8.0/x86_64 (64-bit)

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Melanie

BLAS will have absolutely no effect on read.table() - it will always be single-threaded and it does not use BLAS. The difference between the two machines may be memory - read.table() is not the most efficient way to load a data set and maybe you're running out of memory (but you didn't tell us how you are loading it, really).

Cheers,
Simon

What exactly is that an estimate of? In R, 1GB of RAM will store ~134Mio datapoints when using numeric matrices/vectors and twice as many as integers or logicals. In practice, you will still need some room for computation on the data, though.

Thanks for the hint Peter, it helps me to solve the problem. 
Among the several proposals the following fixed my problem. From the terminal:

> launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchAgents/org.macosforge.xquartz.startx.plist

then logged out, and back in, and that fixed my problem

Hi Ray and Simon, all,

Thanks for the help. My laptop has 8GB of RAM (my colleague has 12 on his desktop). I ssh'ed into his machine and the whole file loads in not even 2 seconds.
The file is read with mat<-read.csv('test.arff',header=FALSE,sep=',') The arff file is what I use with Weka, which is basically a comma delimited file. It contains around 7.5M datapoints (6200 rows, 1140 columns)

It seems that with 8GB I should be quite ok?

Based on your suggestions I tried with a part of the file only, which does work fine, so it seems that it is indeed a memory problem. Any idea as to why?

Thanks,
Melanie

Hi Ray,

Thanks a lot for your help. I tried to rename the file etc as you suggested below. You are right that the file has a header, its structure is as below:
@relation some string

@attribute ID numeric
@attribute Class {negative,positive}
@attribute Att1 numeric
...
[I have 1140 of those)

followed by a section @data and then the data rows.

It turns out that my colleague had copied the file on his machine and removed the headers manually, which was not done in our common SVN version which is the one I was trying to read. Removing the header solved the issue. 

RWeka looks very interesting, thanks for the pointer.

Cheers,
Melanie

I would also use the word "frame" instead of "mat" as the data will not be a matrix after you call the read.csv function - it will be a frame.  You can turn your frame into a matrix using other R commands if you like.  See this page:

Hi:

I see that R 2.15.2 is now available for the Mac.  In some of the other R mail-lists people have mentioned having to reinstall  packages when they upgraded to 2.15.2.  Is this likely to be the case or should most packages  that worked worked with  2.15.1 still work?

Thanks for any insight.

There are people posting misinformation ....

There is no known need to reinstall CRAN packages for R 2.15.2 from R 
2.15.0.  However, there are packages which have newest versions 
depending on R >= 2.15.2, and others depending on new versions of BioC 
packages which are available in BioC 2.11, which is the default in R 
2.15.2 (as distinct from BioC 2.10 in R 2.15.[01]).  So I would always 
suggest using update.packages() after updating R.

Of course *binary* versions of such packages will only become available 
once the bots are updated to R 2.15.2.  But in a new feature in 2.15.2:

 > install.packages('demography')

   There is a binary version available (and will be installed) but the
   source version is later:
            binary source
demography   1.13   1.14

so you do get told about this.

I strongly prefer using R_NO_REMAP since there are a lot of "gotchas" when using shortened R names including the "error" one.

Unsurprisingly - you can't set R_NO_REMAP for everything since you don't want to set it for the engine itself. What I meant is that I would simply add
#define R_NO_REMAP
before you include any R header or (if you don't use any R headers directly) before
#include "REngine.h"
