Hi,

When I try to load the Geneland GUI in R 2.9.1 for Mac OS 10.4.11 (with X11 installed from the installation disk) it always comes up with the error 
"Loading Tcl/Tk interface ... Error in dyn.load(file, DLLpath = DLLpath, ...) : 
  unable to load shared library '/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.9/Resources/library/tcltk/libs/i386/tcltk.so':
  dlopen(/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.9/Resources/library/tcltk/libs/i386/tcltk.so, 10): Library not loaded: /usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.6.dylib
  Referenced from: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.9/Resources/library/tcltk/libs/i386/tcltk.so
  Reason: no suitable image found.  Did find:
	/usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.6.dylib: mach-o, but wrong architecture
Error : .onLoad failed in 'loadNamespace' for 'tcltk'
Error: package 'tcltk' could not be loaded"

I do not have this problem with my laptop that is running R 2.9.0. Is there some bug in the R2.9.1 version that prevents tcltk from loading? Is there a way to fix this?

Thanks

Yes, re-install X11. You failed to supply any details so we can only  
speculate, but my guess would be that you upgraded from ppc to intel  
at some point (or installed some other X11) and thus your X11 doesn't  
have intel binaries. But, again, without any details (sessionInfo(),  
machine type and preferably output of "file /usr/X11R6/lib/ 
libX11.6.dylib") it's only a wild guess.

Cheers,
Simon

Dear Simon,

On my Mac (10.4.11) I have installed different versions of R and thus 
like RSwitch very much. However, in my case it works only when I am 
logged in as administrator.

Since I am usually logged in as normal user I have to:
logout -> login as admin -> run RSwitch -> logout -> login as user

I know this tool is unsupported but do you think there is a possibility 
for an update?

Best regards
Christian

You can *probably* get this behavior by changing the permissions on  
your R.framework directory. By default, I think it's set to:

drwxrwxr-x  9 root  admin  306 Jun 29 10:39 /Library/Frameworks/ 
R.framework/

Since the RSwitch program monkeys around with which symlinks point to  
what in that folder, you'll need admin rights to use it.

I'm guessing that if you chown or chgrp that directory such that your  
logged in user has the rights to change stuff in there, you can then  
use the app as a non admin .. w/o an app update :-)

HTH,

Hello,

The "ln -s" command you talk about is to make a symbolic link to Komodo 
Edit (its installer fails to do that, despite there are a couple of 
useful command line options provided). Open a terminal window on your 
Mac and type this, providing you installed Komodo Edit.app in 
/Applications (all on one line):

sudo ln -s /Applications/Komodo\ Edit.app/Contents/MacOS/komodo 
/usr/bin/komodo

You will be prompted for administrative password. R can now open 
documents directly inside Komodo.

For your second question, indeed, we should support 64-bit R too, and 
including R64.app and R --arch x86_64/R --arch ppc64. For the moment, 
you can do the changes by yourself like this:

- Open the toolbox in Komodo: View -> Tabs -> Toolbox

- Navigate to SciViews-K/GUI/Menus/R/Start R folder in the toolbox.

- Copy R app (Mac) entry (right-click -> copy in context menu)

- Select 'Start R' folder again and right-click -> paste)

- Select the pasted 'R app (Mac)' entry and right-click -> properties

- In the Properties dialog box, rename it to 'R64 app (Mac)', and in 
Command: change it to 'open -a /Application/R64.app ....'

Restart Komodo Edit. You should be able to connect to your R 64-bit 
application.

P.S.: untested, please report back your results

P.S.2: you should better use the SciViews-Help mailing list 
(http://r-forge.r-project.org/mail/?group_id=194) and/or the feature 
request in the SciViews Tracker 
(http://r-forge.r-project.org/tracker/?group_id=194).

This really ought to be on the r-sig-mac list. I am copying that list  
and follow-ups to any of these comments ought to trim the r-help  
address.

It is certainly true that packages will need to be reinstalled, but I  
am puzzled by the comment about "probably downgrading". My experience  
is that current versions of packages are almost always available on  
CRAN. The R.app 64 bit GUI provides for compiling from source and only  
a few packages fail to compile for the Mac OS X 10.5.x 64-bit  
architecture.

Correct. On a Mac:
x <- matrix(rep(0, 6600^2), ncol = 6600)
 > object.size(x)
[1] 348480200

I am unable to reproduce that problem with "only" 10GB installed.

Some part of your installation is faulty. You should not need to use  
the 64 bit version to get those matrices created. Discuss further on  
the r-sig-mac list.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Unable to find pkg-config during install
In-Reply-To: <4A4C4141.7060808@sciviews.org>
References: <4A4BD685.4010202@ucdavis.edu> <4A4C4141.7060808@sciviews.org>
Message-ID: <F1BF402F-ADA8-441E-AC5A-8635BBB6DB66@comcast.net>

I am getting a error message during an effort to use the Package  
Installer with a source copy of cairoDevice:

* Installing *source* package 'cairoDevice' ...
checking for pkg-config... no
ERROR: Cannot find pkg-config.
ERROR: configuration failed for package 'cairoDevice'
--------
I seem to have pkg-config per locate from the Terminal:

david-winsemiuss-mac-pro:~ davidwinsemius$ locate pkg-config
/Library/Frameworks/GTK+.framework/Versions/2.14.X11/Resources/bin/pkg- 
config
/sw/bin/pkg-config
/sw/share/man/man1/pkg-config.1
/usr/X11/share/man/man1/pkg-config.1.gz
/usr/share/zsh/4.3.4/functions/_pkg-config
------
The UNIX Appendix of the Installation Manual (p 29) says: "Mac OS X  
comes with none of these libraries, but cairo support has been added  
to the binary distribution: pkg-config is still needed and can be  
compiled from the sources. "

But that is not particularly helpful to me. Is there some environment  
variable or path has not been defined properly? I tried downloading  
pkgconfig-0.18 but its README file is not sufficiently detailed for my  
level of understanding of the UNIX underbelly of Mac OS X.

Let's not spend our time and resources thinking about things that are
so little or so large that all they really do for us is puff us up and
make us feel like gods.  We are mammals, and have not exhausted the
annoying little problems of being mammals.

As the error message says: see config.log more more details,
search for "cannot create". It's usually a linking problem,
or a problem with include files, not a compiler problem per se.

Yes, try

Sys.setenv(PATH=paste("/Library/Frameworks/GTK+.framework/Resources/ 
bin",Sys.getenv("PATH"),sep=":"))

(BTW: I'm not quite sure why you would try to compile it from sources  
- it's available in binary from from CRAN).

Cheers,
Simon

Thanks. Unfortunately, I now get a huge number of error messages:

It is and I have cairoDevice 2.9-2 installed, but I got this message  
when I tried to load playwith 0.9-43 when using the 64 bit GUI:

Loading required package: lattice
Loading required package: cairoDevice
Error: package 'cairoDevice' is not installed for 'arch=x86_64'
In addition: Warning message:
In install.packages(c("cairoDevice"), lib = "/Library/Frameworks/ 
R.framework/Resources/library/",  :
   installation of package 'cairoDevice' had non-zero exit status

So I thought I would try to install from source. Wasn't there a time  
in the not too distant past when Mac binary packages in CRAN did not  
support the 64-bit architecture ?

Ah, that explains!  Well, the reason why there are no 64-binaries is  
the above (the GTK+ binary you have doesn't support 64-bit) --  
essentially you have to build the whole GTK+ and all dependencies from  
sources for x86_64 in order to use cairoDevice in 64-bit ...

They do (in the Leopard build), but only where the dependencies are  
met. In this case we have to working GTK+ for 64-bit, so they are not  
built.

Let's not spend our time and resources thinking about things that are
so little or so large that all they really do for us is puff us up and
make us feel like gods.  We are mammals, and have not exhausted the
annoying little problems of being mammals.

Hi,

Isn't it in the directory you're trying to compile from?

But also, here's another idea: I notice /sw/* and /opt/* in your  
include library paths, so I wonder if maybe there is an other gcc  
getting in your way which can't compile to different architecture  
targets, ie: the "-arch i386" stuff you see in the "checking for gcc"  
line here.

If you type "which gcc", which one pops up? Is it the one in /usr/bin,  
or is there another installed via MacPorts of fink?

Just curious,
-steve

Let's not spend our time and resources thinking about things that are
so little or so large that all they really do for us is puff us up and
make us feel like gods.  We are mammals, and have not exhausted the
annoying little problems of being mammals.

Well, it seems like it can't find the right include files it needs  
from your "proj" install, see:

Can you find proj_api.h? Try `locate proj_api.h` ... is it there?

You're using:

> R CMD install --configure-args='--with-proj-include=/sw/include/ 
> proj' rgdal

Depending on what the locate command tells you about where proj_api.h  
is, perhaps you'll need to change that. Would '--with-proj-include=/sw/ 
include/proj' suffice?

Not sure what you'll have to set it to precisely, but that's why the  
compile is bombing on you right now.

I rather meant '--with-proj-include=/sw/include'

well, does

/sw/include/proj/proj_api.h

exist ? And don't you want to say

-configure-args='--with-proj-include=/sw/include/'

Let's not spend our time and resources thinking about things that are
so little or so large that all they really do for us is puff us up and
make us feel like gods.  We are mammals, and have not exhausted the
annoying little problems of being mammals.

Right, so as suggested, instead of:

R CMD install --configure-args='--with-proj-include=/sw/include/proj'  
rgdal

do

R CMD install --configure-args='--with-proj-include=/sw/include' rgdal

Same problem as before -- you're not telling the build system where to  
find your "proj" install.

You told it where the 'includes' are, now you have to tell it where  
the library is -- just *read* the error message:

> Error: libproj.a not found.
> If the PROJ.4 library is installed in a non-standard location,

It's telling you what you need to do, perhaps something like:

R CMD install --configure-args='--with-proj-include=/sw/include --with- 
proj-lib=/sw/lib' rgdal

Does that work?

There is a binary download of rgdal, though apparently not the most 
recent rgdal, at

   http://www.kyngchaos.com/software:frameworks

Which I learned about in the process of installing and using open 
source GIS software QGis:
   http://qgis.org/en/download/binaries.html
which leads to
   http://www.kyngchaos.com/software:qgis
which in turn leads to the above link.

It will be necessary to also (first) install other frameworks that 
this binary of rgdal depends on.

But I do have a functioning rgdal from the above.

Thank you
I tried R-2.9.0.pckg and it did produce the 2.9.1.dmg and the 2.9.0.pckg;
and when 2.9.1 installed it produced 2.9.1
but it was 32bit
Then I tried the R-2.9.0.pckg and it produced both 32 and 64 bit
but was 2.9.0
So I did the curl shuffle (curl -s
http:r.research.att.com/R-2.9-branch-leopard-universal.tar.gz | sudo tar
fvxz - - C/)
And then installed R-GUI-5444-2.9-leopard-Leopard64.dmg
And now have 2.9.1 64bit

I am attempting to install rgl from source within a freshly installed  
R 2.9.1(Patched) from the att.research site.
I am getting this warning at the end of the compilation process:

I understand this is probably an X11 question rather than an R

hoping someone has some advice about how to repair or replace  
libfreetype with one that supports the 64 bit architecture? Or perhaps  
some advice about the best place to pose UNIX fixing problems?

  ^^-- you'll need 64-bit freetype (you are apparently overriding the  
one from X11[which is 64-bit actually] by your /usr/local - it's not a  
good idea unless you have a better one there ...).

Cheers,
Simon

So should I just delete that file in usr/local/? I'm afraid that just  
being told that I need it is not enough for my level of UNIX  
knowledge. I have not knowingly reconfigured my system.

Many thanks to Simon for clearing the way for a successful  
installation of rgl. Moving the existing freetypelib.dylib "out of the  
way" allowed compilation to proceed.

My other difficulty has been installing RGtk2. Using the Package

Loren:

    If you don't absolutely need to use 2.9.1, I'd just make your life 
easier and grab the working (I'm using it right now) R64 2.9.0 (which 
includes the R GUI) in the Leopard build section:

http://r.research.att.com/R-2.9.0.pkg

    Keep in mind if you've already installed R + some packages, you will 
probably need to update (or downgrade) the ones you have...

That will be a really tough one. I don't have a globally working 64- 
bit binary of GTK+, so I think you're out of luck. Building GTK+ and  
all its dependencies in 64-bit from sources is a real pain and very  
error-prone (and somewhat dangerous because you'll need to mask some  
system libraries). I wouldn't hold my breath, but in theory you build  
GTK+ in 64-bit and re-compile RGtk2 with it...

Cheers,
Simon

I have a 2.5 GB file localxxxxxx.tgz, with xxxxxx indicating the date.

You can get it from afp://gifi.stat.ucla.edu and then
from my Public directory in /software. Or from a WebDAV connection to
http://public.me.com/jdeleeuw/software (it's currently gone from  
me.com, but
it will be there again soon).

It contains

a. 64-bit version of R-devel (a.k.a R-2.10.0) with about 600 packages.  
It supports the
    GTK+, tcl/tk, SciViews, etc interfaces.

b. 64-bit version of grass-trunk (a.k.a. GRASS-7.0).

c. Support-libraries and executables, all 64-bit, for ImageMagick,  
freetype, GDAL, proj,
    gsl, gmp, mpfr, fftw, mysql, pgsql, hadoop, root, heasoft, hdf4/5,  
netcdf, graphviz,
    ffmpeg, asymptote, expat, cdd, cfitsio, fontconfig, gc, geos,  
geotiff, gd, tiff, jpeg,
    png, svg, gettext, harminv, iconv, intl, jags, jasper, las,  
pixman, qhull, readline,
    sqlite, szip, tcl/tk, udunits, xml2, gtk2, gdk, atk, glib, cairo,  
pango, glade, git,
    wget, gawk, sed, gs, pkg-config, tramo, seats, x12a, yacas, pvm3  
--- probably more.

d. A 64-bit version of gcc, g++, gfortran 4.2.5 with gomp. Everything,  
including the
    compilers, is compiled with flags "-m64 -O3 -fopenmp - 
mtune=native" -- "native" in
    this context means "nocona", i.e. Intel Core Duo.

e. texlive-2008

It is updated one or twice per week with recent cvs, svn or git  
versions. It installs in
/usr/local. The R is pretty snappy on my machine.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  
Limitations !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

1. This is for CLI junkies. Normal people will stay away from this.

2. The quartz device in R works, but many other things are either GTK 
+, tcl/tk, or even
    Athena.

3. This was compiled on OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard). Your Leopard mileage  
may vary. No
    universal binaries of any sort, of course.

4. Basically it creates a separate 64-bit development environment,  
independent of the Apple stuff
    (and independently, if you want, of the "normal" and nice R and  
GRASS framework-builds and GUIs).

5. This is a large file. After unpacking "du -s /usr/local" says  
14167872 (i.e. 14 GB).

6. I am not really supporting this for users outside my department.  
That would be unwise.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Debugging package code in Xcode?
Message-ID: <4A547B7C.6010600@stats.uwo.ca>

I'd like to use Xcode to debug the rgl package, which is crashing 
sometimes in X11 on OSX.   In the past, I've done this for debugging R 
itself, and have a project set up for that.  I can attach to the process 
ID, and then I see rgl.so is loaded, but I can't see how to set a 
breakpoint in the rgl.so code.

Has anyone else done this before?  Can you point me to step-by-step 
instructions?

You might research gdb fb command (future-break.)  It allows you to  
set a breakpoint in code that is not loaded when the debugger is  
started.  I believe you would have to use the debugger console not the  
GUI with a syntax like "fb rgl.so:function_name".

But it is loaded when I want to set the breakpoint.  I can see the 
source file, set a breakpoint in it, but it doesn't work.  I opened the 
gdb console (thanks for the suggestion),  and I see warnings like

Warning - No location found for "x11gui.cpp:300"

when I try to set a breakpoint in rgl.  How do I tell it where to find 
the location corresponding to that file?

Duncan,

I am not sure that even if you answer these questions that I can help,  
but I'll try.

How did you start gdb?  What commands?  Exactly what process did you  
attach to?  What is in xcode and what is not?

How exactly are you trying to set the break point?  And what does gdb  
respond with when you set it from the command line?

Was anything compiled from xcode?

Was rgl.so compiled with debug symbols turned on?

Was X11gui compiled with debug symbols turned on?

Xcode integration with gdb is a complicated situation.  Just because  
xcode can see something does not really mean that gdb can see it,  
although it usually works with Apple magic.  Are you indicating that  
gdb can see the source file or that xcode can see the source file?

Running x11, R, and rgl all in debug mode would seem a real  
challenge.  Not being an x11 expert, I would also raise the question  
with people familiar with X11 debugging in Mac OS X.  I would start  
with breakpoints only in rgl.so (which is probably what you are trying  
to do) and not x11gui.cpp:300.

You might want to run gdb without xcode and see what's going on.   
You'll have to wade through a bunch of command line stuff, but you do  
get direct feedback without it being absorbed by xcode.

I started R in an xterm, and ran system("ps") to find its process ID.  I 
also ran library(rgl) to get it loaded.

I started Xcode on a project that imports a bunch of files from R and rgl.

I started gdb by menu in Xcode:  Run | Attach to process | Process ID...

This immediately breaks showing a bunch of assembler, because Xcode 
doesn't know the connection between the R source and the binary.  (I 
have had more success doing this on a build of R I made myself, but in 
this case I'm using Simon's, and I get lots of warnings in the gdb 
console that it can't find the source in directories on his system named 
things like /Builds/Rdev-web/QA/Simon/... .  I don't want to debug R 
this time, so I have ignored those.  I want to debug rgl.

All of the rgl source code has been added to the Xcode project, using 
Project | Add to project.

I try to set the breakpoint by clicking in the left margin of one of the 
source files.  I haven't tried doing it from the command line until now, 
but it doesn't like the syntax I was trying.  (How do you specify a 
source file line number?  Alternatively, how do you specify a C++ 
method?  I can set breakpoints at C functions by name, and then Xcode 
does find the right source line, but rgl is mostly C++.

No.

I don't know:  it was compiled by R CMD INSTALL rgl.  I was told a 
couple of years ago that symbols were included by default, but I don't 
know if that's still true.  I think so (based on my success with C 
functions).

It's just part of rgl, so the same answer.

I'm not sure who can see what.  Here's the summary:

  - In the gdb console, I can set a breakpoint at a C function, and 
Xcode will jump to the right source line for rgl.

  - I can't seem to set a breakpoint from the source display.

This has gone above my pay grade.  If it were me I would simplify and  
work all in x11 or all in xcode but not both.  Gdb works great from  
the command line or there are some gui x11 gdb front ends.

Sorry out of ideas and knowledge.

Hi,

This is also above my paygrade so was waiting for Simon or Prof.  
Ripley to chime in, but until then, I do have one suggestion:

>>> Was rgl.so compiled with debug symbols turned on?
>>
>> I don't know:  it was compiled by R CMD INSTALL rgl.  I was told a

I think you need to compile with the -g flag, and you'll probably want  
to turn off optimization (I think R CMD BUILD/INSTALL defaults to -O2)

I think you can probably change these "inline" when you do R CMD  
INSTALL ... , but I just tweak my Makevars whenever I want to compile  
with different settings. I do this be creating the file "~/.R/ 
Makevars". Compiling with debug flags and no optimization, that file  
would look like this:

CC=/usr/bin/gcc -arch x86_64 -std=gnu99
CPP=/usr/bin/gcc -arch x86_64 -std=gnu99 -E
CXX=/usr/bin/g++ -arch x86_64
CXXCPP=/usr/bin/g++ -arch x86_64 -E
OBJC=/usr/bin/gcc -arch x86_64 -std=gnu99
CFLAGS=-g
CXXFLAGS=-g

When I want R to use its default settings, I just comment out the  
lines in that file.

Maybe when you compile with these args, it might get you closer to  
getting your debugger working as you take the rest of the steps that  
you've described.

By the looks of it, you're way more of a C/gdb jedi than I, but  
perhaps this might help.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] X11 plot title font
Message-ID: <C67FB721.13C2%ljxuechina@gmail.com>

Hi everybody

I am using Leopard 10.5.7 with R. I am running from terminal rather than the
R.app GUI. I had some script written under windows, when I was migrating
everything to Mac, I found the graphs I plotted using X11 device behaved
very strange in the title of the graph, which by default were italic. I
check the ?X11, which said the default font for the title (main) is 1 (the
plain text). Therefore, I need to specify font.main=1 in all my plot
functions. I have a bunch of scripts, which will take a lot of time to
change this manually. Is there a better solution for this?

Since I used some X11 specific commands like savePlot, it may be not a good
option for me to set options(device='quartz'), which will cause more work.

Further, I found when I used X11(type='Xlib'), everything worked as the
document said, however, if use X11(), which by default use 'cairo', this
problem came again.  Is there any solutions if I want to use 'cairo' type?

What happens when you look at the contents of:

/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.9/Resources/library/tcltk/ 
libs/i386/

... with either the Finder or using a Terminal session. Is it there?

And when you look at the contents of /usr/X11R6/lib/ with a Terminal

The error message indicates that your machine either does not have X11

Presumably this has something to do with command completion or argument 
hints.  From the "silent = TRUE" error, and your example, I would guess 
you have a function named try(), and the GUI is finding yours instead of 
the one in the base package.

The GUI shouldn't do that, it should look in the right place, but as a 
workaround, you could remove your function named "try", and call it 
something else.

I did have a function named "try" and removing it fixed the problem.

The error message is suggesting there is some problem with loading  
that    file. Have your rebuilt permissions recently? Disk Utility.app  
is the the approapriate starting poit for permissions fixes.

So it is in a location where R is not expecting to find it. I will bow  
out now, since I am not sure that reinstalling X11 in the /usr/ tree  
is the right strategy (or even needed ... see below). There may be a  
path argument that could be set, but I would need to read through the  
available manual material before I maybe got a clue.( And then it  
would still be a guess.)

There is an application named Terminal (or Terminal.app)  which is by  
default in your Applications/Utilities/ folder. It lets you execute  
Unix commands. I am not able to see the /usr/ folder tree with my  
Finder setup, so I can only look at it with Terminal. Maybe someone  
has a hint about how to let Finder peek behind the Unix curtain.

David,

To enable Finder to display 'hidden' files and folders, open a  
Terminal and paste in:

defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE
killall Finder


Finder will restart after the last command.

Note that doing this will also display files that begin with a '.'  
which are normally hidden, but which can be beneficial to show. Files  
such as .RData and configuration files such as .emacs will now be  
visible. However you will also see files such as .DS_Store in each  
folder and on the Desktop, which is a system file for Finder. It will  
also show these hidden files and folders files when installing new  
applications, which risks confusing folks.

To re-enable the default Finder behavior, paste this in to a Terminal:

defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles FALSE
killall Finder


HTH,

Marc Schwartz

Hi Payam

Thanks for your reply. I forgot to mention that I already updated the
X11 from xquartz.macosforge.org, but still the same situation.
Actually, my biggest problem was I used savePlot a lot, which is a X11
specific command. So, I changed to use dev.copy instead of savePlot.
It maybe a good lesson for writing codes that will be run in different
platforms. I was only using Linux and window before, so I didn't have
any problem for the X11 device. However, it seems that the X11 device
in mac system is a little different.

For the same reason, using quartz() is not a good choice, since it is
only available in Mac. I would like to add a small piece of code at
the beginning to the script to set the device options according to
.Platform$OS.type. After that, always use dev.new() to get a new
device. In this way, the code will be more portable.

Regards,
L.J.

Thanks Berend. I was not having difficulties using Terminal sessions  
for navigating the folder tree of hidden folders, but I think this  
will benefit those not raised on CLI systems in the pre-GUI years, so  
I am taking the liberty of copying to the list.

O dear. I've done it again. Reply without looking. So it isn't sent to  
the list.
Maybe a Reply-To field could be  added to the mail header as other

Message-ID: <3F799D98-75B2-4775-9B47-445ABE36E3A1@psu.edu>

Hello,

I'm new to Leopard and I downloaded R to use R/qtl. I've used it with  
Windows just fine... but when I try to install the qtl package on my  
Mac, I receive this message

Error in dyn.load(file, DLLpath = DLLpath, ...) :
   unable to load shared library '/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/ 
Resources/library/qtl/libs/i386/qtl.so':

   Referenced from: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/library/

   Reason: image not found
In addition: Warning message:
package 'qtl' was built under R version 2.10.0
Error in library(qtl) : .First.lib failed for 'qtl'

I downloaded the package from CRAN using the package installer. Is  
there some way I can manually install ? Other bundled packages install  
just fine.

Thanks

Are you running the devel version of R (2.10.0)? Or is something fishy  
going on?

This is the version I'm running:

R 2.9.1 GUI 1.28 Tiger build 32-bit (5444)

I thought that message was odd as well.

OK, how did you install the package? Running:

R> install.packages('qtl')
R> library(qtl)

Works for me.

Perhaps installing it from source might help?

R> install.packages('qtl', type='source')

It seems that somehow the package you installed has a hard link to R  
2.10? Not sure how that would happen.

Unable to reproduce while running 2.9.1 under MacOS X 10.5.7. Just  
installed the binary from CRAN and it loads without complaint or  
warnings. Are your sure you have your Package Installer pointed at the  
correct repository? I use http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/R/CRAN/

Greetings

I have a Mac PowerBook with 10.4.11 that did not have R on it but it did
have X11 1.1.3 - Free86 4.4.0 but no Xcode Tools

So I installed R-2.9-branch-48932.dmg

Then with the GUI and Package Manager tried to install tcltk; got the same
error message you did

Then installed tcltk-8.5.5-X11.dmg; and the error went away and install
proceeded to done

This would suggest install from scratch, tho painful, would solve the
problem

Not sure, and I observed the same version on the binary package  
installed from CRAN with my 64bit R installed in just the manner you  
describe. I can report that compiling 0.1.9 from source using the R64  
GUI Package Installer succeeds. There were a lot of notes of the  
following sort; but no errors:

Message-ID: <D3156C00-B6E2-4B5E-BBD9-941EFE9FDA91@biostat.wisc.edu>


I would like to continue the thread initiated by Matthew Kinkade,  
concerning a problem with the CRAN binary of my "qtl" package.

If one uses install.package("qtl"), with apparently any mirror, the  
Mac binary install is for the previous version of the package (1.11-12).

And it seems that the binary at either of the following

   http://cran.us.r-project.org/bin/macosx/universal/contrib/r-release/qtl_1.12-26.tgz
   http://cran.us.r-project.org/bin/macosx/universal/contrib/r-release/qtl_1.12-26.tgz

were mistakenly built with 2.10.0 rather than 2.9.1, and so loading  
the library gives the error that Matthew Kinkade reported (with a  
dyn.load error and a reference to R version 2.10).

I install the above directly with, for example

   install.packages("qtl", contriburl="http://cran.us.r-project.org/bin/macosx/universal/contrib/2.9 
")

Who should I talk to about getting the package on CRAN re-built?  Does  
anyone know why install.packages("qtl") grabs the previous version of  
the package and not the most current one?

Thanks,
karl

Me. I was at the useR/DSC and in the meantime something went horribly  
wrong with the package builds since suddenly all packages have been  
built with R-devel instead of R-release. I have started a complete re- 
built, but it can take 1-2 days before it's done and propagated  
through the mirrors. Then I'll investigate the cause.

If you referring to 64-bit builds then it's likely that the builds  
have not been run recently. I'll verify that part also tomorrow.

Simon

It turns out that qtl was one of those unlucky packages that had  
dependency issues, so it wasn't re-built (there were five others)  
since the R-devel issue fix.

The builds were down due to a reboot of the 64-bit build machine -  
those are not quite automated (because it's not a dedicated machine),  
so I had to start them up manually. The updates should catch up soon.

No (assuming you mean "where can I download libR compiled as a static  
library"). On Mac OS X the binaries are distributed as a framework  
which is by definition dynamic, so we don't use static version of  
libR. You can try to compile libR yourself as a static library, though.

Hi Rob

XCode (3.1) actually.

I say that. But since I'm (very) new to AppleScript, I don't know how  
to make it use a highlighted piece of code instead.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Problem viewing silhouette plot in Adobe Acrobat
Message-ID: <BA9312A5-FA37-4B37-BBAC-EA279F906E2C@gmail.com>

I'm having a problem viewing a silhouette plot created as a pdf file  
in Adobe Acrobat.  The code below produces a silhouette plot which,  
when saved as a pdf file, has bars that are not visible in Adobe  
Acrobat. A similar problem was noted earlier in the archives (from  
which I took this code) but for a png file. The archive emails  
suggested it may have been a resolution problem however did not have a  
simple workaround, which I assume may exist.

Note also that the bars of the silhouette plot below are viewable in  
the MAC "preview" app.

      library(cluster)
      nmat <- matrix(rnorm(2500*300), ncol=300, nrow=2500)
      rmat <- matrix(rchisq(1000, 300, 50), ncol=300, nrow=1000)
      mat <- rbind(nmat, rmat)
      pr <- pam(mat, 2)
      plot(silhouette(pr))

Any help would be appreciated,

Many thanks,
Joe Retzer

Hi,

I never ever use Acrobat Reader on Mac, try Skim or anything else.

Best, Andrej

Rob,

Thanks a lot, this works perfectly; at least, with only one instance  
of R running. This is rather logical. But nevertheless, since I  
regularly use several instances in parallel, I should once do  
something about this issue. If anyone has ideas, they are warmly  
welcome! Probably something like "last used" / "frontmost" instance.

Just for the protocol, if somebody else is interested as well:

Change
> 		tell process "SubEthaEdit"
to
		tell process "Xcode"

For the keyboard shortcut, you have to go to XCode Preferences and  
disable Cmd+Return in the "Build" menu in "Key bindings" for "Build  
and Go". Go to the Script menu, choose "Edit user scripts", press the  
"+" and "Add new script file". Add your script and the keyboard  
shortcut.

Cheers again, Gregor.

The solution to the readline problem was to remove all conflicting
libreadline.* on
the system.  However, now similar problems are cropping up with libiconv

you should 'make docs' now ...
building/updating package metadata ...

installing a fresh 32/64-bit libiconv and removing all conflicting
versions has not helped.

now it seems that by using gcc-4.2 to build libiconv in a non-central
place and using
DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH to find it, and using gcc-4.2 to compile R, all is well.

FWIW  suspect that your system is pretty badly messed up with all the  
3rd-party stuff you installed, because our 64-bit binaries don't need  
any of this... see
http://r.research.att.com/

Also note that messing with DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH is really dangerous and  
causes a lot of problems since it overrides *all* system path searches  
(unlike LD_LIBRARY_PATH on Linux).

Cheers,
Simon

i'm aware of the r.research.att.com site -- i am working with what i
believe to be a relatively clean (out of the box
only a couple of weeks, some fink extensions) macosx 10.5.7 with Xcode 3.1.2

i won't deny that it is messed up but are there any ways of stating
minimal conditions
on the state of OSX needed to get a good 64 bit build?  would xcode
3.1.3 make a big difference?
looks like something much earlier is adequate at your place.

thanks

I am using

configure --with-aqua --with-blas='\''-framework vecLib'\'' --with- 
lapack --prefix=/usr/local/R --disable-R-framework --with-readline -- 
with-cairo --enable-memory-profiling --enable-R-shlib --x-includes=/

darwin10 --host=x86_64-apple-darwin10 --target=x86_64-apple-darwin10

with OS X 10.6 and a GNU svn build of gcc-4.2 and gfortran-4.2. The  
resulting R has the quartz device as well, but cannot be used directly  
with R.app. It also builds with the gcc-4.2 that comes with Xcode 3.2,  
which I use for OBJC anyway, and maybe with Simon's gfortran (haven't  
tried). Of course this is not a universal binary. I don't think 10.6  
or Xcode 3.2 are essential.

My C, CXX, F, FC flags are

-m64 -O3 -fopenmp -mtune=native

and my LDFLAGS are

-m64 -fopenmp

For otool -L libR.dylib I get

libR.dylib:
	libR.dylib (compatibility version 2.10.0, current version 2.10.0)
	/System/Library/Frameworks/vecLib.framework/Versions/A/vecLib  
(compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 268.0.0)
	/usr/local/lib/libintl.8.dylib (compatibility version 9.0.0, current  
version 9.2.0)
	/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreFoundation.framework/Versions/A/ 
CoreFoundation (compatibility version 150.0.0, current version 549.0.0)
	/usr/local/lib/libreadline.6.0.dylib (compatibility version 6.0.0,  
current version 6.0.0)
	/usr/lib/libicucore.A.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current  
version 40.0.0)
	/usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current  
version 123.0.0)
	/usr/local/lib/libiconv.2.dylib (compatibility version 7.0.0, current  
version 7.0.0)

Of course cairo, tcltk, jpeg, png, ... use additional stuff from /usr/ 
local.

Why am I using this instead of Simon's excellent work ? I have no  
idea. It feels a bit embarrassing.

Thanks, Jan.  Here's the output of otool for my new libR

bash-3.2$ otool -L libR.dylib
libR.dylib:
        libR.dylib (compatibility version 2.10.0, current version 2.10.0)
        /usr/local/lib/libreadline.6.0.dylib (compatibility version
6.0.0, current version 6.0.0)
        /usr/lib/libiconv.2.dylib (compatibility version 7.0.0,
current version 7.0.0)
        libRblas.dylib (compatibility version 0.0.0, current version 0.0.0)
        /usr/local/lib/libgfortran.2.dylib (compatibility version
3.0.0, current version 3.0.0)
        /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreFoundation.framework/Versions/A/CoreFoundation
(compatibility version 150.0.0, current version 476.18.0)
        /usr/lib/libicucore.A.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0,
current version 36.0.0)
        /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0,
current version 111.1.4)
        /usr/local/lib/libgcc_s.1.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0,
current version 1.0.0)

Any obvious problems?

Simon's binaries have been great; I am just trying the source build to
get more rapid access
to changes to devel.

One item that may be noteworthy -- for the new build,

> sessionInfo()
R version 2.10.0 Under development (unstable) (2009-07-24 r48993)
i386-apple-darwin9.7.0

locale:
[1] C

attached base packages:
[1] stats     graphics  grDevices utils     datasets  methods   base
> .Machine$sizeof.pointer
[1] 8

what must be done to get the i386- prefix corrected?

Well, i386 is not 64-bit.

 > sessionInfo()
R version 2.10.0 Under development (unstable) (2009-07-25 r48994)
x86_64-apple-darwin10

Try

 > file libR.dylib
libR.dylib: Mach-O 64-bit dynamically linked shared library x86_64

See the last three flags in my configure statement.  My gcc-4.2 was
configured with the same flags

../gcc-4.2/configure --enable-languages=c,c++,objc,obj-c++,fortran \
    --build=x86_64-apple-darwin10 --host=x86_64-apple-darwin10 -- 
target=x86_64-apple-darwin10

Don't know if this is necessary, but it is sufficient.

Vince

I am building a 64bit version of R using only Xcode 3.1.2 as well as  
the gfortran that Simon provides. This is on OS X 10.5.7. It is an old  
installation, but I have only installed very few programs from source  
(and have never used fink nor darwinports), like graphviz and similar  
non-system-"like" programs. I have never had any problems with  
readline or iconv.

I also have the i386 message on startup, but my sizeof.pointer is 8.

My otool output is

grue:~/Work/readbias/paper/> otool -L /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/ 
Versions/2.10/Resources/lib/libR.dylib
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.10/Resources/lib/libR.dylib:
	/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.10/Resources/lib/ 
libR.dylib (compatibility version 2.10.0, current version 2.10.0)
	/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.10/Resources/lib/ 
libRblas.dylib (compatibility version 0.0.0, current version 0.0.0)
	/usr/local/lib/libgfortran.2.dylib (compatibility version 3.0.0,  
current version 3.0.0)
	/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreFoundation.framework/Versions/A/ 
CoreFoundation (compatibility version 150.0.0, current version 476.18.0)
	/usr/local/lib/libreadline.5.2.dylib (compatibility version 5.0.0,  
current version 5.2.0)
	/usr/lib/libicucore.A.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current  
version 36.0.0)
	/usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current  
version 111.1.4)
	/usr/lib/libiconv.2.dylib (compatibility version 7.0.0, current  
version 7.0.0)
	/usr/local/lib/libgcc_s.1.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current  
version 1.0.0)

Hmm, I am wondering why it is linking to libgxx_s.1.dylib in /usr/ 
local/lib and not in /usr/lib, and similar with libreadline. Could  
that be leftovers from an old GCC from Simon? Or an old(er) R install  
from the CRAN binary? I certainly never compiled readline myself.

My point was not that you should be using the binary, but rather that  
you must have some issue in your setup since the nightly 64-bit builds  
compile cleanly without any problems.

No, any Xcode 3.x will do. The problem is in your 3rd party stuff  
(apparently readline as you found yourself - and I don't know why you  
had issues with system iconv which works for me...)

That is just cosmetics - you can change that with something like -- 
build=x86_64-apple-darwin`uname -r` but it has no practical effect.

You can use either the CRAN gfortran (FSF build) in which case you'll  
get /usr/local/lib/libg* or you can use the gcc-4.2 add-on fortran  
which doesn't use /usr/local (as the instructions say you must remove  
the CRAN one if you want to use it). For my 64-bit build I'm using the  
latter since it seems more clean.
As for readline - there is no readline on OS X (for licensing reasons  
- it uses libedit instead), so you must use your own if you want it.  
You could use a static build to avoid the /usr/local dependency. (For  
CRAN R we just move it inside R and change the path to it).

Simon

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Problem with multicore/doMC/foreach combo on Leopard
Message-ID: <148DFC58-2154-4F99-B77A-FF1143D7F09B@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm posting this here first because (i) this might be a problem  
specific to macs, and (ii) Simon is the maintainer of the multicore  
package.

I'm using the doMC package to use the multicore library as a backend  
for the foreach library.

Every now and again  I'm getting mess-load of these errors when I run  
a new "multicore task" via:

foreach ( ... ) %dopar% {
    ...
}

That look like so:

=== Error ===

  *** caught segfault ***
address 0x1c86b7d80, cause 'memory not mapped'
The process has forked and you cannot use this CoreFoundation  
functionality safely. You MUST exec().
Break on  
__THE_PROCESS_HAS_FORKED_AND_YOU_CANNOT_USE_THIS_COREFOUNDATION_FUNCTIONALITY___YOU_MUST_EXEC__ 
() to debug.
The process has forked and you cannot use this CoreFoundation  
functionality safely. You MUST exec().
Break on  
__THE_PROCESS_HAS_FORKED_AND_YOU_CANNOT_USE_THIS_COREFOUNDATION_FUNCTIONALITY___YOU_MUST_EXEC__ 
() to debug.

==========

I'm guessing it might be mac specific due to (i) reference to  
CoreFoundation, and (ii) this answer given by Scott Lahteine in this  
thread:
http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=1209537&tstart=0

Which I'm pasting here:

======
This is caused by programs that use the fork() or daemon() function in  
combination with higher-level APIs. In Leopard you cannot use the  
CoreFoundation (CF...) APIs on the child side of a fork() without  
following it with an exec*() function. This has always been true, but  
Leopard is much more stingy about this kind of thing.

To solve this issue, uninstall all third-party drivers and system  
customizers, then reinstall them with the latest versions, and make  
sure those versions have been updated for Leopard. Any drivers and  
background software that use CF but haven't been updated for Leopard  
will continue to output these messages, even though they may function  
fine.
======

Does this suggest that the multicore package needs some updating for  
leapord, or am I barking up the wrong tree? I don't see (nor would  
have expected to see) any calls to CoreFoundation specific API's in  
the multicore::fork.c file, so I'm not sure what's up since neither  
doMC or foreach have any C code in them.

I'm running OS X.5.7 and 64-bit R 2.9.1. sessionInfo() is pasted below

I'll ask again in the main R-help if that's more appropriate.

Thanks,

-steve

I am going to make the presumption that you are generally familiar  
with Emacs and the ~/.emacs configuration file. Note that by default  
on OSX, hidden files and folders (eg. system files/folders and files  
beginning with a period) are not shown in Finder.

The easiest approach to the problem is to [create and] modify your  
~/.emacs file so that it has an entry that points to the version of  
ESS that you want to use. Since ESS will almost certainly be updated  
before Aquamacs releases new versions, this enables the two to be  
independent of each other.

So, download the ESS 5.4 tarball into Downloads. Create a folder there  
called 'ESS', move the tarball there and untar it so that it now  
creates a path called "/Users/YourUserName/Downloads/ESS/ess-5.4".  
Then in your ~/.emacs file, put the following line:

   (load "/Users/YourUserName/Downloads/ESS/ess-5.4/lisp/ess-site")

In both instances, replace 'YourUserName' with your home folder name  
(eg. /Users/dalesteele/...).

If you prefer to store things outside of the Downloads folder, modify  
the above path information as appropriate.

That's basically it.  As new versions of ESS become available, edit  
the above line in ~/.emacs so that it reflects the new ESS version's  
folder tree which will be version specific.

Also, as an FYI, there is an ESS specific list:

I can add/delete rows using the icons with no problems in the editor.  
Attempting to add columns with the icons, however, results in this  
error message:

Error in edit.data.frame(pub09)  :
SET_VECTOR_ELT() can only be applied to a 'list', not a 'character'

Then R shows the beach ball and never resolves the difficulty. And it  
shows further strangeness: if the edit window is over the console, all  
text in the console below is erased. I end up having to force quit  
every time.

This is only a bother; the datafile isn't affected nor the  
environment. Besides, I usually work on my data in a spreadsheet, then  
import. Still, if the editor is to be used for classes, I need to find  
out why this is happening. I'm guessing it is due to character strings  
in the datafile, but I can't be sure of that given the circumstances.

Model: MacBookPro2,2, BootROM MBP22.00A5.B07, 2 processors, Intel Core  
2 Duo, 2.33 GHz, 2 GB
R:  R 2.9.1 GUI 1.28 Tiger build 32-bit (5444)

Hope I've given enough data to make the problem clear.

Tracy,

thanks, this should be fixed in tonight's R.app GUI, so please try the  
fixed R.app tomorrow.

Thanks,
Simon
