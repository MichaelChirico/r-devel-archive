Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] gui console Up-arrow bug?
Message-ID: <4A9DB206.9030109@witthoft.com>

Hi,
I have a iMac w/ 10.5.8, Intel core 2 duo.   Both with 2.9.1 and 2.9.2, 
I have the following problem.  When I hit  the up-arrow key , the r.app 
console echoes back the previous command, but it includes a carriage 
return.  If I hit Delete, the cursor moves to the end of the echoed command.
Apologies if this has already been reported, but I wasn't paying 
attention to much last month.

So, is this on the list  of bugs to address, or am I doing something 
else stupid? (I've got that darn Apple mini-keyboard, if that matters).


thanks
Carl

OK,
I managed to track down the advice from last Feb to "clean up history" 
and now all is fine.  Darned if I know why/ how that got turned off.

What is the exact configure command you're running? I suspect that  
your problem is a 32-bit vs 64-bit mismatch, because SL changed the  
gcc default to 64-bit whereas the gfortran default is 32-bit, so you  
have to make sure your archs match (depending on which you actually  
want to build) - ideally you should specify -arch for all compilers  
(as the CRAN binary does - also see the FAQ).

Cheers,
Simon

There appears to be an Apple-supplied gfortran in /usr/bin now, but it  
is i386 arch rather than 64-bit. I'm not sure if you can use it to  
build a 64-bit R or not. It is also version 4.2.1.

I suspect you may have installed the Leopard gfortran-4.2 previously  
and then upgraded your OS and Xcode (there is no gfortran in stock  
Xcode 3.2). That will work, but it is 32-bit by default since it comes  
from Xcode 3.1.x which was 32-bit by default (you can still compile 64- 
bit with it by using -arch x86_64).

Cheers,
Simon

Hi Tony and Simon,

 	I was having this trouble today/yesterday and have been following
along on this thread. The solution I found was to add this to my
./configure:

LDFLAGS="-m64 -L/usr/lib/gcc/i686-apple-darwin9/4.2.1/x86_64 -lgfortran"
and
F77="gfortran -arch x86_64"

...this gets me through the "can't make mixed C/Fortran code" errors. However, 
through one hoop of fire and I'm confronted by another:

checking for iconv.h... yes
checking for iconv... no
checking for iconvlist... no
configure: error: --with-iconv=yes (default) and a suitable iconv is not
available

...this strikes me as odd. The relevant lines from the config.log file are:

configure:39212: gcc -std=gnu99 -o conftest -O3 -fopenmp -mtune=native -m64  -m64 -L/usr/lib/gcc/i686-apple-darwin9/4.2.1/x86_64 -lgfortran conftest.c -lm >&5
conftest.c: In function 'main':
conftest.c:189: warning: passing argument 1 of 'libiconvlist' from
incompatible pointer type
Undefined symbols:
   "_libiconvlist", referenced from:
       _main in cc2XgkAg.o
ld: symbol(s) not found
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status

However:

swiss:R-2.9.2$ nm /usr/lib/libiconv.dylib | grep _libiconvlist
00008807 T _libiconvlist

...I'm not sure where else configure could be trying to find libiconv, but
running "locate libiconv" shows versions in
/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.6.sdk/usr/lib/ also, which also show _libiconvlist
when I nm them.

Any suggestions? I'm not sure how to further debug this...the symbols are
there.

Cordially,
Adam

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Default Folder 4.3 problem
Message-ID: <p06240816c6c74e8ed7ae@[192.168.11.3]>

I've noticed recently that R crashes some way into a session when I 
go to open a file using the toolbar icon. I use Default Folder 4.3, 
and the open file window is open when R crashes behind it. It doesn't 
happen the first few times I open a file, so I can't exactly 
reproduce the problem. But it seems likely to relate to Default 
Folder.

This is the system information from the latest crash.

Thanks for your thoughts.
Tim Cole

You should not touch LDFLAGS and besides F77 you'll also need to set FC.

check /usr/local/lib that is the most common problem area ...

>From configure --help:
   LDFLAGS     linker flags, e.g. -L<lib dir> if you have libraries in a
               nonstandard directory <lib dir>

...the gfortran library lives in a nonstandard directory, which is why I put
the -L there... so I then moved -lgfortran to LIBS='-lgfortran' and things
broke in the same way, as did moving the -L...-lgfortran there.  Both of
these need to be passed to the linker when mixing C/Fortran code.

It also throws the error "Maybe check LDFLAGS for paths to Fortran
libraries?" which is what tipped me off to the fact that I should provide a
link to the Fortran libraries in LDFLAGS.  If this is incorrect, please let
me know where to put them instead (and consider updating the configure
script).

I had, and there was no libiconv there.

I eventually solved this problem by upgrading fink to the 64bit version and
installing libiconv and adding CPPFLAGS="-I/sw/include" and adding -L/sw/lib
to LDFLAGS, forcing it to link against the new library. It seems like the
Apple libraries should serve the purpose, but for whatever reason they did
not.

My current problem is that, during make, R complains about the lapack.so
file it has compiled from my lapack libraries (I configured with
--with-lapack="-L/usr/local -llapack -lptf77blas -lcblas -lpthread -latlas"
and a similar --with-blas):

Warning in solve.default(rgb) :
   unable to load shared library '/Volumes/Tubby2/nobackup/R-2.9.2/modules//lapack.so':
   dlopen(/Volumes/Tubby2/nobackup/R-2.9.2/modules//lapack.so, 6): Symbol not found: _cblas_cdotc_sub

   Expected in: flat namespace
  in /Volumes/Tubby2/nobackup/R-2.9.2/modules//lapack.so
Error in solve.default(rgb) : lapack routines cannot be loaded
Error: unable to load R code in package 'grDevices'
Execution halted

...that said, I understand that --with-lapack is "not recommended" in the
admin manual, so I'm pretty much on my own here, but I'd be interested if
you have an idea or two about what might be going on. _cblas_cdotc_sub is
indeed in my lapack.a file (but not the lapack.so file R refers to), and I
can use _cblas_cdotc if I write some simple c code and link it against
lapack using the same flags as noted above.

My interest, really, is in whether ATLAS's LAPACK-tuning system (which is
pretty new) actually leads to speed improvements in R.  So, I don't
desperately need to use it, but am still concerned that a compile that used
to run smoothly no longer does.

Can you give us an example of text that won't plot?  I just did the  
same (installed SL as an upgrade) and text
plots fine.

Hi Simon, Tony, and anybode else who attempts to complie 2.9.2 for
themselves on Snow Leopard,

The configure line which eventually led to R configuring, building, and
running was this:

./configure --prefix=/usr/local --with-x --disable-R-framework --enable-threads=posix --without-aqua --with-lapack=" /usr/local/lib/liblapack.a /usr/local/lib/libptf77blas.a /usr/local/lib/libptcblas.a -lpthread /usr/local/lib/libatlas.a " --with-blas=" /usr/local/lib/liblapack.a /usr/local/lib/libptf77blas.a /usr/local/lib/libptcblas.a -lpthread /usr/local/lib/libatlas.a " CFLAGS="-O3 -fopenmp -mtune=native -m64" CXXFLAGS="-O3 -fopenmp -mtune=native -m64" FFLAGS="-O3 -fopenmp -mtune=native -m64" LDFLAGS="-m64 -L/sw/lib -L/usr/X11R6/lib -L/usr/lib/gcc/i686-apple-darwin9/4.2.1/x86_64 -lgfortran" F77="gfortran -arch x86_64" CPPFLAGS="-I/sw/include" FC="gfortran -arch x86_64" FCFLAGS="-O3 -fopenmp -mtune=native -m64"

...dropping the --with-blas and --with-lapack items also lets R compile fine
(but see benchmarks below). Note also that I have libreadline and libiconv
installed in the /sw tree using 64-bit Fink for Snow Leopard...you'll need
64bit versions of readline and iconv to compile R; check out
/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.6.sdk/usr/lib maybe.

The one oddity is that when I pass

--with-blas="-L/usr/local/lib -llapack -lptf77blas -lptcblas -lpthread -latlas"
(and --with-lapack the same, or one and not the other)

...the build fails in the manner described in my last message (lapack.so,
compiled by R, ends up not containing the functions it should), while if I
explicitly list the libraries:

--with-blas=" /usr/local/lib/liblapack.a /usr/local/lib/libptf77blas.a /usr/local/lib/libptcblas.a -lpthread /usr/local/lib/libatlas.a

...it builds successfully. Not sure what this portends.

Also, I have done some benchmarking to see how much faster R is (on my Mac
Pro, dual quad-core Xeon @ 2.8GHz, 6G RAM) when I go through all this
trouble:

(benchmarked using http://r.research.att.com/benchmarks/R-benchmark-25.R)

nightly build
(http://r.research.att.com/R-2.9-branch-leopard-universal.tar.gz, built Sept
5 2009, run with --arch x86_64):
Overall mean (sum of I, II and III trimmed means/3)_ (sec):  0.835276859437347

my build, no BLAS or LAPACK:
Overall mean (sum of I, II and III trimmed means/3)_ (sec):  1.83643467491601 
(This build did consistently better on non-matrix math, FAR worse on the matrix math)

my build, BLAS, no LAPACK:
Overall mean (sum of I, II and III trimmed means/3)_ (sec):  0.760949143043198 
(outperforms nightly on most metrics, underperforms on none, outperforms no-blas on all)

my build, LAPACK & BLAS:
Overall mean (sum of I, II and III trimmed means/3)_ (sec):  0.70660451743888 
(outperforms everything else on most metrics, underperforms on none)

So it seems that letting ATLAS compile your BLAS and LAPACK (Atlas 3.9.14
does this), plus adding optimization flags, leads to a 15% improvement over
the nightly build (when using this specific benchmarking system, ymmv
depending on what functions you actually use R for).

Not really - it's the compiler library directory, i.e. where the  
compiler looks for its internal libraries. It is never used  
explicitly. The problem is that you're mixing compilers - you have a  
Leopard gfortran (see my response to John - you have the same problem)  
and SL gcc. That is not recommended and is likely to break in more  
places.

You should get a working gfortran instead - this is a problem in your  
setup, not configure. Unfortunately Apple has broken fortran in the  
gcc-4.2 tree so I don't have a working gfortran binary for Xcode 3.2,  
so please use the gfortran 4.2.3 from CRAN.

Oh, fink? Ok, that explains it all :).

They do, but fink overrides the look up sequence since most of its  
stuff is incompatible with the system versions (which is why it causes  
such a havoc).

I would strong suggest *against* what you're doing, your configuration  
is far from any normal SL system. You're clearly free to use it for  
yourself but is not something any R-SIG-Mac users should follow. The  
setup is incompatible with CRAN and anything we build. (There are many  
reasons - stating with disabling aqua, using 3rd party BLAS (which is  
not a good idea if you want speed since vecLib is highly optimized)  
and mixing in fink (again, a really bad idea for any normal user)).

I see that the most common mistake here is to use Leopard Xcode 3.1  
fortran which is NOT meant to be used with SL and Xcode 3.2. To if you  
upgrade from Leopard and Xcode 3.1, make sure you delete the Xcode 3.1  
fortran as Xcode 3.2 is NOT able to upgrade it. Use the gfortran 4.2.3  
from CRAN instead - it works just fine and no special flags are  
necessary for SL (except for the mandatory -arch).

Cheers,
Simon

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] INFO: Compiling R on Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard
Message-ID: <1932ADF8-4E75-494A-8380-F1FF3B8DEBFB@r-project.org>

If you are running Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard = SL henceforth) it is  
easy to compile R, but there are a few pitfalls especially for users  
that upgrade from Leopard.

(Side note: there is no need to compile your own R, all binaries  
including the 64-bit Leopard binaries from
http://r.research.att.com/
and corresponding binary packages from CRAN are compatible with Snow  
Leopard).


On a *clean* SL system (fresh install):

* install Xcode 3.2 (from SL DVD)

* install gfortran 4.2.3 from CRAN
   http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools/gfortran-4.2.3.dmg

To compile 64-bit, use

../R-devel/configure r_arch=x86_64 CC="gcc -arch x86_64" \
  CXX="g++ -arch x86_64" F77="gfortran -arch x86_64" \
  FC="gfortran -arch x86_64" OBJC="gcc -arch x86_64" \
  --x-includes=/usr/X11/include --x-libraries=/usr/X11/lib

make -j8 && make install

(replace R-devel above with the place you keep R sources, you should  
not build directly in the source directory)

For 32-bit replace all x86_64 with i386 above. (You can build both and  
install in the same place, they'll co-exist nicely).

NOTE: You must specify -arch for all compilers, because the defaults  
now differ between Apple's Xcode 3.2 compilers and our gfortran.

---

IMPORTANT: If you upgraded from Leopard and/or you installed R for  
Leopard (Mac OS X 10.5) you may have a old gfortran from Xcode 3.1 on  
your machine - it will NOT work on SL properly. You MUST remove it and  
use the CRAN build of gfortran (or comparable) instead. To check for  
it run "which gfortran" in the Terminal - it should show either

This is ok, you have CRAN gfortran:
Fino:~$ which gfortran
/usr/local/bin/gfortran
Fino:~$

This is also ok for now, you have no gfortran, but you can install the  
one from CRAN:
Fino:~$ which gfortran
Fino:~$

This is bad:
  Fino:~$ which gfortran
/usr/bin/gfortran
Fino:~$

If you have /usr/bin/gfortran, remove it, e.g.
sudo rm /usr/bin/gfortran

---

I hope this helps, I'll also put it in the FAQ.

Cheers,
Simon

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] help building a package on mac
Message-ID: <4AA3A4FE.8040303@dbmail.com>

Hello,

I am developping an R aware version of apache ant, so that you can run R 
code within an ant build script. This will make the compilation of java 
source from one package that depends on java code from another package 
easier, etc ...

But I can not build it on the mac platform. Could someone from this list 
try to build it.

The package is source-controlled on r-forge :

$ svn checkout svn://svn.r-forge.r-project.org/svnroot/orchestra/pkg/ant
$ R CMD build ant
# R CMD INSTALL ant_0.0-3.tar.gz

The log file from r-forge shows partial success:
http://r-forge.r-project.org/R/?group_id=504&add_log=check_x86_32_mac&pkg=ant&flavor=patched&type=00install.out

I think the relevant part of the file is this :

** arch - ppc
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/bin/Rscript ../exec/ant.R 
--installer
Java for ppc cannot run in this configuration.
Please consult documentation.
Error in .jinit() : Cannot create Java virtual machine (-1)
Calls: .jinit -> .External
Execution halted
make: *** [mylibs] Error 1
ERROR: compilation failed for package 'ant'

and this is probably related to my Makevars file.

I don't have myself access to a mac and would appreciate feedback, so 
that I can release the package on CRAN.

Many thanks in advance,

Romain

If I see it correctly, you don't need native compilation for each  
architecture, because the resulting code should be platform- 
indemendent (Java-classes). Also you're not really building any  
dynamic library to load in R. If both are correct, you can for example  
use configure instead of src/Makevars to build your Java code since  
this a) guarantees that it is run only once b) doesn't trigger the  
SHLIB building so you do't need a fake .so.

Cheers,
Simon

Thanks. This is much better than the Makevars trick, too bad this cannot 
be a configure.R script that gets executed by Rscript as R is more 
likely installed than bash.

Am I right in assuming that the bash script can use ${R_HOME}

It doesn't have to be bash, but yes, it can use anything that is set  
by R CMD (including ${R_HOME}).
(Note that you'll also probably need configure.win - likely it'll have  
to be a bit different, but ${R_HOME} is accessible as well.)

Thanks. The script is pretty simple, so I guess it should work.

#!/bin/sh

cd inst/java_src
"${R_HOME}/bin/Rscript" ../../exec/ant.R --installer

Its all text that's not plotting. So no axis labels, no title, no  
nothing.
I think I somehow broke my fonts or at least R doesn't find them  
anymore.
However, I cannot see how and where because I have them available in  
other programs.

Message-ID: <7C44D8B9-E812-43EF-BB09-0C2613A9495E@globetrotter.net>

Hi,

I installed all that was available when I installed R 2.9.2, including  
tcltk. However, I got this message upon loading PBSmodelling.

I had a quick look at what Google found but it seems that I'd have to  
install this from source. Why would this particular part of tcltk need  
to be installed manually while the rest seems to be pre-installed  
(with the OS? by the R installer?).

Thanks in advance,

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Building package from source error "file is not of
	required architecture"
Message-ID: <e1fc21b0909101658q354dc913h813055156292b262@mail.gmail.com>

I'm running 10.6 from clean install, with the supplied Xcode, and R
2.9.2.  I am unable to build a package (specifically the phylobase
package [1]) which built fine under 10.5.8.  Even more confusingly it
seems to build fine for others using 10.6.   The end of the install
log (appended below) contains the these potentially informative
errors:

ld: warning: in ncl/ncl/.libs/libncl.a, file is not of required architecture
ld: warning: duplicate dylib /usr/local/lib/libgcc_s.1.dylib

The latter error I get with any source package, but doesn't seem to
prevent them from being installed.

The package also makes use of the Rcpp interface to use an included
library (NCL).  It is this included library that seems to not build
correctly, which could very well be related to the old version of
Rcpp, or the makefiles responsible for building it.

I've tried all manner of tweaking, upgrading, and list searching, but
the (probably obvious) solution still eludes me.  Any pointers in the
right direction are greatly appreciated.

Peter,

you have probably compiled ncl in 64-bit (default on SL) but you're  
using 32-bit R, so it won't work. Either use 64-bit R or compile ncl  
for 32-bit.

Cheers,
Simon

I suspected something obvious of the like. ?Unfortunately, I've not
been able to get 64 bit R working for me. ?When I try the following
for the CRAN version:

Birch$ R --arch x86_64
/usr/bin/R: line 207:
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/etc/x86_64/ldpaths: No such
file or directory

So I got the 2.9.2 patched version distributed as a tar.gz from
<http://r.research.att.com/> (thanks for providing this Simon!), but
that doesn't work with the 64bit GUI build on the same site (it won't
even launch, because it need 2.10.0).

So I installed the 32/64 Universal 2.9.0, but now building any package
gives errors [1] perhaps because SL doesn't install ppc64 libraries?
I the same (or similar warning) using the R-devel nightly.

I apologize if this to is obvious. ?When I install xcode, do I need to
install the tools for prior OSs to get ppc compilers?

Hello all,

Does someone know if there is a way Xcode highlights the R syntax?  
just like aquamacs does?

Thanks in advance

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Altering position of quartz window
Message-ID: <p0624080ec6cfe9b7c957@[192.168.11.3]>

There was some discussion a few months ago about how to alter the 
quartz defaults, and I remember that to change the size of the plot 
one has to hit return for the changes to stick.

However to change the default position of the plot window from bottom 
left, this trick does not work. Altering the position to say top 
right, then hitting return, produces a bleep after a second or two, 
and the new status is stored and remembered on restarting R, but it 
still plots bottom left.

Am I missing a trick here, or it is broken?

Thanks,
Tim

I am experiencing problems with JGR on Snow Leopard.
After looking for similar messaged I found that I should start
JGR from the command line.
Further down is the output.
I also rebuilt rJava from the source package and this did not help.
JGR gives me an error message:
Cannot find Java/R (JR) library (libjri.jnilib)
Please make sure you start by double clicking the JGR application.

Yes, CRAN R is 32-bit only.

Oh, true, the 2.9 GUI is simply not there. I'll have to look to see  
what went wrong.

[BTW: you can simply overwrite the installation with the 2.9.2 patched  
binary to upgrade it - the only part you really needed from the  
universal package was the GUI]

Yes, unfortunately. The hot fix is
rm -rf /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/bin/exec/ppc*

The compilers are there all right, it's the libraries that are  
missing. They are now only part of the 10.5 SDK in Xcode which is not  
used by R.

Cheers,
Simon

Apple only provides 64-bit Java in Snow Leopard, so you can only use  
64-bit R. In addition, you'll need 64-bit JGR launcher which you can  
download from
http://urbanek.info/JGR-1.6-SL.dmg
(despite the name it is compatible with both JGR 1.6 and 1.7 [I tested  
is with the latter])

(When installing packages from sources for 64-bir R, please make sure  
you use --arch x86_64 to build the 64-bit version).

Cheers,
Simon

Yes, this makes sense, but I was a bit confused by this comment on
r.research.att.com

"Leopard builds, 64-bit binaries and packages are becoming available
from CRAN as of R 2.8.0."
Does that mean r.research.att.com ?  I don't find a link on CRAN.

Okay, I was concerned there might be a version mismatch between 2.9.2
and the 2.9.0 gui so I didn't do that.  BTW is the repository for the
GUI public?  I see the .tar on CRAN.

Brilliant!  This works perfectly.  Thank you for not only contributing
software but patiently helping me understand it.

No, the package binaries are available directly from CRAN:
http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/leopard/contrib/

Hm.. the builds are in fact there on the build machine, but are  
missing from the website index ... some more digging needed ...

Please use the direct link in the meantime:

Patch-level releases of R are [supposed to be] binary-compatible, so  
it should be safe.


> BTW is the repository for the GUI public?

Yes, see FAQ:

2.4 How to build and install the R.app
The sources for the R.app GUI are currently not included in the global  
R source distribution. They are available in the form of a Xcode  
project on the R for Mac OS X CRAN pages (released versions) as well  
as the SVN repository. In order to check out the latest development  
version, use

svn co https://svn.r-project.org/R-packages/trunk/Mac-GUI

It seems I have been able to install 64bit R.


R version 2.9.2 Patched (2009-09-05 r49613)

[R.app GUI 1.28 (5399) x86_64-apple-darwin9.8.0]


I could not, however, find a newer installer version of R.app (or  
R64.app)

Trying to install JGR still does not work.
I downloaded 64bit JGR as I was told,
but on start it tells me it needs to install some additional  
libraries, and then tells ,e
that it could not finish its work.

the JGR packages is missing.
So I try
188-23-83-195:devel neuwirth$ sudo R --arch x86_64 CMD INSTALL JGR
* Installing to library ?/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/ 
library?
* Installing *source* package ?JGR? ...
** R
** inst
** preparing package for lazy loading
Error in library(CarbonEL) : there is no package called 'CarbonEL'
Error : package 'iplots' could not be loaded
ERROR: lazy loading failed for package ?JGR?
* Removing ?/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/library/JGR?
188-23-83-195:devel neuwirth$

How can I get past this problem?

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] JGR on Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard)
Message-ID: <CC4EE09D-BD7B-4E1D-9C89-B9715A504EA3@r-project.org>

To answer all those recent posts on both mailing lists regarding JGR  
on OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard):

You need 64-bit R to run JGR, because Apple has removed 32-bit Java  
from OS X 10.6. So follow those steps:

1) Install 64-bit R from http://r.research.att.com/
   option a) install R 2.9.0 package (but choose to NOT install  
gfortran)
   option b) unpack the leopard tar ball for R 2.9.2 and get the GUI  
from
   http://r.research.att.com/R-GUI-5473-2.9-leopard-Leopard64.dmg
   (in fact you can do both if you wish... ;))

2) install necessary packages as follows:
install.packages(c("rJava","JavaGD","iplots"))
install.packages("JGR",type="mac.binary")

3) download 64-bit JGR launcher from
http://urbanek.info/JGR-1.6-SL.dmg

Run the launcher and enjoy.

---

If you want to use JGR 1.7 from RForge.net, you have to install the  
packages from sources (when building JGR you must set NOAWT=1).
If you are using your own build of R, you must build everything from  
sources yourself.

Cheers,
Simon

Thanks for the hints.
It turns out that the part I originally missed was
> install.packages("JGR",type="mac.binary")

which I had never used before.
Now, getting more adventurous, I am trying to build the gmp package
in R64.

 > install.packages("gmp",type="mac.binary")
....

 > library(gmp)
Error: package 'gmp' is not installed for 'arch=x86_64'

So I am trying to build the package
I downloaded gmp from gmplig.org and it compiled and passed all the  
tests.
The output alsi indicated that it compiled a 64bit version.
Now for the R build:

Mini:devel neuwirth$ sudo R CMD INSTALL gmp_0.4-10.tar.gz
* Installing to library ?/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/ 
library?
* Installing *source* package ?gmp? ...

What am I doing wrong here. My guess is that I am still getting some  
switches wrong.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Using R together with S+/R mode of AlphaX/Tk
Message-ID: <4AAB94F4.20307@env.ethz.ch>

Dear Stefano,

I'd like to bring to your attention that AlphaX can be easily used with 
R these days again. However, the information offered at

    http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/RMacOSX-FAQ.html#External-editors

is quite outdated. Please fix the information offered there under point 
6.2 External editors as follows:

__________________________________
R accepts the Apple Event command open. This means than an external 
editor can communicate with R sending portions or entire scripts of R 
code to execute via files. This is the approach used by the S+/R mode in 
Alpha X (see 
http://alphatcl.sourceforge.net/wiki/pmwiki.php/Software/AlphaX). This 
mode is quite powerful and supports in a convenient manner the writing 
and execution of R scripts from within AlphaX. Moreover, the mode is 
written in Tcl, can therefore be easily extended.

Which AlphaX to use? It is recommended to use the latest beta 
development release of AlphaX, since it contains a well working S+/R 
mode. However, if you prefer to use one of the stable releases of AlphaX 
(version 8.0.2), you need first to install a small fix for the S+/R mode 
to interact properly with the current generation of the R software. The 
fix is available at
http://www.sysecol.ethz.ch/SimSoftware/SimSoftware2.html#S+R_Mode and 
hints on its use and installation are available at
http://alphatcl.sourceforge.net/wiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaXTkAndRInOSX.

You can use type="mac.binary" only for packages that have no native  
library inside (gmp does).

Here is is another one.
I am trying to compile rscproxy for R64.
So I downloaded the sources, and I tried
sudo R --arch=x86_64 CMD INSTALL rscproxy_1.3-1.tar.gz

I get things like
gcc-4.2 -arch i386 -std=gnu99 -I/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/ 
Resources/include -I/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/include/ 
i386 -I../inst/include -I/usr/local/include    -fPIC  -g -O2 -c  
bdx_SEXP.c -o bdx_SEXP.o

and

** arch - ppc
gcc-4.2 -arch ppc -std=gnu99 -I/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/ 
Resources/include -I/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/include/ 
ppc -I../inst/include -I/usr/local/include    -fPIC  -g -O2 -c  
bdx_SEXP.c -o bdx_SEXP.o

but nothing about x86_64

What am I doing wrong this time?

For packages that don't have configure or Makefile regular R CMD  
INSTALL will build all architectures so you don't need --arch.  
However, if you see i386 and ppc but don't see x86_64 then it looks as  
if you have 32-bit R from CRAN ... (yet if --arch x86_64 works it  
should be the 64-bit R - so I'm a bit confused). Are you sure you are  
using the correct R version? You should see:

Fino:~$ ls /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/bin/exec
i386   ppc    ppc64  x86_64

In fact on Snow Leopard you want to run
rm -rf /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/bin/exec/ppc*
because Rosetta is not installed by default and ppc64 libraries are  
missing, so on SL you should see

Fino:~$ ls /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/bin/exec
i386   x86_64

Cheers,
Simon

Hi Simon,

I'm sorry to say that I've tried and failed to set up 64-bit R 2.9.2  
and JGR.

(1) It's not clear to me where on http://r.research.att.com/ to  
download from. (I searched for "snow", since all else assumed that I  
know what I'm doing.)

(2) I don't understand why you say (below) to download 2.9.0 rather  
than 2.9.2.

So could you please give step by step fool-proof instructions? (Right  
now, after fiddling, I can't launch R or JGR.)

Thanks,
Michael

Look at this section:

Universal nightly builds for Mac OS X (10.4 Tiger and 10.5 Leopard)

For R-2.9.2, you want to look at the third row of that table:

R-2.9-branch
R 2.9.2 Patched (2009-09-05)

http://r.research.att.com/R-2.9-branch-leopard-universal.tar.gz

Note that this is NOT an installer, you have to untar the file and  
have it "inflate" at the root of your file system. The way to do that  
is explained immediately after that download/table listing:

"""Alternatively you can use the tar-ball (*.tar.gz) which must be  
unpacked in the root (e.g. tar fvxz R*.tar.gz -C /), but doesn't  
contain the GUI (see below for a separate download)."""

> (2) I don't understand why you say (below) to download 2.9.0 rather

I don't know why he mentioned that, but if this is the case, look at  
the "Leopard Build" section, there is a *.pkg installer for 2.9.0

http://r.research.att.com/R-2.9.0.pkg

Downloading and installing one of the two R versions above will at  
least get R back up and running on your system (from the terminal, at  
least -- perhaps the *.pkg has the R.app gui installed too, I'm not  
certain).

If R is completely hosed, you might want to start by removing all  
current installs (/Library/Frameworks/R.framework) you have now to  
ensure everything is fresh and clean (but maybe not, up to you.).

On the above webpage it says:

"Leopard build" (available in 32-bit and 64-bit) and the Download is  
R-2.9.0.pkg. That is the installer for all-archs (32+64 bit) R 2.9.0 -  
and this is the option a) I was talking about and it's the option that  
doesn't assume you know what you're doing - it's simply the package  
installer as on CRAN.

Higher up it says "R-2.9-branch-leopard-universal.tar.gz" and in the  
table you can infer that it's R 2.9.2 patched (nightly build). This is  
the option b) which assumes you know how to unpack a tar ball manually:
sudo tar fxz R-2.9-branch-leopard-universal.tar.gz -C /

The reason I said take 2.9.0 was because it's the fool proof method.  
[I don't have an installer for 64-bit R 2.9.2 yet because it's not  
automated due to changes in the PM].

Please follow the instructions in the e-mail below - I was hoping   
they are fool proof :). Do you have any suggestions to make the R for  
Mac webpage more obvious?

Cheers,
Simon

latin9 is not a supported alias on OS X, you may want to use the full  
name of the encoding, i.e., reencode="ISO-8859-15" (if it is really  
latin9).

[It probably needs to be fixed either in foreign (because it should  
know better than to not use latin9) or in R (if we want to support the  
latin9) ...]

The problem may arise for  *NIX-newbies ( a group in which I still  
claim membership)  that they are unable to operationalize that  
message. For one thing they may not even know how to open a Terminal  
window. For another they may not know that the "/" at the end of that  
command will take care of "unpacking at the root", so they will not  
need to navigate away from the place that they find themselves when  
Terminal opens up a bash session.  The steps broken down would be  
something along these lines:

First : Download the nightly build, and select "Save to file" rather  
than opening with Stuffit, and then it by default should end up in the  
<user>/Downloads/ folder.

1. a-c) Go to the Utilities folder of the Applications folder and  
double-click on Terminal.app
2. a) Go back to the browser and select the string:  tar fvxz  
R*.tar.gz -C /

(I would solicit some input here from more competent UNIXers regarding  
whether one would ever need to prefix this command with sudo.)

2. b) cmd-C to put it in the clipboard
2. c) click on the Terminal window and cmd-V to paste-in that command.
2 d) use the arrow and backspace keys (since mouse-clicking does not  
change the cursor position in Terminal sessions) to delete the  
"R*.tar.gz" on the command line.

3 a) Navigate with the Finder to the Downloads/ folder and locate the  
R<build>. Click-drag that file to the Terminal window and  
"unclick" (or is it lift-click) when the pointer is at the place on  
the command line where the "R*.tar.gz" used to be. A full path version  
of the file name will get inserted (an no quotes are needed, unlike  
what one might expect after working in R regularly.)

On my machine, one now sees this on the command line:
tar fvxz /Users/davidwinsemius/Downloads/R-2.9-branch-leopard- 
universal.tar.gz  -C /

4) Hit <return>

Sit back and watch the show.

You can the separately download the appropriate R-GUI and put in in  
the /Applications/ folder.

It does, In fact, it has both the 32 bit GUI and the 64 bit GUI. What  
I did was install that package _first_ which gave me 2.9.0 and then  
performed the steps above. You really would not want to do it in a  
reversed order, since you would be replacing R 2.9.2 with R 2.9.0.

And of course this message _should_ have gone to r-sig-mac at stat.math.ethz.ch 
  and any follow up should trim the r-help address.

I too would vote for a 1 2 3 set of install instructions, maybe for 32bit
and 64bit if they differ

I did the 123 below and

1-the were many messages during install like " x
Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.9/Resources/share/texmf/: Can't
update time for 
Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.9/Resources/share/texmf: Operation
not permitted, but

2-2.9.2 seems to function OK after simple testing; is that warning
insignificant

3-R.app available at http://r.research.att.com/ is 5426 but 5455 32 and 64
bit available at 
http://r.research.att.com/R-GUI-5455-2.9-leopard-Leopard.dmg as per 8/6/09
r-sig-mac discussion so I put in 5455; but why 5426 here and 5455 there?

Thank you

Hi,

David's post should have all-but-nailed it ... some comments in line:

They don't. The R that you install following the instructions below is  
a universal build, so 32bit and 64 bit (ppc + intel) are all installed.

R is then launched in 32 bit or 64 bit mode by the command line args  
sent to it on launch. The various GUI's (if you go that route) take  
care of this for you. The 64 bit gui are the ones w/ 64 at the end of  
their download link, eg:

* http://r.research.att.com/R-GUI-5426-2.1-leopard-Leopard.dmg (32  
bit); vs
* http://r.research.att.com/R-GUI-5426-2.1-leopard-Leopard64.dmg (64  
bit)

If you launch R from the terminal, it defaults to 32bit.

If you want to launch R form the terminal in 64bit, you would do:

For intel:
$ R --arch x86_64

For ppc:
$ R --arch ppc64

Long version:

This is because you need to run the "tar" command as a user who has  
privileges to write to the directory that the files are being  
uncompressed to.

Short version:

2c of David's commands should be:

2. c) click on the Terminal window and
   (i) Type (without quotes): "sudo "
   (ii) Paste in the tar command: cmd-V to paste-in that command.

So, the command to execute at 2c in your terminal is:

$ sudo tar fvxz R*.tar.gz -C /

I would do this again to ensure you have all of the 2.9.2 "parts" in  
there (ie, don't assume that everything was OK when you did it and got  
all those "permission denied" warnings/errors).

I don't have an answer for that, 5455 is a later build of the .app, so  
if it's working for you, I guess just go ahead and keep using that  
one. Otherwise, fall back to the one on the site.

Hope that helps some,

If you install Urbanek's, you get both, no choice. If you install  
CRAN's, R you get only 32 bit.

When run from the command line, the default is 32 bit. With  
(Urbanek's)  R --arch=x86_64 , you get 64 bit R running. Or you can  
use the 32 bit or 64 bit GUI's, just not both at the same time.  
Obviously the 64 bit GUI will _not_ make the CRAN R into a 64 bit  
version.

I think this means ... success.

I have learned to ignore the ...." chmod failed ... operation not  
permitted" warnings. Happens all the time when building packages from  
source and seems to have no ill consequences. Not sure about the  
"Can't update time errors".

Can't help you there. I have the 2.9.0 GUI [R.app GUI 1.29 (5463)  
x86_64-apple-darwin9.7.0] running with the R 2.9.1 Patched and am not  
having noticeable difficulties. My guess is that the "right" way to do  
this would be to use 5426 with R 2.9.2

Note to web page maintainer. The labels on the R-GUI's must be wrong,  
they say "R 2.1.x". Is that supposed to say R 2.9.x and 2.10.x?

And my guess appears to be wrong. I installed the current R-2.9-branch- 
leopard-universal.tar.gz using Lianglou's confrmation of my suggestion  
that sudo might need to prefix the ta command. Also downloaded the Mac  
OS X GUI rev. 5426 for R 2.1.xleopard-Leopard64.dmg file and dragged  
the R.app file to another loaction, renamed it R64new,app, and dragged  
it to the Applications folder. That GUI crashes while the old one

To add:

If I try to install using the mac.binary, it tells me (on opening the
64 bit app) that the package is not installed for x64. And does not
let me load the library when using 64 bit mode. However, if I install
the package from source, then it installs for x64, but gives me weird
results.

Again: would appreciate if some one could confirm so that I can
contact the authors and let them know. I do need Halton normals for
some thing I am working on, and I am sitting right on that borderline
point where the memory constraints of the 32 bit app are making me
lose sleep ...

Best,
A

I wouldn't know what to look for to tell you if it's going wrong or not.

I have no idea about anything related to financial modeling and don't
have the fOptions package installed anyway.

Perhaps if you post the two images you get:
i. what you expect to see/what you get from 32bit
ii. the wrong image that you're getting from the 64bit version

One of us can confirm/deny that we get the same thing.

Otherwise, I really can't give you an educated answer w/o having to
looking into what this 'halton' stuff is anyway ...

So .. help us help you :-)

I'm not sitting at a 64 bit machine atm, so hopefully someone else can
help you before I get back to school tomorrow ...

I've never installed JGR, so I'm not sure what's going on and that
message isn't really telling me much.

Is there any other messages (above or below) that can help diagnose this?

Perhaps it's something trivial w/ R+JGR, but I'm just not familiar with it.

No, I never said that :). I had posted the correct link here before:
http://r.research.att.com/R-GUI-5473-2.9-leopard-Leopard64.dmg

Please DO note the 2.9 in the name! Clearly taking the R-devel version  
of the GUI with R 2.9.2 is not supposed to work ...

2.1.x is supposed to say 2.10.x (hence R-devel, really) - it's just a  
glitch in the script that generates the names on build which assume  
one-character versions. I was hoping that common sense would be  
applied here since the builds are R-2.9-patched and R-devel it should  
be obvious that one is 2.9.x and the other 2.10.x ...

Cheers,
Simon

PS: Sometime this week I hope to get some spare time to create the SL- 
safe R 2.9.2 package installer to save the suffering early  
adopters ;). The real blame should go to Apple for screwing up Java so  
badly, though ... ;)

Sorry, but of course.

rnorm.halton should be "almost" identical to rnorm (rnorm gives draws
from a 0 mean, 1sd Normal). Halton sequences (amongst other things)
allow one to draw from the normal in a "more intelligent" fashion when
integrating. Using hist, you should see the classic "bell curve"
centered around 0. Almost identical to

hist(rnorm(1000), plot=TRUE)

The 32 bit "version" gives the bell curve. My 64 bit version gives a
totally different plot (nothing subtle) ... some times with only
positive values for all 100 draws. My 64 bit version of rnorm.halton
also often outputs a bunch of NaNs. If both your plots look like a
bell curve, the problem is on my machine/end.

Thanks very much: do greatly appreciate it.

Best,
Anirban

So tonight I used 123 to install 2.9.2 32 and 64 on a MacPro
The 123 plan worked (including R.app's 5455) after simple testing

I think 123 might go on the <http://r.research.att.com/> page
Or some other upfront page

Cool, let us hope this 123 lasts for a time, I must store it

I sudo tar'd it and the warnings went away

Will go on with 5455s as the 5426s fail on this Snow Leopard

Did you install XCode after upgrading to Snow Leopard? It looks like
it can't find the "make" tool.

...

> Error: package 'lme4' is not installed for 'arch=x86_64'

Being that you just installed 64 bit version of R, this makes sense.

Just install the new XCode and install a source package:

R> install.packages('lme4', type='source')

It should work out fine.

I get very different output from the two versions of Mac OSX R as  
well. The 32 bit version puts out a histogram that has an expected,  
almost symmetric unimodal distribution. The 64 bit version created a  
bimodal distribution with one large mode near 0 and another smaller  
mode near 10E+37. Postcript output attached.

Neither version seemed to change with repeated invocations which I  
thought odd in what I thought would be  graphic realization of random  
function, but then I don't know much about this area of statistics, so  
I don't know is the output is supposed to appear deterministic.

Running the suggested replacement causes an error on both 32 bit and  
64 bit machines:
 > hist(halton(n = 5000, dim = 1, norm=TRUE), main = "Normal Halton",
+ xlab = "x", col = "steelblue3", border = "white")
Error in hist(halton(n = 5000, dim = 1, norm = TRUE), main = "Normal  
Halton",  :
   could not find function "halton"

That is not my experience, although it was true in the past. Most of  
the CRAN binaries now work fine under 64 bit. I do not have Snow  
Leopard so this experience is only from MacOSX 10.5.8.

lme4 (x86_64) compiled fine on Snow Leopard for me. I have the xcode
that came with my Snow Leopard installation kit.

Thanks everyone for your replies. Particularly David.

The numbers are pseudo-random. Repeated calls should/would give the
same output. Currently, Halton works fine when used to just get the
Halton sequence, but the random deviates call is not working in 64 bit
R. For now, I will generate the numbers in 32 bit R, save them and
then load them back in when using 64 bit R. The package maintainers
can look at it if/when they get a chance and/or access to 64 bit R.

Thanks!

Best,
Anirban

As I said, this package is not one with which I have experience. It  
has _not_ however the case that repeated calls to (typical?) random  
number functions give the same output when called repeatedly:

I cannot imagine a situation where one would _want_ the output to be  
the same on repeated calls unless one reset a seed. Unless perhaps I  
am not understanding the meaning of "random" in the financial domain?

It does not help the problem, but Halton numbers belong to the family  
of quasi random sequence. Yes generally two calls to quasi RNG produce  
the same sequence. They are intended to be well equidistributed but  
not random.

By the way, two to pseudo RNGs produce differents sequences because  
the algo uses the machine time to initiate the seed. Both quasi and  
pseudo RNG are deterministic algo. With Petr Savicky, we make a  
vignette on this topic for randtoolbox.

Sorry, what I should have said was Halton numbers are quasi-random,
and not pseudo-random. Quasi-random is the technically appropriate
terminology.

Halton sequences are low discrepancy: the subsequence looks/smells
random. Hence, they are often used in quasi monte carlo simulations.
To be precise, there is only 1 Halton sequence for a particular prime.
Repeated calls to Halton should return the same numbers. The first
column is the Halton sequence for 2. the second for 3, the third for 5
and so on using the first M primes (for M columns). (You can also
scramble the sequence to avoid this.)

I am using them to integrate over a multivariate normal space. If you
take 1000 random draws, then sum f() over the draws is the expectation
of f(). If f() is very non-linear (and/or multi-variate) then even
with large N, its often hard to get a good integral. With quasi-random
draws, the integration is better for the same N. (One uses the inverse
distribution function.) For an example, you can look at Train's paper
(page 4 and 5 have a good explanation) at:

http://elsa.berkeley.edu/wp/train0899.pdf

In the context of simulated maximum likelihood estimation, such
integrals are very common. Of course true randomness has its own
place/importance: its just that quasi-random numbers can be very
useful in certain contexts.

Regards,
Anirban

PS: qnorm(halton()) gets around the problem of the random deviates not working.

will get snow Leopard in the coming days and will try to reproduce  
your problem. Did you compile R 64 yourself?

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] R 2.9.2 release package for Leopard and Snow Leopard
Message-ID: <FA7DA814-5EFE-413F-A5AC-125D491A58DF@r-project.org>

R 2.9.2 release installer package for Leopard and Snow Leopard (64-bit  
and 32-bit build) is now available at

http://r.research.att.com/

The full file link is
http://r.research.att.com/R-2.9.2.pkg

MD5: b8468651f3d894bfda5e0b46e5fed1e4

On Mac OS X 10.6 it makes 64-bit the default on the command line and  
provides R32 and R64 start scripts to force one or the other. It also  
removes ppc* support (you cannot compile ppc packages on Snow Leopard,  
you must use Leopard if you want to target ppc/ppc64).

On Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard) it makes 32-bit the default (as usual) but  
provides R64 on the command line.

Both GUIs (R64 and R) and provided in either case. The package does  
not contain Tcl/Tk nor gfortran, use
http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools/
if you want to use Tcl/Tk or compile packages from sources (if you  
installed full CRAN R previously then you already have all that).

It is considered a RC for CRAN.

Cheers,
Simon

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] RODBC connection MS SQL with Actual driver
Message-ID: <A10DEBCD-462C-48F1-A5DE-F1CCC0A91DDC@noaa.gov>

Hello

I am trying to troubleshoot connection issues from RODBC on a mac  
(leopard) to a Microsoft SQL Server using the Actual SQL Server driver.

I have the driver installed and the System DSN is setup and tests  
successfully. I have also successfully connected and downloaded data  
in Excel and via terminal using iodbctest. I can also successfully  
connect to this SQL server from a windows box and using RODBC on a  
windows installation of R.

That said, on the mac, odbcConnect() and odbcDriverConnect() both  
result in a segfault.

I have some theories about what might be happening:

1) there is a conflict between RODBC and the Actual SQL Server driver  
that is causing the crash

2) the domain\user specification is not possible with RODBC and I  
should use a separate SQL Server user authentication

I am continuing to pursue these possibilities on my own and with our  
local IT staff, but thought I would reach out to the r/mac community  
to get further advice or suggestions. If I find an answer, I'll post  
as a response for the archives.

Thanks for any assistance in advance
josh

*******
Below are example details and code

System DSN = my_database
Driver = Actual SQL Server

username = mydomain\me
password = p@$$

 >library(RODBC)
 >odbcConnect("my_database",uid="mydomain\\me",pwd="p@$$")

  *** caught segfault ***

Traceback:

By far the most likely cause is a bug in the ODBC driver.  But can you 
not run this in a debugger and find out where the code is segfaulting: 
if in the driver that pinpoints the cause (and if in RODBC it could 
still be the driver returning incorrect structures).

I have some of the Actual Technologies' ODBC drivers but not this one. 
They have rather a lot of incompletely/incorrectly implemented 
features (there are some notes in the RODBC manual) and are prone to 
crashing.

Thanks a lot Simon!

If I only want to work in 64bit, do you foresee any problems if I also  
remove the i386* support? I've been doing that for a while and it  
seems to cause no problems (I usually refresh (curl) R from your site  
in the morning and in that script I added the ppc* and i386* removal  
lines after the curl).

Regards,
Rob

Sure, as long as you don't try to use the 32-bit you're free to delete  
it (on Snow Leopard). The libR and friends are "fat" so universal apps  
will still able to compile (even if they won't run).
In general, I was contemplating deleting the other arch's libs as well  
in the script, but I figured it's not worth the hassle, because the  
space used by libs is miniscule compared to data etc.

Cheers,
Simon

a) Obviously OpenMP is more portable. Even on a Mac I had to use  
Apple's gcc in this case
    (I normally use the GNU gcc-trunk).

b) GCD does not require specifying the number of threads -- it  
determines it at runtime.

c) Coding is simpler.

d) Since GCD is at a lower OS level than OpenMP, it will probably  
handle resource allocation
    better. But my small example, on an otherwise idle Mac Pro (16  
cores, 32 GB of RAM), does
    not really highlight that.

e) For more info, and some OpenMP comparisons, see

    http://www.macresearch.org/cocoa-scientists-xxxi-all-aboard-grand-central
    http://arstechnica.com/apple/reviews/2009/08/mac-os-x-10-6.ars/12

To quote Syracuse

"Write your application as usual, but if there's any part of its  
operation that can
reasonably be expected to take more than a few seconds to complete,  
then for the love of Zarzycki,
get it off the main thread!"

Jan,

thanks for sharing this. This is really interesting. We have been  
contemplating using GCD for R (mainly pnmath) but at the time OMP was  
faster. However, GCD got apparently really good in the meantime:

 > system.time(threads(100000,1000,"omp_try"))
    user  system elapsed
   9.671   0.009   2.441
 > system.time(threads(100000,1000,"gcd_try"))
    user  system elapsed
   9.592   0.004   2.410
 > system.time(threads(100000,1000,"dcg_try"))
    user  system elapsed
   9.784   0.003   9.788

[This is on Harpertown 2.66GHz quad core]

So GCD is surprisingly just a hair faster than OMP (also surprising to  
me is that using more threads than cores make OMP faster - the above  
is with 16 threads).

I would not say - OMP takes just one #pragma - no need to change your  
code whereas GCD requires several special function calls... However,  
OMP is more limited in the kind of things you can do.

Cheers,
Simon

Actually, with schedule(dynamic) the gap is almost at the level of the  
measurement error:

 > system.time(threads(100000,1000,"omp_try"))
    user  system elapsed
   9.614   0.006   2.420
 > system.time(threads(100000,1000,"gcd_try"))
    user  system elapsed
   9.586   0.005   2.409

-- the OMP line (to be placed before the for() loop) is 
#pragma omp parallel for default(shared) private(i) schedule(dynamic)

Simon

on my system (2 x 2.93 quad core Nehalem
with hyper-threading, so 16 threads max, 16GB RAM,
10.6.1, 64bit kernel, 64bit R)

 > system.time(threads(100000,1000,"omp"))
    user  system elapsed
  10.249   0.009   0.662
 > system.time(threads(100000,1000,"gcd"))

 > system.time(threads(100000,1000,"dcg"))
    user  system elapsed
   8.731   0.005   8.738

so omp == gcd, but for more complicated tasks the
tighter integration may favor gcd

comparing harpertown and nehalem --> surprising
difference (kernel ? hyper-threading ?)

i have no idea how the open-sourced gcd works on
non-mac hardware

code is downloadable using webdav from
public.me.com/jdeleeuw/software/threads
or using afp://gifi.stat.ucla.edu from
the deleeuw public directory

Interesting but consistent with my observations so far - Nehalems are  
not any faster than equally clocked Harpertowns (see dcg time). The  
only gains are in HT as seen in your example - my Harpertown has 4  
logical cpus, yours has 16. My 2.26GHz Nehalem is running Leopard  
(because it's the build machine ;)) but the results are similar:

 > system.time(threads(100000,1000,"omp_try"))
    user  system elapsed
  12.924   0.031   0.852
 > system.time(threads(100000,1000,"dcg_try"))
    user  system elapsed
  11.595   0.009  11.608

Again, the sequential time is about the same as on equally clocked  
Harpertown, but the HT helps with a factor of over 13. That explains  
where the alleged performance boost on Nehalems comes from ...

It would be interesting to run OMP pnmath with schedule(dynamic) on a  
8-core Nehalem and compare that with a stock R ... (pnmath will need a  
bit of tweaking because it attempts to be too smart on the number of  
threads). Clearly, on many short operations it may cause a hit, but  
the gain on long vectors is up to 16 which is impressive ...

Cheers,
Simon

Having recently installed the the binary OS X R.framework package I
have 2 suggestions:

1. Symlinks are created for both ../Resources/man1/R.1 and Rscript.1
in the /usr/local/man/man1 directory.
2. The 2 symlinks R and Rscript which are created in /usr/bin rather
be created in /usr/local/bin if the directory exists.

Thanks

R-devel with recommended packages compiles (at breakneck speed)
with the new clang front-end that comes with XCode 3.2 in
SnowLeopard.

Executables run at the same speed as those made with Apple's gcc-4.2
and GNU's gcc-4.5 (they are binary compatible) but in clang the C++
support is minimal and OpenMP is missing (of course GCD is available).

It also compiles with the new llvm-gcc, which does support
C++ and OpenMP.

I get a segmentation error with -O4, which turns on link-time
optimization.

/usr/local/bin is by default *not* on PATH so for all regular Mac  
users both of the above is useless. If you are managing your own /usr/ 
local then there is nothing preventing you from creating the synlinks  
to /usr/bin (not that I understand why you would want that but that's  
another story ...). However, from your comment I gather it may be  
worthwhile to symlink the man pages to /usr/share/man ...

I think that's something you'd have to do yourself. It involves  
creating two files, e.g.

R.xclangspec
R.pbfilespec

that include the keywords and directions to Xcode. I don't know the  
details of the internals of these files, but you can Google the terms  
"xclangspec" and "pbfilespec". I'm attaching two files that you can  
use as a starting point (I copied the python files to use as a  
template). I haven't been able to get them to work though. Finally,  
you'll need to install them in:

~/Library/Application Support/Apple/Developer Tools/Specifications

I think. :)

Let us know if you can get it to work.

Cheers,
Demitri

Thats not where I find such files on my system. All the .xclangspec  
files are in one directory
~me$ find /Developer -name \*.xclangspec
/Developer/Library/PrivateFrameworks/XcodeEdit.framework/Versions/A/ 
Resources/Ada.xclangspec
/Developer/Library/PrivateFrameworks/XcodeEdit.framework/Versions/A/ 
Resources/BaseSupport.xclangspec
/Developer/Library/PrivateFrameworks/XcodeEdit.framework/Versions/A/ 
Resources/C++.xclangspec
Snipped remaining 20 or so versions

Some of the .pbfilespec files are there althought there a acouple of  
other spots as well:

~me$ find /Developer -name \*.pbfilespec
/Developer/Applications/Dashcode.app/Contents/Frameworks/ 
CYKit.framework/Versions/A/Resources/Cayenne.pbfilespec
/Developer/Library/PrivateFrameworks/DevToolsCore.framework/Versions/A/ 
Resources/Built-in file types.pbfilespec
/Developer/Library/PrivateFrameworks/DevToolsCore.framework/Versions/A/ 
Resources/Standard file types.pbfilespec
/Developer/Library/Xcode/Plug-ins/IBCompilerPlugin.xcplugin/Contents/

/Developer/Library/Xcode/Plug-ins/XdesignCompilerPlugin.xcplugin/ 
Contents/Resources/Xdesign file types.pbfilespec

When I drag those two files to that directory, Xcode does some  
highlighting but only of non-reserved words and comments, and also  
does "(" and "{" matching if you move the cursor forward over a ")" or  
"}", but not if the cursor is moved backwards.)  Also shows some code  
completion. I'm not sure what was _supposed_ to happen, but I do see  
some behavior that suggests _some_ of those efforts were having a  
desired effect.

You have to set
PATH=/Library/Frameworks/GTK+.framework/Resources/bin:$PATH
if you want to compile GTK+ packages from sources (although that  
should not be necessary because BioC provides binaries ...). Also the  
choice of compilers can be tricky with GTK+...

I'd strongly recommend not touching (or adding to) those. Note the  
"Private" there. :) Those are the languages built into Xcode. Apple  
does provide a way to add your own without modifying the system. I'm  
not 100% sure the path I gave is right as I've seen different ones, e.g.

http://kbase.wincent.com/old/knowledge-base/Xcode_Text_Macros.html   
<-- useful
http://code.google.com/p/cocoa-sharp-dev/wiki/XcodeAdditions

Ah, I just moved the files to this path and they registered with Xcode  
- it seems to have changed between 2.x and 3.x:

~/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Specifications

That one is correct. Put the files in there, and in an Xcode project,  
open an R file, do a "get info", and change the "File Type" to  
sourcecode.R.

So, it wasn't working in that path I gave first. What you were  
probably seeing was Xcode interpreting the file as a rez (resource)  
file, not R. But try the path above. Since they share the same  
extension, you'll have to select it manually (as above).

Finally, I don't know the details of the internals of those files. I  
made a quick five minute hack at it, adding the keyword list, calling  
it "R", but not much more. It's *definitely* buggy and will need work,  
but should give someone a push in the right direction. Google will help.

Cheers,
Demitri

There is no binary Ruuid that shows up in the BioConductor repository  
with the 64bit GUI Package Installer, although there is a version that  
is downloadable with the 32 bit version.

$ PATH=/Library/Frameworks/GTK+.framework/Resources/bin:$PATH
$ echo $PATH

/Library/Frameworks/GTK+.framework/Resources/dev/bin:/sw/bin:/sw/sbin:/ 
usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/texbin:/usr/X11/bin:/ 
usr/X11R6/bin

(There is no /bin folder in the /Resources/ sub-directory when I look  
with Finder.app. Should it have been /Library/Frameworks/GTK 
+.framework/Resources/dev/bin ? Nope. Tried changing first entry in  
PATH to that and no joy.)

So am still getting same error:
(I am wondering if there is a better way to test the Gtk+ installation  
that compiling a bioc pkg?)

Well, yes, we don't provide 64-bit version of GTK+ (the build is for  
Tiger which doesn't have sufficient 64-bit libraries), so that's why  
there is no 64-bit version of packages that require GTK+.

.. then you have some other GTK+ framework (maybe the old runtime?).  
The current one is at
http://r.research.att.com/gtk2-framework.dmg
but, again, that one is not 64-bit. If it is of interest I could look  
into updating it, but it's usually a quite demanding endeavor so  
probably not before next week.

Simon

What is the best way to update my installation of Gtk+? I ran the  
package installer in that .dmg file today  before posting these  
questions (as I have before several times). Do I rip out the whole  
framework and start again?

Message-ID: <f49fcd830909190034rbec3d7hdfbc32f48e31b530@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have few questions regarding R 2.9.2 + Aquamacs + ESS. I'm moving
from WinXP to Mac (Snow Leopard 10.6.1) and also from Tinn-R to
Aquamacs (1.8c).

1. Is there syntax highlighting in Aqaumacs? Now when I open .R file
only the lines starting with comment mark (#), quoted words etc. are
shown in color. What about R:s reserved words? In Tinn-R these words
where shown blue. Is there this kind of functionality in Aquamacs?

2. When I evaluate an area of R code (send it to R), I press C-c C-r.
If the area is e.g. 50 lines, I would like that the cursor in the ESS
windows goes into an end (like pressing C-c M-r) and I don't have to
jump back into the code window. How can I achieve this?

3. It seems to bit complicated to keep pressing C-c all the time, is
there a way to make a shortcut key (e.g when pressing Alt-S an area of
code is sent to ESS-window (into R)

4. Is there a way to split code window and ESS-window (R) vertically
(side to side)? The default split is horizontally.

Thanks!

-Johannes

Dear Johannes,

When you come from XP and used R with Tinn-R Why don't you try The  
standard R-Gui that comes with the R binaries. I find it very  
intuitive and easy to use. Syntax coloring is complete, send line,  
send selection, and send all is easy with just one short key (you can  
set it as you wish in the preferences).

Just give it a try.
Best regards
Gerald

On Macs (and possibly other *NIXen) the equivalent to reading from the  
"clipboard" is: pipe("pbpaste")

Testing shows that a simple modification after defining  
CleanTranscript produces no error on the example above:

 > source(textConnection(CleanTranscript(readLines(pipe("pbpaste")))),

Thanks for the response. One reason is that I would like to learn
Aquaemacs 'cause

1. I can use it when I code with perl, python etc.
2. I can use it (emacs) also in windows when I have to work with Windows
3. Everyone is talking about how good emacs is; it would be nice to
see if that is true :-)

Yes and no. Aquamacs has a number of keybindings that have been made  
to conform to the Mac standard, so Emacs on a different platform might  
work differently. Mind you, on my linux machines I prefer Xemacs  
because it has more menues than emacs, so I do bypass part of the  
probel of different keybidings. Having said that, using the 'sane'  
keybindings of aquamacs is such a joy I'd never go back.

I suspect that you will want to investigate one or another of the  
access methods (and perhaps subscribe)  to the ESS mailing list:

http://www.nabble.com/ESS---Help-f28748.html

There is a search facility on that page and there may be other such  
web sites. I am not a current user but think I may join you in trying  
out Aquamacs-ESS. My current puzzle is to figure out the code sending  
and receiving to/from R. The instructions suggest to me that I will  
need to leave behind the R-GUI which I rather regret. I think the  
Package Manager and Installer are nicely engineered.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] compiling packages for 64 bit architecture
Message-ID: <1C18D92C-07E1-4054-8379-6DFE2211E455@gmail.com>

Hi all,

Using the following command to compile a package for 64bit  
architecture, I get a strange warning

randtoolbox

Everything is compiled correctly. In R64 GUI, the package is loaded  
successfully.

How could I get rid of this warning?

Furthermore, if I launch R GUI, the package could not better loaded  
any more on 32 bit architecture... I got
Error: package 'randtoolbox' is not installed for 'arch=i386'

How could I use both architecture at the same time (from different  
GUIs). I need to compare outputs of the halton function between the  
two architectures.

Thanks in advance

Christophe

The correct command is
R --arch x86_64 CMD INSTALL ...
(note that --arch is an argument of R *not* of INSTALL).

Yes, you replaced it.

You have to use --libs-only (see R-admin: 2.5 Sub-architectures).
First, do *not* use the directory of the package unless you cleaned it  
(important!!). Then you want something like
R --arch=i386 CMD INSTALL --libs-only randtoolbox

Simon

Thanks , I'll have a look at the subsection 2.5

-31 doesn't pass make check hence it's not available.

Install the current R 2.9.2 binary from

Thanks for the tips, it works now.

Since randtoolbox depends on rngWELL, which also has a configure file,  
I need to the following to compile randtoolbox for both architectures:
- for i386,
	- rm *.o  in rngWELL/src
	- R --arch=i386 CMD INSTALL --libs-only rngWELL
	- rm *.o  in randtoolbox/src
	- R --arch=i386 CMD INSTALL --libs-only randtoolbox
- for x86_64,
	- rm *.o  in rngWELL/src
	- R --arch=x86_64 CMD INSTALL --libs-only rngWELL
	- rm *.o  in randtoolbox/src
	- R --arch= x86_64 CMD INSTALL --libs-only randtoolbox

If I want to avoid to manually remove object files in src directory,  
can I use a makefile in this directory?

Do you advise me to install packages in a different directory than  
R_HOME/library using -l option?

Thanks in advance

Christophe

Sure, why not? If it's not there, you can make one yourself, no? We  
can provide an example, if that's what you're after.

I'm not sure how to get R to run a custom Makefile tho (R-gurus: can  
you?)

I think this is a matter of personal taste. I just install all of my  
libs in the "system" directory, and don't specify a personal one, but  
then again: my os x box is just a single user machine.

I assume you mean for you personal debugging of the package - sure,  
but you could as well use just a shell script  ...

However, for real use you should not be installing from a directory in  
the first place - you should be using R CMD build to create the tar  
ball and then R CMD INSTALL for the archs - and you need no manual  
intervention for that. (The whole point of R not building all archs if  
you have configure or Makefile is exactly that it's hard to clean the  
unpacked tar ball after one arch has been built - in theory files  
could have been modified beyond repair so the only safe way to proceed  
is to remove everything and unpack it again.).

The main two options are system-wide installation (R_HOME/library) for  
users with admin rights or user-local installation (~/R/library/x.y  
where x.y is the R version). Those two are supported by R out of the  
box. Generally I don't recommend the latter on single-user machines,  
because people often forget about packages in one or the other  
location so it's common that you get package version mismatches which  
lead to all sorts of problems. On admin-maintained systems (good  
planning) it's usually not an issue, but it often is on personal  
machines.

Cheers,
Simon

Message-ID: <4F494C4A-1A5F-4E67-9675-8BBAC594EBF0@ric-me.com>

Hi all,

A little help in plotting 4D data. I have a file with x,y,z,v data.

For each x,y values there are different z & v values: The data is from  
CPT testing where there is a resistance measure taken at the tip, at  
even intervals, as the probe is driven into the ground.

x1,y1,z1,v1
x1,y1,z2,v2
.....

what I would like to do is plot a volume plot of the x,y,z data in  
different colours, where the colours are based on the values of v.

Thank you in advance.

Regards

Domenico

Jeff,

Perhaps you have a gfortan lurking around from Xcode 3.1. ?You'll need
to replace that w/ the version from CRAN.

Issues related to Snow Leopard have cropped up a bit on the list the
last couple weeks. ?It might be worthwhile to look for some of Simon
Urbanks message over the last month or so. ?He provided some detailed
step by steps for making sure your system has the right tools.

You've not (neither of you) told us the 'at a minimum' information 
required in the posting guide, so you have made it unnecessarily 
difficult to help you debug your mistakes.  This is a symptom of 
sending (e.g.) latin-1 text to R running in a UTF-8 locale.  So check 
sessionInfo() (run in the same way you send these commands) and check 
the encoding of your Aquamacs buffers.

And I suspect you are using ESS to send code from Aquamacs to R, so 
see the R FAQ Q6.1 for where to ask for further help.

Thanks for the response. I set language to german, and my sessioninfo
is shown below. Setting language to german (in Aquamacs) did not
change this behaviour.

I found the solution. I ran in Terminal.app

> defaults write org.R-project.R force.LANG fi_Fi.UTF-8

and after that edited .bash_profile by adding these lines into it:

export LC_ALL=fi_FI.UTF-8
export LANG=fi_FI.UTF-8

Now everything works fine and sessionInfo() looks like this

> sessionInfo()
R version 2.9.2 (2009-08-24)
i386-apple-darwin8.11.1

locale:
fi_FI.UTF-8/fi_FI.UTF-8/C/C/fi_FI.UTF-8/fi_FI.UTF-8

attached base packages:
[1] stats     graphics  grDevices utils     datasets  methods   base

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Error when trying to compile R-devel
Message-ID: <4ABF4682.6070106@aon.at>

Dear All,

In order to test my package with the newest R-devel I wanted to install 
R-devel on my Mac Tiger 10.4.11.

First I downloaded "R-devel-48594.dmg", however the installer says "This 
multi-package is missing tools that are necessary to build R packages 
from sources". Although I have currently installed "R-2.9.1.dmg" I am 
not sure if the installed tools will work with R-devel, so I did not 
install it.

Instead I downloaded the newest source "R-devel.tar.gz" (9/27/09) and 
wanted to build it:
$ cd /Volumes/CoreData/CRAN
$ tar -zxf R-devel.tar.gz
$ cd /Volumes/CoreData/CRAN/R-devel
$ ./configure --with-blas='-framework vecLib' F77=/usr/local/bin/gfortran
$ make

Configure did work, see the output below.
However, when running make I get the following error:

building package 'tcltk'

mkdir ../../../library/tcltk/R

Do you know the reason for this error?

Sure, they do. The "tools" it's talking about are simply the GNU  
Fortran with you can also download separately from CRAN if you care,  
but you have it already if you installed any recent R.

Well, if you thought the tools don't work - how do you expect to build  
R? ;) Just pick the binary and you'll be fine.

Dear Simon,

Thank you for your reply, I have now installed "R-devel-48594.dmg" and 
my package passed "R CMD check" w/o problems.

Nevertheless, I would be interested to know why I could not compile the 
source.
The problem appears when trying to buid package "tcltk".  What does "for 
architecture x86_64 object: /usr/local/lib/libtk8.5.dylib malformed 
object (unknown load command 7) mean?

Best regards
Christian

It means that the linker is confused about the 64-bit Intel binary of  
Tcl/Tk (the 64-bit version of Tcl/Tk is only for Leopard so it's not  
that surprising). However, I'm not sure why it's looking at 64-bit  
binaries, because Tiger doesn't have 64-bit X11 so you cannot build 64- 
bit R on Tiger out of the box. I would suggest that you use -arch i386  
when configuring R to make sure the linker is looking at 32-bit only.

This is mostly what the CRAN build uses:

CC="gcc -arch i386 -std=gnu99" CXX="g++ -arch i386" OBJC="gcc -arch  
i386 -std=gnu99" F77="gfortran -arch i386" FC="gfortran -arch i386"

Cheers,
Simon

There is sufficient circumstantial evidence to suggest you are posting  
in the wrong mailing list. Follow-up should go there.  You also have  
not posted sessionInfo() output or the error messages you are getting  
when <what-ever-it-is-that-you-have-done> that "didn't work". You  
should post in R-SIG-Mac and include the appropriate information  
requested in the Posting Guide (sessionInfo(), console output prior to  
error message, and error messages).

There is a binary package called devpack4 at:

http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools/

I don't see libtiff in there, but libjpeg which biOps requires  
(according to the docs) is in there. If you are going to compile from  
sources you should read that information carefully.

I got this error when I tried to load the binary installed package:
 > library(biOps)
Error in dyn.load(file, DLLpath = DLLpath, ...) :
   unable to load shared library '/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/ 
Resources/library/biOps/libs/x86_64/biOps.so':
   dlopen(/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/library/biOps/libs/ 
x86_64/biOps.so, 6): Symbol not found: _TIFFClose
   Referenced from: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/library/ 
biOps/libs/x86_64/biOps.so
   Expected in: dynamic lookup

Compiling from sources using the GUI Package Installer succeeded and  
the package loaded without error.

I did encounter some warnings in the check phase:

checking fftw3.h usability... no
checking fftw3.h presence... no
checking for fftw3.h... no
checking jpeglib.h usability... configure: WARNING: Can't find fftw3  
header
yes
checking jpeglib.h presence... yes
checking for jpeglib.h... yes
checking tiff.h usability... no
checking tiff.h presence... no
checking for tiff.h... no
configure: WARNING: Can't find libtiff header

My scan of the compilation messages suggested that the lack of tiff  
support was not remedied in the process but I cannot be sure about  
that (see below). In the past (say a year ago) I generally needed to  
compile from sources if I were using the 64-bit GUI, but that is an  
unusual occurrence more recently. Being a UNIX-noob, I cannot tell  
whether this error was due to my being in the 64 bit configuration.   
Whether the package will do anything useful now, I cannot say:

capabilities() still reported FALSE for tiff

The first example in hte documentation produces a black square
 > jpeg()
 > p <- q <- seq(-1, 1, length=20)
 > r <- 1 - outer(p^2, q^2, "+") / 2
 > plot(imagedata(r))
 > dev.off()
null device
           1

The second example I tried produced a very pretty picture of a flower:

 > x <- readJpeg(system.file("samples", "violet.jpg", package="biOps"))
 > cat("Image Type", imageType(x))
Image Type rgb
 >
 > x
size:  499 x 333
type:  rgb
 > plot(x)

(And plotting to the tiff device produces a nice flower, despite what  
capabilities says.)

Best of luck;

Dear Simon,

Thank you, I have now done:

$ ./configure --with-blas='-framework vecLib' --with-lapack --with-ICU 
CC="gcc -arch i386 -std=gnu99" CXX="g++ -arch i386" OBJC="gcc -arch i386 
-std=gnu99" F77="gfortran -arch i386" FC="gfortran -arch i386"
$ make

However, the error remains the same. At the moment it does not matter 
since I have installed your binary.

Best regards
Christian

Hello,

The attached file patches the configure script so that the full  
install path is used in libR.dylib when doing a non-Framework build. I  
have tested it under 10.5 and 10.6 using the FSF version 4.3 compiler  
family. Please feel free to include it in R if you think it would be  
useful.

Kjell

What is the point of this exercise? R is relocatable until installed,  
so you cannot embed any paths and configure time and the above patch  
won't work (also try make install rhome=/foo and see it break). To be  
precise R won't even care because DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH overrides the path  
but then the question is why to embed it at all since it is incorrect?

Cheers,
Simon

## Sorry - just realized I replied to the last message off-list ##

OK, I see what's going on. R CMD is setting DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH but  
after Python is already running so nothing happens. Looks like I'l be  
setting those paths by hand.

Thanks for your help,
Kjell

That shouldn't be a problem - DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH is dynamic on Darwin  
(unlike LD_LIBRARY_PATH on some systems) so changes *do* become active  
immediately. Are you sure you're not setting it in a different  
environment? This seems more like an issue in Rpy, not in R ...

Cheers,
Simon

(I should add that this all is only an issue when not using the  
framework which is much easier since you can query everything from the  
bundle which is why R.app can work even without R CMD)

You're right - I had it confused with LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] R/PL cannot build - R/PL without recompiling?
Message-ID: <40F101C0-6059-4786-9159-89C25E17F32E@lautloscrew.com>

Just changed the list from r-help to this one and hope i am in the  
right place now.
i am trying to get PL / R running on Mac OS X. PostgreSQL is already  
running and connects just smoothly to R via DBI / RPostgreSQL .
I use Mac OS 10.5.7 and PostgreSQL 8.3.7 as well as R 2.9.2

I just read that R / PL does work without recompiling (with enable  
share) on Mac OS X without recompiling and i try to find out how...

so far I put the untared plr to my /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/ 
Resources/
If i just add the path mentioned above to the Makefile and run  
USE_PGXS=1 make :

i get the following error message:

make: pg_config: Command not found
make: *** No targets.  Stop.

If simply run make inside the plr directory i get the following:

Makefile:41: ../../src/Makefile.global: No such file or directory
Makefile:42: /contrib/contrib-global.mk: No such file or directory
make: *** No rule to make target `/contrib/contrib-global.mk'.  Stop.


If I change R_HOME in the makefile to Users/myname (which is supposed  
to be my R home and initial working directory) I get the following  
error message:


*** Cannot build PL/R because libR is not a shared library.
*** You might have to rebuild your R installation.  Refer to
*** the documentation for details.

This is a message i found already on several posts. Some answers  
suggest to recompile R with the shared lib option enabled. Anyway,  
some posts suggests that it is possible without recompiling. I?d  
really like to know how...

Thx in advance for any suggestions !
