Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] What are the modifier keys for "Hide Others"
Message-ID: <40e66e0b0605010833o4d214a49x60b20d3e91abf08c@mail.gmail.com>

Sorry to keep asking dumb questions about using OS X but I have not
been able to decide what the combination of shortcut keys for the
"Hide Others" GUI selection is.  I know that "Hide Application" is
Apple-H but I don't know what modifier key is represented by that
backwards 7 symbol that is to be chorded with Apple-H for "Hide
Others".

That's the "option" key (aka "alt" key). Interestingly enough the  
symbol used there is printed as such on some keyboards (e.g. the  
German version of the Apple keyboard), but it's not on the US  
version. Don't ask me why :).

Cheers,
Simon

Ours is not to reason why :-)

Thanks.  I thought that I had tried that but apparently I hadn't. 
Switching keyboards and operating systems often leaves one trying
these hand-cramping multi-modifier-key combinations seemingly at
random.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] problems with quartz device windows
Message-ID: <25D008DA-AA09-48C8-8C9B-8F27CA38FC90@charite.de>

Hi

I have problems when saving quartz device windows to pdf files in the  
new R.app (v1.15).

Is it a feature or a bug that the new R.app only accepts the  
extension '.Quartz Graphics'? In former versions it was possible to  
choose 'pdf'. The file saved with the new R.app still seems to be a  
pdf file.

Moreover, I have problems with the quartz device windows. When  
switching between them via the Window menu R.app crashes from time to  
time (see report below). Also the 'Save As' dialog sometimes does not  
disappear when saving the quartz device window and I am not possible  
to get rid of it. I was not able to find a way to reproduce the  
problems but they occured several times in the last two days.

Tilo

Yes, Matt Cohen did provide the solution for this one earlier on the  
list, use the DISPLAY setting instead of the X11 parameter, so  
something like this should work

Sys.putenv(DISPLAY=":0.0")
X11()

Sure: Info.plist in the GUI used to set DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH to $R_HOME/ 
lib for historical reasons - this was necessary before we started  
linking libR.dylib with the full path (AFAIR that was R 2.0.0 or  
earlier). R 2.3.0 now comes with custom gcc libraries (from gcc  
4.0.3) thus setting DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH overrides the default search  
path so the corresponding system libraries are no longer used even if  
other applications require them.
My tests didn't show it, because it doesn't hurt a vanilla system -  
R.app works and there are no other modules, but if the user installed  
some extra modules that are loaded at run-time (e.g. input helpers,  
haxies etc.), those require the system version of the libraries, so  
they fail, sometimes even killing R.app as well.

Cheers,
Simon

I just upgraded to R 2.3.0, which I downloaded from
http://cran.stat.ucla.edu/bin/macosx/.  I can get R to work from the
commandline by typing "r", but when I launch R.app, it displays
"Loading R..." in the status bar at the bottom and never gives me a
prompt to start typing commands.  If I click on the R Console, I get
the spinning beach ball.  The only thing I can do is Force Quit the
application.

Does anyone have any ideas on how to fix this?  I'm running 10.4.6 on
a G4 Powerbook.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Update all error
Message-ID: <C07D3581.4621%I.Visser@uva.nl>

I just upgraded to R 2.3.0:

platform       powerpc-apple-darwin8.6.0
arch           powerpc
os             darwin8.6.0

svn rev        37909
language       R   
version.string Version 2.3.0 (2006-04-24)

And subsequently tried to update all my installed packages using update all
from the R package installer, which resulted in the following:

...[downloading packages went fine]

If I update just a single package there are no problems.

Any hints about the cause of this are welcome.

I cannot reproduce the Save As dialog box problem, but the extension

Fixed in 3114 as well - thanks for spotting this one (it also  
affected file.show if the file was not in UTF-8 encoding).

This is fixed in the 3112 already (also available from CRAN).

Note to all: it is highly recommended to update at least to revision  
3112 (available from CRAN), because of the important bugfix discussed  
here earlier (startup etc.). Using nightly builds usually doesn't  
hurt, either.

After I upgraded to R 2.3.0, the "Open in Editor" icon in the R
console toolbar disappeared. It did leave a blank space in place,
which does work when I click on it. I just have to remember it's
hidden! I'm using a PowerPC G4 PowerBook, running OS X 10.4.6.

I did not notice the problem before the email myself, but it was  
there... I downloaded the new dmg and installed it, but the problem  
(i.e. no icon for 'Open in Editor') is still there.

R 2.3.0, OS 10.4.6 PPC.

Thanks, I missed that one, it's fixed now (rev. 3117, download

Thanks, but as the fact I did not notice the first time round shows,  
I am actually not really terribly bothered by that problem (I use  
emacs for writing R code. I know, I know, I will burn in hell...).

Message-ID: <4047B492-E3C3-46B2-966D-67D7B56BD352@mid-town.org>

I can't find any reference to this in the archives.

Since upgrading to 2.3.0, closed Quartz windows do not seem to be  
getting properly "cleared" from the Windows menu.

Example: in R.app, open a new quartz window with quartz(). Close the  
window using either Cmd-W or the upper left-hand 'X' button. A  
listing for "Quartz (2) - Active" will persist in the Windows menu.  
Iterating this procedure will leave additional "Quartz (2) - Active"  
entries.

This usually means that you have an old package for R 2.2.0 and you  
are trying to use it in R 2.3.0. *)

AFAIR rgl is currently broken, so there is no binary:
http://r.research.att.com/reports/tiger-universal/results/2.3.0/html/ 
rgl.report.html
I remember fixing this a while ago - it wasn't as simple as casting,  
because the structures are wrong, but I'll see if I can dig out the fix.

My guess is that you forgot to re-install them (or you have old local  
packages somewhere). This happens most often if you install libraries  
in your home directory. On OS X it's usually much safer to use system- 
wide packages, because that prevents cross-version problems, version- 
confusion and the GUI allows you to re-install them automatically.  
That doesn't work for your local packages in home.

Cheers,
Simon

*) - for completeness, you also get this error if you install a  
binary that was not built for the universal R or if the ppc  
architecture build failed. However, neither should not happen with  
CRAN binaries.

Message-ID: <20060505160756.28207.qmail@web53710.mail.yahoo.com>

Good morning. I am considering buying a new computer to develop an R
package for multi-dimensional Monte Carlo simulation. One requirement
is to call, from R, a Fortran 90 program about 1000 lines of code. A
C++ version of that program is also available if desired.  Will the new
Core Duo Mac be a good development platform in the sense that I will
not need to struggle with too many technicalities in linking R with the
compiled code? I am asking this because I saw that the binary Mac R
distribution in fact has compilers bundled in it. I currently work
mostly on Windows and was told that I will have a lot to download and
configure if developing on Windows. 

Thanks in advance.

Oops, sorry about my "more commonly used platform" comment.  I thought 
this was an older Mac platform, not a current one.

A simple fix for the error shown on that page is in the patch below. 
(The line numbers don't match because I'm working with an unreleased 
version.)  I'm hoping there will be another release soon; there are some 
additions to rgl.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] crash in R-app when selecting Packages & data - Data
	manager
Message-ID: <6DFF7007-1096-468F-AC18-DE7C56C2D313@globetrotter.net>

Here is the log. I had done nothing yet in my session, not typed a  
single line. I just wanted to see if I could use this command to see  
what built-in datasets were available in base and packages, hopefully  
even those not loaded in R yet.

Stefano,

can you, please, check the nightly build? This should be fixed in  
3117. It was the same bug that caused "What's new" to not work.

Cheers,
Simon

in general I think Macs are pretty painless in terms of developing  
packages for R. Most tools come right from Apple with the operating  
system. To complement that the fortran compiler supplied with R (GNU  
Fortran 95) supports F90, so you should be safe (although I'm not  
sure how versatile such package would be). At the development stage  
you shouldn't worry about universal binaries, either. Admittedly, I  
develop even Windows programs on my Mac, because I find it easier to  
cross-compile for Windows on a Mac than to do it in the horrible  
Windows GUI, but that's another story ;). I don't know if that helps,  
but those are just my 2 cents.
However, if you're interested in raw speed (i.e. you actually want to  
run the simulations), you may be better off using dual-core AMD  
Opterons with Linux or Quad-G5 PowerMacs - the Intel CPUs are not  
necessarily fast (although Apple tries to make you believe  
otherwise ;)).

Simon

There are various reasons why the Mac is not the best option if you
want raw speed.

-- The current dual core Intel chips used in Macs are mainly developed  
for portables (i.e. they emphasize power saving). The next generation,
available in July/August, will do a better job and will be used in the
new towers.

-- The G5 is not designed to do fast floating point, and generally does
not do a very good job at it.

-- OS X is handicapped by the Mach microkernel parts. This is becoming
more and more obvious in webserving, database management, and  
distributed
computing. Rumor has it that Apple is working on both replacing the
kernel and the HFS+ file system.

For my work this is all pretty irrelevant, but many others care. And  
with
good reason.

I do think, however, that the Mac, expecially the MacBook Pro,  is a  
pretty good
development machine -- especially my MacBook Pro, since it now  
painlessly virtualizes
XP Pro, Debian, and Solaris 10 as well.

Thank you very much, both Simon and Prof. Leeuw. My focus is on the
ease  of development. Based on your feedback, Mac will be a good
choice. About the raw speed, I am using a Pentium M 1.7 Ghz notebook
and am extremely impressed by its speed (had been so frustrated by the
slow Sun Sparc workstation). 

I am not worried about cross-platform at this point. I am working on
some preliminary result for a grant proposal. I also like to listen to
music while I work and Mac would be a better choice than Linux for that
purpose.

pretty off-topic for this list, but we have pretty good luck with our Sun 
boxes here... depending on the task.

What sort of SPARC machine were you using, for what kind of task?

Sometimes we're better off on SPARC than on the G5.

I am running 2.1.0 and am using the IBMXL Fortran Compiler.  It has .a

Is there a way to load these libraries or convert them to .so's?

How are you compiling them? I don't see how you can get either .a  
or .dylib using R CMD SHLIB, so my guess is that it has nothing to do  
with the compiler but with the way you compile the sources. On OS X  
package libs are neither dynamic libraries (.dylib) nor static  
libraries (.a) - they are bundles. The compilation shouldn't matter  
and if in doubt you should be able to use gcc for the linking step in  
case the IBM compiler is not compatible.

There is no converting, you should get the right .so directly  
otherwise you're doing something wrong. Please tell us more precisely  
what you're doing.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Problems with R.app GUI
Message-ID: <10334075.1147315344109.JavaMail.bboucek@mac.com>

I am experiencing the same problem/flaw in the GUI for R 2.3.0 that a few other people have posted concern about. 

With R-GUI-3121-2.3
Entering demo() at the prompt results in the following message:
2006-05-10 12:31:26.370 open[1512] LSOpenFromURLSpec() returned -10814 for application (null) urls file://localhost/tmp/Rtmp04NeEd/RpackageIQR10d63af1.
Entering library() at the prompt results in the production of a TextEdit file titled "RlibraryIQR60b7acd9"
and available libraries are listed in this file.

With R-GUI-3114-2.3
When I try demo() or library() a window should be produced that contains a list of demos and libraries respectively (if they are available with the libraries currently loaded). The windows are not generated and there is no feedback from the prompt or GUI.
Additionally when one uses the the package manager, package installer, and data manager from the GUI, they work correctly until one closes them. Even though they are closed they continue to be available in the Window menu.

I had the errors above using R.app in both an Admin account and in a user account without admin privileges.
My system is a Powerbook G4 1.67 GHz with 1 GB of ram running Mac OS X 10.4.6
I had no difficulties with R-2.2.1.

As an aside - 
For those having similar problems, I recommend using R in the terminal with library(tcltk). One note though, apparently something has changed in the implementation of X11R6 on MacOSX 10.4. I used to have my display variable set in my bash .profile as:

export DISPLAY=0:0

Apparently the correct setting is now:

export DISPLAY=:0.0

I haven't yet explored the reason for this, I just know that it works.

I hope I have provided enough information to assist in identifying my problem and the continued debugging effort with the GUI.

Thanks for any and all assistance.
Cheers

Bruce

I am sorry if I was not completely clear.  The .a's and the .dylibs are 
part of the distribution with the IBM Compiler.  The R CMD SHLIB works 
just fine.

Compiling the .f to a .o works fine.
The R CMD SHLIB also works fine to generate the .so.
The dyn.load of the .so fails with a set of unresolved symbols that are 
part of one of the libraries from IBM.

So I think you answered my question.  I will try the gcc route.

Thanks.

Ok, I'll check that one - we need a more clean solution for external  
files, so it may be worth changing a bit more.

This is wrong and it was pure luck that it worked. The format is  
[<host>]:<display>[.<screen>] so you're asking for host "0" which is  
invalid.

Yes and always was.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Axis labels drawn double in plot
Message-ID: <C088D542.3A0CD%tim.bates@ed.ac.uk>

As you can see in the attached plot pdf, the y axis labels are double typed
with a small offset, making them somewhat useless.

I can see now that this is my fault, as I was passing the x and ylab
parameters each time, but I can?t see why these don?t overlay perfectly?

The commands to generate the plot were

plot(function(x)dnorm(x,100,15)*100, 50, 150, main = "IQ distribution", xlab
= "IQ", ylab = "proportion")
par(new=TRUE)
plot(function(x)dnorm(x,100-15,15)*100, 50, 150, main = "IQ distribution",
xlab = "IQ", ylab = "proportion")
par(new=TRUE)
plot(function(x)dnorm(x,100+15,15)*100, 50, 150, main = "IQ distribution",
xlab = "IQ", ylab = "proportion")

The xlim and ylims are chosen independently for each plot.  You probably
want to look at using lines() or points() to produce the second and third
plots on top of the first.

This isn't really a mac-specific question, so in the future you can ask on
r-help for general R questions.

Message-ID: <b31749290605111258n467e2f37y8824be812cd811d3@mail.gmail.com>

This is my first post on the list. I searched through the archives and
didn't find anything up-to-date on this subject, so I figured I should
ask.

I'm trying to run someone else's code that uses a LAPACK routine,
using the downloaded R binary. Is it possible, or do I have to
download the sources and make using the --with-blas="-framework
vecLib" option?

By the way, I haven't figured out how the business of LAPACK driver
routines works, nor have I found a direct explanation anywhere. Could
somebody enlighten me?

Thanks in advance,

The best way to do this is to create a package from the code and
include in the src directory a file called Makevars with the line

PKG_LIBS = $(LAPACK_LIBS) $(BLAS_LIBS)

See section 1.2.1 of the manual "Writing R Extensions" on any of the CRAN sites.

By the LAPACK driver routines do you mean the C functions that are
called by R functions like `svd'?  It is neither easy nor necessary to
understand how those work if you only want to call Lapack from
compiled code in a package.  Those C functions are difficult to
understand because they must allow for internal or external Lapack and
BLAS libraries.  In the case of code that will be compiled in a
package all that needs to be done is to link it against the correct
library at compile time, which is a much easier process.

Not a direct answer to your question, but most of BioConductor installs just
fine as "source" packages on my Mac.  Before you decide to try to reinstall,
you might try installing source packages.

Dear all,

In R-Gui R [Cocoa GUI 1.16-pre (3114)], edit() using the internal  
editor seem to be broken, try:

zzz <- function() {}
zzz <- edit(zzz)

it is easy to define an external editor, so it's not big priority!
Anyway - MANY Thanks for making R available on MacOS!

You can test them if you use http://r.research.att.com/bioc/ as the  
repository.

If your 2.2 installation is still complete, yes. However, depending  
on your setup, Apple installer may have removed the older R - in that  
case you need to re-install 2.2.1.

And just to clarify, the error in affxparser is special to that  
package, and has nothing to do with the rest of the Bioconductor  
packages.

is added to the default library search path when this is checked is

 $HOME/Library/R/library

Hi,

Sorry for the false alarm.  After starting R with --no-restore,  
everything worked. Apparently my workspace images are all corrupted.

Hmm, did you really work with the 'lmer.R' source file instead
of just
   library(lme4)
or library(Matrix)  ?

Since Matrix has a name space -- as many other "modern" R
packages, you cannot just work with one (out of many) R source
files from the package.
If really want to use some of the package R source files,
you better use them all.
If you use
   example(source)
in R 2.3.0 ("or newer"),
you can subsequently use   sourceDir("..../Matrix/R")

Note that if this answer has been helpful, 
it means that your problem has not been related to "Mac" at all,
and you should rather have used the 'R-help' mailing list.

Can you confirm?

Dear Martin Maechler,

I did use library(Matrix) and library(lme4). I used lmer.R only in so
far as I extracted the "lmerControl" function (and subsequently the
"subbars" function) from this file to see where lmer would go if these
functions are provided by me.

The problem went away when I deleted .RData files from home or working
directories (or started R with the -- no-restore option). So I suspect
that these files did not get removed (or updated) when I upgraded from
2.2.1 to 2.3.0.  This could be a MacOS X problem or a R problem or ?
most likely ? my problem.

Please let me know if you think further clarification would be useful.

Best
Reinhold

the R-GUI is 3132  deployment... should I upgrade? more generally, is

I see... unfortunately the R-GUI-3132-2.3-Deployment.dmg link seems  
broken at the moment.

The Deployment/Debug tells you only how 'chatty' is the build ;).

Currently it is safe to use the nightly builds, because there is no  
big construction in progress, so they are in fact just bugfixes (and  
hence highly recommended ;)). We are contemplating a re-write, but we  
wouldn't do that without branching off first, so it should be safe  
for a while.

Cheers,
Simon

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] installing rggobi-2.1.3 under Mac OS X
Message-ID: <C40DD664-83F3-4C1C-AE36-1A739F3F5661@uni-potsdam.de>

Hi,

I am crossposting this to ggobi-help and  r-sig-mac. There were some  
recent posts reporting problems.

  I got rggobi working under Mac OS X 10.4.6 and R 2.3.0.  I  started  
darwinx (>startx -- -quartz) and >ggobi. Then I started R from the  
command line and from the GUI. I  only  tried  g <- ggobi(mtcars) and  
it worked; no extensive testing of any sort.

I had to do various other things  before and after the darwinport  
installation. So it might be useful to document this here for other  
MacOS X users.  I used the gcc-4.0 compiler. (The ggobi download page  
could be updated in this respect.)

(1) Before activating the darwinport,  I had to rename
.../X11R6 to .../X11R6.apple

I think this means that I no longer have Apple's X11; I read along  
the way that is possible to keep them both.
Does anybody know how to do this?

(2) During activating the darwinport, quite a few libraries were not  
found (e.g., atk). I fetched them from other sites and put them in  
the .../distr folder.

(3) After activiating the darwinport, I had to put the following  
statements into my .bashrc to get a window.
# Make sure you have the "port" command after installation
export PATH=/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:$PATH

#  Get a display
if [[ -z DISPLAY ]]; then
   export DISPLAY=:0.0
fi

(4) Then ggobi complained that I had version 1 of libfontconfig and  
that it wants version 2. The following did the trick:
sudo port upgrade fontconfig

(5) During startup, ggobi complained that  hicolor-icon-theme was not  
available. Again:
sudo port upgrade hicolor-icon-theme

(6) Finally, compiling rggobi was a bit tricky, too.  On the download  
page, you might want to add a note to the effect that Mac OS X Users  
probably have to add /opt/local/bin to their PATH and set  
PKG_CONFIG_PATH to /opt/local/lib/pkgconfig:/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig.  
You also may want to remove "ggobirc" from the "mkdir ..." line of  
the LINUX segment of the webpage.

So good luck to everybody. If you try to upgrade soon, I might be  
able to help. In about 2 weeks I will have forgotten everything.

Best
Reinhold

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] new GUI
Message-ID: <933BA4D7-BBC3-4871-B1AD-FAF76A245F25@mac.com>

Hello Maintainers,

I just wanted to mention, that the new GUI (ref 3141), which was  
recommended as an update when updating to R 2.3.0 still exhibits some  
undesired behaviour. So i can't save images from the quartz device as  
pdf anymore. The programme wants to save as Quartz image. So i can do  
this and then later open the file in preview and saving it as a pdf.  
but before it was much more convenient. Maybe it is a general problem  
with the Quartz devices: Often i got two of them automatically and  
one is always empty and it's not possible to get rid of it. This  
doesn't cause any further problem it is just a bit nagging.
However, i greatly appreciate your effort of bringing R to Aqua, and  
i am happy that i finally found R and learned (beginner stage) how to  
use it. One wish: The status region at the bottom of the console  
window could be a bit bigger (or growing, to always display the whole  
function usage) and the font used there could be a bit bigger (or  
adjustable).

Thank you
Gerald Jurasinski

P.S. Does anybody know a programme or package capable of producing  
two-dimensional correlograms (Oden & Sokal 1986)?

Hello,

Sorry to bother you, but I have a problem installing R-2.3.0 from source. 
'configure' and 'make' produce no error, and the R executable seems to run
fine (particularly, R --version does work), but 'make install' fails with
the following error message :

% sudo make install
Password:
make[1]: Nothing to be done for `install'.
make[1]: Nothing to be done for `install'.
installing doc ...
help2man: can't get `--version' info from ../bin/R
make[1]: *** [R.1] Error 22
make: *** [install] Error 1

R-2.2.1 compiles and installs without problem. Using MacOS 10.4.6 on a
powerMac G5 with XCode 2.2.1.

Thank you,
Jean

Hi -

I posted a little while ago about the same problem, as did Michael  
Toews. I've tried to follow this up. The short answer is that R  
2.3.0's version string doesn't conform to what the help2man.pl  
utility expects. The help2man.pl script gets version information from  
R --version and makes a man page from it. Here is the relevant line  
of the Makefile inside the doc/ directory of the R-2.3.0 source code  
bundle:

> @$(HELP2MAN) --include=$(srcdir)/R.aux --no-info --output=R.1 \
>           --name="a language for data analysis and graphics" \
>           $(top_builddir)/bin/R

The help2man script wants the version information in a specific form  
Here is 2.3.0's version info (without the copyright message, which  
doesn't matter for the error):

> [Deiseal] ~/downloads/R-2.3.0/doc % ../bin/R --version
> R version 2.3.0 (2006-04-24)

And here is 2.2.1:

> [Deiseal] ~ % R --version
> R 2.2.1 (2005-12-20).

The extra word 'version' is what does it.

The roots of this issue are in src/main/version.c, which contains the  
code that produces the text of the version message. It has changed  
since 2.2.1. The changed code includes a function whose comments say,  
more or less, "this is a workaround designed to make GNU tools like  
help2man happy," together with information about how the version  
message will change in the next version of R. So I guess the authors  
of the code are aware of this issue, but for whatever reason it still  
arises on some macs. I'm afraid I don't' know C, so I can't diagnose  
any further.

As a short-term, completely ad hoc workaround, I ran the help2man  
command in the Makefile directly, but pointed it at my already- 
installed version of R (2.2.1) instead. I.e., from inside the doc/  
directory in the R 2.3.0 sources, and assuming you have R 2.2.1  
already installed, do

> perl ../tools/help2man.pl --include=./R.aux --no-info --output=R.1
> --name="a language for data analysis and graphics"  R

(This should all be one line.) This produces a file called R.1  
containing version information, which is the desired goal, but with  
version info from R.2.2.1 instead of 2.3.0. You can edit the first  
line of the file to make the version number correct if you like. Then  
you can comment out the equivalent section in  doc/Makefile, viz,

> #@$(HELP2MAN) --include=$(srcdir)/R.aux --no-info --output=R.1 \
> #         --name="a language for data analysis and graphics" \
> #         $(top_builddir)/bin/R


Doing 'sudo make install' as usual (from the top-level source  
directory) will then work, as the R.1 file is now present in the doc  
directory. Of course this doesn't change the usual output of R -- 
version (you'd have to edit version.c to do that), just the  
information in the man page.

Obviously is not any kind of proper solution, but I'm afraid I don't  
know C, or the ins-and-outs of R's source code in great detail. I'm  
not sure why this issue only appears on some macs (e.g., my iBook)  
and not others (e.g., by G5 tower).

Best,

Kieran

Out-of-the-box, no. Theoretically, yes. Practically, possibly  
(untested).

The only problem (AFAICS) is that Tiger installed on PPC machines  
doesn't contain Intel system libraries. Although the gcc we are  
providing can compile i686 binaries on ppc machines, the final  
linking step fails, because the system libraries are missing. So the  
solution could be to add i686 system libraries to ppc Tiger.

The 'official' way to do it is to use Xcode 10.4u SDK, but R is not  
aware of this concept which is local to Xcode. (Idea: lipo the i686  
system libraries from the SDK to the system)

> locations for ppc and intel OSX packages?

Sort of. Although you could do that, it doesn't make much sense,  
because if you had separate binary packages, you may as well create  
the universal one by copying their contents into one directory.  
However, CRAN R is universal, so you cannot offer different kind of  
packages. This is how it works in detail:

Package installation:
- requests file from the current architecture's directory (e.g. ppc)
Repository (convention used by CRAN, but not enforced in any way):
- all universal packages are in `architecture' directory "universal"
- "ppc" and "i686" point symlinks to "universal"
Universal packages are tagged as "Built: universal-apple-darwinXXX"

Since even the universal R is looking for arch-specific packages, you  
cannot have two different builds of R (this was never supposed to  
work). You can, however, opt to create package for the universal R  
that contains binary for only one architecture. You could put this  
binary in the corresponding 'ppc' or 'i686' tree. In that case it  
will appear only on the appropriate architecture.

It depends - "universal" R has the property that it works as-is on  
either platform. Single-arch packages don't, so if you're using the  
same image or hd to boot different machines, only universal package  
will work. Therefore and given the fact that if you have package for  
each arch, you effectively have the universal binary, you're  
discouraged to create individual packages.

You can, of course, do that and create the universal package.  
Universal package is effectively nothing else but

R_ARCH=/i686 build foo for i686 in i686/foo
R_ARCH=/ppc build foo for ppc in ppc/foo
cp -r ppc/foo/libs/ppc i686/foo/libs/
pack foo in i686 and you have universal package

I doesn't matter whether you do that on a single machine or you use  
two. (Well-kept secret: universal R is built this way in order to be  
able to run make check natively. However, the packages are not).

As of external libraries - it's (mostly) not a problem, either,  
because you can simply lipo them together, even if you build them on  
another machine.

Cheers,
Simon

Franklin,

Can you please check on your system if below steps are repeatable:

1) Open a new editor window/file, leave it open,
2) Open an existing file
3) Open another existing file
4) Now close the window opened under 2).

Does 3) close as well?

I know there is a (serious) issue with the external editor, and I  
thought I had come across
it with quartz windows, so if your observation is correct, the  
threesome is complete :-)

Thanks,
Rob

Hi,
The problem is actually R's inability to print the version number  
normally .. for instance typing: './bin/R --version' produces the  
proper output, but './bin/R --version | cat' does not produce any  
output ('help2man' reads an empty strings, and throws an error).

The only solution for now is to download a pre-compiled version from  
CRAN, since it works perfectly (including 'R --version | cat').

However, I have tracked down the vulnerability to:
sys-std.c: In function 'pushReadline':
sys-std.c:497: warning: passing argument 2 of  
'rl_callback_handler_install' from incompatible pointer type
sys-std.c: In function 'popReadline':
sys-std.c:513: warning: passing argument 2 of  
'rl_callback_handler_install' from incompatible pointer type

The source file ./src/unix/sys-std.c refers to Apple's ReadLine on OS  
X 10.4-pre, and how it needs to be forced to flush the stdout to make  
it visible (this is exactly the problem described above from  
help2man). Simon fixed this almost a year ago (svn r33778), but it  
appears this problem has re-surfaced for some proportions of Macs.
I can provide a complete log from './configure', 'make' and 'sudo  
make install' to anyone interested in seeing.

Yes, (3) closes as well, but only most of the time ?!?  I did it 10  
times, and it closed 8 of those.

Upon further inspection, it appears (3) will close only if I click  
straightaway on the red X in the upper left corner of (2).  However,  
if I first make (2) active by clicking on, say, its title bar, and  
only then close it via the red X, (3) will remain open.

In an unsurprising turn of events it turns out to be malloc's fault.  
It also looks like the build isn't against an optimized BLAS?

Michael,

thanks for tracking this down, excellent work!
The reason for CRAN R binary working is simply that it uses GNU  
readline instead of Apple's libedit (which is disguised as readline  
btw).  A simple work-around is therefore to install GNU readline (see  
the R for Mac OS X FAQ for details, don't forget -DNEED_EXTERN_PC).

I think I may be able to reproduce this on my laptop, I'll try that  
tomorrow and see if I can fix it.

Cheers,
Simon

We had a discussion about this earlier, it started with
https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-mac/2006-March/002722.html

What it boils down to is that ptATLAS can give you a good speed-up,  
but it can also screw you up by calling malloc/free all the time - it  
depends on the task. For single core CPUs it's definitely better to  
use R's own BLAS. For Core Duos it depends on the size of the problem  
- for bigger problems ptATLAS is better, for smaller problems  
internal BLAS may be better.

In a quiet minute I'll try to run our benchmarks with Lea's allocator  
and see if it would make sense to use it for OS X.

Thanks,
Simon

Ah, sorry. I blame the dissertation for me missing that :-)

BTW, the ridiculous fish link has some benchmarking for the Lea  
allocator.

A posting from the Scitech mailing list may be of interest.

Accelerate's BLAS is currently not threaded on Intel.  The version
that is currently out was tuned for the developer preview machines
-- Pentium 4, uniprocessor. On those machines, threading just got   
mapped to hyperthreading which didn't do much but slow it down.

The other parts of Accelerate.framework should generally be in much
better shape. We're working hard to patch up the remaining holes.

Yes, thanks, I know - that's why we started the whole discussion in  
the first place. On i686 vecLib is just single-threaded ATLAS so it's  
the worst solution of all (it exhibits the same malloc/free problem  
as ptATLAS but without any speed up potential) - that's why the CRAN  
binary supplies ptATLAS. So the real options don't include vecLib, we  
are talking ptATLAS vs. internal BLAS here. Of course, we hope that  
Apple will supply a more reasonable vecLib at some point - they did a  
very good job with vecLib and G5 - but that's probably a distant future.

Cheers,
Simon

Well, it seems that it was only because I was using gcc 4.0 (because of
XCode 2.2.1, I suppose). After doing sudo gcc_select 3.3 everything went
well (including tkrplot, for which i had problems too :) ).

Is it possible to install the latest version of R on 10.3.9 ?
or i have to upgrade to Tiger?

If you meant the CRAN binary, no.

If you want to use CRAN binary, yes.

You can still compile latest R for 10.3.9 yourself and there are  
unofficial binaries around (look in the list archives). However, they  
are not maintained and you won't get latest fixes for the GUI unless  
you compile it yourself.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Several R installation issues
Message-ID: <446D48AD.8010405@fhcrc.org>

(Sorry in advance for the long story.)


Hi everybody,


I've run into several issues while trying to install different
versions of R on my Mac OS X 10.4.6 (Power PC) system.

I need to have both R-2.2.1 and R-2.3.0 on this machine.
I already have R-2.3.0 installed (I've installed the full R-2.3.0-mini.dmg):

  dhcp157137:~ compbio$ ls -al /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/
  total 24
  drwxrwxr-x   7 root  admin  238 May 16 17:46 .
  drwxrwxr-x   7 root  admin  238 May 16 17:45 ..
  lrwxr-xr-x   1 root  admin    5 Sep 16  2005 2.1 -> 2.1.1
  lrwxr-xr-x   1 root  admin    5 Sep 16  2005 2.1.0 -> 2.1.1
  drwxrwxr-x   3 root  admin  102 May 16 17:45 2.1.1
  drwxrwxr-x   6 root  admin  204 Apr 24 10:03 2.3
  lrwxr-xr-x   1 root  admin    3 May 16 17:46 Current -> 2.3

I've tried to install R-2.2.1 by using R-Framework-ppc.pkg included
in R-2.2.1-universal.dmg and got the following (problem A):

  You cannot install R Framework on this volume. This R-framework requires
  Mac OS X 10.3.9 or higher. Please update your OS or visit CRAN to check
  whether there is an older R version available for your OS.

Strange! As I said, I've Mac OS X 10.4.6.

Then I've tried to install R-2.2.1 by using R-Framework.pkg included
in powerpc/R-2.2.1.dmg:
  - I didn't have problem A anymore  :-) 
  - I was warned that "Installing this software will replace the newer version
    with an older version" which is OK.
  - I choosed "Continue" but then I got (problem B):
      You cannot continue. There is nothing to install.
     :-( 

So apparently, one _must_ use R.mpkg (either from R-2.2.1-universal.dmg
or powerpc/R-2.2.1.dmg) in order to succeed. 

BTW I've noted some small inconsistencies between installing from R-2.2.1-universal.dmg
versus installing from powerpc/R-2.2.1.dmg (in both case with R.mpkg):
  - The former doesn't warn me that I'm going to replace a newer version
    with an older one.
  - With the former I need to go in Customize in order to select the packages
    I want to install (they are all selected by default). With the latter,
    the list of choices is automatically shown to me (but nothing is selected
    by default).

After installing from powerpc/R-2.2.1.dmg, I was surprised that R 2.3.0
was _really_ removed:

  dhcp157137:/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions compbio$ ls -al
  total 24
  drwxrwxr-x   7 root  admin  238 May 18 19:55 .
  drwxrwxr-x   7 root  admin  238 May 18 19:55 ..
  lrwxr-xr-x   1 root  admin    5 Sep 16  2005 2.1 -> 2.1.1
  lrwxr-xr-x   1 root  admin    5 Sep 16  2005 2.1.0 -> 2.1.1
  drwxrwxr-x   3 root  admin  102 May 16 17:45 2.1.1
  drwxrwxr-x   6 root  admin  204 Dec 20 06:37 2.2
  lrwxr-xr-x   1 root  admin    3 May 18 19:55 Current -> 2.2

I know I was warned  ;-)  but I was expecting to have the "Current" symlink
changed only, not the 2.3 dir removed.

And if I reinstall R 2.3.0, then R 2.2.1 gets removed too :-/

No wait, not if R 2.2.1 was installed from R-2.2.1-universal.dmg !

(... a few minutes later ...)

Ughh, here is what I found: R-2.2.1-universal.dmg and R-2.3.0-mini.dmg
will friendly coexist under /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions.
But not powerpc/R-2.2.1.dmg and R-2.3.0-mini.dmg: in this case the last
installed will remove the other.
Also note that R 2.1.1 is _not_ removed when I install R-2.2.1-universal.dmg,
powerpc/R-2.2.1.dmg or R-2.3.0-mini.dmg. I must say that I'm a bit confused...

Once I've finally managed to have both R 2.2.1 and R 2.3.0 installed,
I run into one more problem:

  dhcp157137:/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions compbio$ ls -al
  total 24

I know I could just change the "Current" symlink everytime I need
to switch between my 2 versions of R but, of course, I'd like not
to have to do that.

Any help would be highly appreciated.

Thanks,

You're missing the necessary gdal library. I have no clue how you  
compiled it and you didn't tell us, either, so we can't really help  
you. My guess is that you don't have gdal installed at all.

Cheers,
Simon

Can you, please, describe exactly what steps are necessary to  
reproduce and your system? I cannot reproduce this on OS X 10.4.6  
(ppc) - it works fine.

Hi all,

After installation of labdsv Package MAnager fails to load the  
program with the following error message:

Jonathan,

thanks for reporting this. In fact a handful packages  
(labdsv,MNP,caTools and ftnonpar) were affected by this, probably a  
left-over from a manual build run. They have been all fixed and  
should become available from CRAN tomorrow.

If you don't want to wait, you have two options:
- install it directly from r.research.att.com, i.e.
install.packages("labdsv",,"http://r.research.att.com")
or
- install gcc4.0 from the R CRAN image

Thanks,
Simon

Hi Herve,

yes, all what you say is plausible and known - I understand your  
frustration ;).

1) there is a bug in the requirements check of R-Framework.pkg which  
gets bypassed if you run R.mpkg

2) Apple Installer is too smart and removes files of any other  
version. This was not really intended and I discovered this too late  
(once the ID is used, changing it doesn't help) - the problem is that  
there is no way to have an option "remove old" or "leave it".  
Unfortunately I can only change it for the R 2.4 installer. [see  
below for a work-around]

3) 2.2.1 universal vs ppc use entirely different AI packaging  
methods, so the differences are due to AI (and the fact that optional  
installs were not enabled before the univ. pkg).

I hope this makes it clearer :). 1) will be fixed in 2.3.1 installer,  
2) is highly annoying but can be fixed only in 2.4 installer, 3) is  
intentional.

However, there is a work-around for 2): before you start the  
installer, run
rm -rf /Library/Receipts/R-Framework.pkg
This way AI will 'forget' about the other already installed version.

Cheers,
Simon

Frustrated by mprobit I changed these flags in Resources/etc/Makeconf

SHLIB_CXXLDFLAGS = -flat_namespace -bundle -undefined suppress - 
Xlinker -m
SHLIB_FCLDFLAGS = -flat_namespace -bundle -undefined suppress - 
Xlinker -m
SHLIB_LDFLAGS = -flat_namespace -bundle -undefined suppress -Xlinker -m

So I added "-Xlinker -m" at the end. This changes errors to warnings  
when linking
a bundle with a flat namespace and with multiple definitions of the  
same symbol
in different files.

May not be wise but is usually harmless. Ultimately bundles should have
two-level namespaces. And/or package writers should define once and  
declare
extern elsewhere.

Dear all -

OS10.4.6, Powerbook G4
R 2.3.0
Version 1.16-pre (3152) GUI

Three issues :
(I have not been able to check on another machine. all are repeatable  
on my machine... even after deleting the plist file)

1) when opening a script file, that file is added in the window  
menu.  If one closes that file, and reopens it later, two instances  
of the file are now listed in the windos menu - i.e. when closing a  
file, it is not removed from the window menu. I can send a png pic if  
needed.

2) when opening a script from the file->open document or file->open  
recent, text edit, or whatever file editor has specified, is  
launching, even though I don't have the external editor ticked in the  
preferences.

3) It does not appear possible to permanently change the font size in  
the console or in scripts - using cmd-T accesses fonts to change it,  
but they don't hold.

Cheers
andrew

Andrew,

I can't reproduce 1) but the fix for 2) is simple. I'll check with  
Simon before
doing a putback.

Regards,
Rob

Known (see other posts here) and being worked on. Internally, the  
underlying document is never closed and yet it's not clear why.

Thanks, fixed in 3156.

Persistent font size is handled by Font->Bigger/Smaler (Cmd +/-), not  
by Cmd+T. For historical reasons this setting is global and set by  
the console (it dates back to the Aqua GUI). Possibly the whole font  
handling could use an overhaul, but for now it's a "feature" ;).

Simon

Fixed now in 3159. In addition, it is now possible to use shortcuts  
to jump between R console, editor and Quartz windows (Cmd+1/2/3  
respectively).

Message-ID: <7C00C6B8-7BF4-4739-83D0-34F29F138010@soc.soton.ac.uk>

Hi

I have a package that I'm testing.
It seems to install fine and it works, as far as I can tell.
For example, I can install the package, and use it,
  and source the test suite with no errors.

My problem is with R CMD check.

It passes (on another architecture) on R-2.2-0:

Robin-Hankins-Computer:~/scratch% R CMD check ./partitions_1.1-0.tar.gz
* checking for working latex ... OK

[snip]

make[1]: Leaving directory `/users/sat/rksh/partitions.Rcheck/tests'
OK
* creating partitions-manual.tex ... OK
* checking partitions-manual.tex ... OK




But it doesn't pass on R-2.3.0, MacOSX:



Robin-Hankins-Computer:~/scratch% R CMD check ./partitions_1.1-0.tar.gz
* checking for working latex ... OK
*[snip]

* checking examples ... OK
* checking tests ...
   Running 'aaa.R'
make[1]: *** [aaa.Rout] Error 1
make: *** [all] Error 2
ERROR

checking  aaa.Rout.fail, I get

Robin-Hankins-Computer:~/scratch% cat ./partitions.Rcheck/tests/
aaa.Rout.fail
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/bin/R: line 192: /Library/

anyone got any insight into this?

It looks like you should probably be installing into a user directory rather
than a system directory?  When you install, be sure that you check the
appropriate box.

Could you be, please, more specific? What package you are trying to  
load, what is your hardware etc.?

This is ok - the install script tries to apply more restrictive  
permissions to R.css - it is just a harmless warning.

Simon

My guess would be that you are working on a ppc machine, but for some  
reason you're trying to run a test with R_ARCH=/i386 (or R does). Can  
you send me the package, please?

Hi Simon,

Using OS 10.4.6 on a G4, I have reinstalled R2.3.0 with 3114 update  
but I still have the same problem when I try to install labdsv.   
Error message:

Didn't help.

Why don't you install the required packages? I think you should go to  
www.bioconductior.org and read how to install it. Do you have a  
specific reason why you try to build GOstats (there is no Gostats!!)  
from sources?

If you insist on doing this manually, you can use
install.packages(c("KEGG","GOstats"),,c("http://cran.r- 
project.org","http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/1.8/bioc","http:// 
www.bioconductor.org/packages/1.8/data/annotation"),dependencies=TRUE)

Also there is no makeGOGraphs function on GOstats, anyway, you should  
probably use makeGOGraph instead.

Did you use the R.mpkg? That should install everything as intended.  
Manual installation of individual packages is not tested and in fact  
fails.

Ok, thanks. This should be fixed now. make check didn't catch this,  
because it worked in the command-line version of R.
(use r.research.att.com repository or wait for next CRAN sync)

This is a hack! This is only necessary if you want to have multiple R  
versions on your machine in parallel! Be careful, using it for re- 
installation will break the update process, so use it only if you are  
sure you know what you're doing. (And R installation itself has  
nothing to do with labdsv).

Sokol,

I can't really tell if this is a cross-post from the bioc mailing list, or a
new post, so I'll start from the beginning.  In general, though, keep
bioconductor-specific questions to the bioconductor list; this makes
searching down the road much easier and makes sure to target the correct
audience for your questions.

To install bioconductor packages, read this page:

http://www.bioconductor.org/download/

What happens when you do what it says there?  After that, are you loading
the library using the library() command?  What happens when you do that?
And how are you invoking the makeGOgraph command?  Again, detail is
important.  Finally, a post to the email list really isn't complete without
including the output of sessionInfo() after you have loaded the appropriate
packages.

Message-ID: <0C83306D-1E8C-44D7-AA28-00C25C15F668@eva.mpg.de>

Dear all,


I found this thread about R 2.3.0 and rgl on OS X 10.4.6 in the  
internet.


I had the same problem. I fixed the source code for api.cpp in that way:

I only changed both lines with -> void rgl_win... ( ... , int* view)  
into void rgl_win... ( ... , GLint* view)

line ca. 597 rgl version 0.66
...
void rgl_user2window(int* successptr, int* idata, double* point,  
double* pixel, double* model, double* proj, GLint* view)
{
   int success = RGL_FAIL;
   GLdouble* vertex = pixel;
   int columns = idata[0];

   Device* device = deviceManager->getAnyDevice();

   if ( device ) {
   	for (int i=0; i<columns; i++) {
		gluProject(point[0],point[1],point[2],model,proj,view,
		vertex,vertex+1,vertex+2);
		vertex[0] /= view[2];
		vertex[1] /= view[3];
		point += 3;
		vertex += 3;
	}
	success = RGL_SUCCESS;
   }

   *successptr = success;
}

void rgl_window2user(int* successptr, int* idata, double* point,  
double* pixel, double* model, double* proj, GLint* view)
{
   int success = RGL_FAIL;
   GLdouble* vertex = point;
   int columns = idata[0];

   Device* device = deviceManager->getAnyDevice();

   if ( device ) {
   	for (int i=0; i<columns; i++) {
	        pixel[0] *= view[2];
	        pixel[1] *= view[3];
		gluUnProject(pixel[0],pixel[1],pixel[2],model,proj,view,
		vertex,vertex+1,vertex+2);
		pixel += 3;
		vertex += 3;
	}
	success = RGL_SUCCESS;
   }

   *successptr = success;
}

...


Then I recompiled this and everything works fine.


It is the first time I post something here and I don't know whether  
it is the right place but ...


All the best

So why didn't you use the fix?

That is a very bad hack and I don't recommend using it. The only  
reason it works is that in 32-bit mode gcc int and long have the same  
size. It will break horribly if compiled as 64-bit. I don't know if  
you actually looked at the reason, but GLint is defined as long - so  
in is NOT int! That is why the compiler is (correctly) complaining.

OK. I understand now why R.mpkg works and not R-Framework.pkg :-)

Not necessarly "any other version": powerpc/R-2.2.1.dmg and R-2.3.0-mini.dmg
won't coexist but they will _not_ touch my R 2.1.1 installation.

Thanks for the work-around. It works in the sense that after this removal,
powerpc/R-2.2.1.dmg will not delete my previous installation of R 2.3.0.
But after doing this, I'm still unable to launch R 2.3 from the command
line:

  dhcp157137:/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions compbio$ 
2.3/Resources/bin/R
  2.3/Resources/bin/R: line 166: 
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/etc/ppc/ldpaths: No such file 
or directory

The correct path for the 'ldpaths' file is indeed
  /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.3/Resources/etc/ppc/ldpaths
not
  /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/etc/ppc/ldpaths

After having a closer look at the 2.3/Resources/bin/R and 
2.2/Resources/bin/R
scripts, I found that they both try to access objects
under /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources but since, on my machine,
this is a symlink to the 2.2 installation (because I installed 2.2 
_after_ 2.3),
then 2.3 is trying to access 2.2 resources :-/

Do you have a work-around for that?

Thanks again for your help,

H.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Outdated links to the Bioconductor repos in R.app
Message-ID: <4473C571.80704@fhcrc.org>

Hi,

I'm using R.app GUI 1.16-pre (3114) with R 2.3.0.

The links defined in R.app for accessing the Bioconductor repositories
need to be updated.

They are currently defined as:

> getOption("BioC.Repos")
[1] "http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/bioc/stable"
[2] "http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/data/annotation/stable"
[3] "http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/data/experiment/stable"

but they should be (in this order):

   http://bioconductor.org/packages/bioc
   http://bioconductor.org/packages/data/annotation
   http://bioconductor.org/packages/data/experiment
   http://bioconductor.org/packages/omegahat
   http://bioconductor.org/packages/lindsey
   http://cran.fhcrc.org

Also, we have started to use a more consistent spelling for the
project ( it's never too late ;-) ): please help us by using "Bioconductor"
instead of "BioConductor".

Thanks!

H.

The default R_HOME is /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources and  
therefore the R script always starts the current framework. You can  
change the current framework by modifying the /Library/Frameworks/ 
R.framework/Versions/Current symlink. Lot of things rely on this  
symlink, so running R off a different version without changing this  
link is unsupported and may break. [My package building system  
actually installs a clean copy of R before building to make sure  
everything is ok, but that's my paranoia ;).]

For the record you can switch the R version e.g. to 2.3 using
sudo ln -sf /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/Current 2.3

make sure you really have a complete R 2.3.x installed as framework  
before you do that - check with
ls -l /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/

<kids don't do this at home - for experienced users only!!>
Nevertheless, if you take some care, you may run R regardless of the  
symlink in some circumstances. If you're talking about command-line  
version of R, it's actually easy, just change R_HOME in the R start  
script to point to the version-specific Resources directory. (You'll  
need separate scripts anyway, but $R_HOME/bin/R must always be  
correct and correspond to the $R_HOME).

If you want to run the GUI, you have to be more careful. First, you  
have to make sure that it is linked to the version-specific libR (see  
otool -L). If it's not, you'll have to change it (install_name_tool - 
change ...). Secondly, you have to make sure that R.app knows about  
the R_HOME. There are several ways to do it - probably the easiest is  
to add Info.plist with bundle identifier to the R framework, i.e. put  
something like this in Resources/Info.plist of each R framework (you  
may want change the version of course):

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http:// 
www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
         <key>CFBundleIdentifier</key>
         <string>org.r-project.R-framework</string>
         <key>CFBundleInfoDictionaryVersion</key>
         <string>6.0</string>
         <key>CFBundleName</key>
         <string>R</string>

Should CRAN be really on that list? This will list all packages, even  
non-Bioc ones in the package selection. Maybe it should be handled  
separately (e.g. added on installation, but omitted when available  
packages are listed?).

Lindsey was omitted intentionally, because the packages are  
constantly broken (0 of them compile on OS X to-date) and the  
maintainer refuses to fix them despite instructions how to do so.  
(His last response was that the users should fix it themselves...)

Oh, ok :). Are we allowed to use BioC or is it also Bioc? (The latter  
looks rather boring ;)).

Many Bioc packages depend on packages hosted on CRAN.  What is needed
is that _some_ CRAN repository be in the vector of repositories
specified by the 'repos' argument in calls to install.packages and
update.packages.  Otherwise, dependencies won't be installed.

If there is a way to handle this separately so that CRAN packages
don't come up in a Bioc listing, that seems like an improvement to me.

And to be clear, we've put our (FHCRC) CRAN mirror there not because
we think that is the best solution, but because it works.  A planned
improvement is to try and detect the current repos option and only add
if needed.

Hmm, I wonder if we need to have a vote on bioc-devel :-)

Simon,

Point taken. In the future, I'll try to base my reports on the last

Well it depends what you are trying to achieve: if you want the GUI
to show the user the list of Bioconductor packages only, then you
don't need the 3 last repos.
But if you also want the user to be able to install from this list and
then to load the newly installed stuff, then you need 2 things:

  1) provide a set of repos that is closed for the dependency relationship

  2) provide the user with the option to have all the dependencies
     installed in addition to the packages s/he selected

Since the GUI doesn't support 2), then I agree that we don't really
need the 3 last repos (omegahat, lindsey and CRAN)... But I'd rather
keep them anyway because:

  - Some users might want to do things like:
      install.packages('pkg', repos=getOption("BioC.Repos"), dep=TRUE)
    The only way to guarantee that this will work for _any_ Bioconductor
    package is to have all 5 repos returned by getOption("BioC.Repos")

The inconvenient of this is that we end up with the GUI displaying a very

Agreed :-), but OTOH, as Seth told me recently, "BioC" might suggest that
we are using C instead of R.
Anyway, let's stick to "BioC" for now...

Forgive, but if that's the case, why can't it be specified as such:

whole.enchilda.repos <- c(getOption("BioC.Repos"),
                         "http://bioconductor.org/packages/omegahat",
                         "http://cran.fhcrc.org")  # getOption("repos")?
install.packages('pkg', repos = whole.enchilda.repos, depend = TRUE)

>   - Things are consistent with the biocLite() function that we provide

Since the above would be an internal change to the install
script, the above would be even less effort.

I don't. There may be others as well... I'd rather BioC
packages be kept separate from CRAN packages in the
listing...

I second that. While I am indifferent to what goes on under the hood,  
the Gui (as it stands right now) should only list Bioconductor  
packages when selecting either "Bioconductor (sources)" or  
"Bioconductor (binaries)".

Simon,

Changing the symlink still doesn't really solve the issue because it 
only enables
one R installation at a time. What if I want to work simultaneously with 
R 2.3.0
in one terminal and with R 2.2.1 in another terminal? Or if I want to 
allow some
Bioconductor developper to remote loggin and either use R 2.3.0 or R 
2.4.0 at
the command line (R 2.3.0 to test the package he has in our release 
branch and
R 2.4.0 for the package he has in our devel branch)? Or if I want to setup
automated builds that use R 2.3.0 for packages in our release branch and
R 2.4.0 for packages in our devel branch?

I've also tried to compile and install R in a non standard place (by 
using the
--enable-framework option at configure time) then I can manage to have R 
2.3.0
and R 2.4.0 in 2 completely different frameworks, e.g. one under ~/2.3 
and one
under ~/2.4. This works in the sense that now I can start R 2.3.0 and R 
2.4.0
_simultaneouly_ (by using ~/2.3/R.framework/Resources/bin/R and
~/2.4/R.framework/Resources/bin/R respectively).
But is this really supported? I mean, how will this play with the 
installation and
loading of CRAN binary packages? Some of them are dynamically linked
against stuff found under /Library/Frameworks/R.framework. For example it
seems that XML_0.99-7.tgz (from CRAN) is dynamically linked to
  /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.3/Resources/lib/libR.dylib
How can I make this package work with my own R installed under ~/2.3?
It's OK if the answer is something like "it won't work, if you have 
compiled and
installed R in a non-standard place, then you must install packages from 
source" ;-)
No problem, I can do that... but then what about the binary packages I'm 
producing
myself? With my settup they will be linked against stuff under ~/2.3 or 
~/2.4 so
I can't distribute them anymore :-/

OK I realize that the topic is moving now to building binary packages 
issues so in
order to stick to the original problem, the question is:

  How can I have 2 installations of R that can be used simultaneously?

Thanks for your help,

H.

PS: And for my automated builds, I don't need to have R 2.3.0 and R 
2.4.0 on the
same machine anymore because I now have access to a 2nd machine for that 
(since
this morning) :-)

OK so ideally the GUI should use 2 sets of repos:

  - one for _displaying_ the list of Bioconductor packages:

      http://bioconductor.org/packages/bioc
      http://bioconductor.org/packages/data/annotation
      http://bioconductor.org/packages/data/experiment
      http://bioconductor.org/packages/omegahat
      http://bioconductor.org/packages/lindsey

    NB: Note that having omegahat and lindsey will help to prevent
    questions like "Hey my package xxx says it depends on SSOAP but
    I don't see SSOAP in the list and it's not in CRAN neither!".
    Having omegahat and lindsey adds less than 10 packages anyway...

  - one for _installing_ the selected packages:

      same as above + http://cran.fhcrc.org

And the installation should be done with 'dep=TRUE'.

Is that OK with you Mac OS X GUI maintainers?
Thanks in advance!

Best,

H.

OK thanks! That's exactly what I'm interested in, so before I bother you 
more
I'm going to try this and will come back here with my feedback...
Sorry for my last post. Please ignore it.

For display purposes in a listing that will be presented to users in
the GUI, it would make more sense to me to present three separate bioc
repository listings:
 Bioc software
 Bioc annotation
 Bioc experiment

The annotation repository contains 636 packages (!)
The experiment data repository is small, but expected to grow to the
100's of packages in the near future.

As of dep=TRUE - that is what the "install dependencies" checkbox is  
about. And yes, the above was my proposal and the responses seem to  
confirm it. I have now modified the PI such that the list will be  
based on "BioC.repos" and installation will add "repos" (revision 3178).

Of course you meant:

Message-ID: <40e66e0b0605250943s360c09b3l719ef84410f57eb5@mail.gmail.com>

I am unable to install or check the nlme package under OS X (Intel)
with R-2.3.0.  The transcript ends with

ERROR: compilation failed for package 'nlme'

after attempting to compile the arch - ppc.  It looks as if the
compilation for arch - i386 has succeeded.

I can provide more details if that would help.  This is rather
embarrassing because I was installing some bug fixes and now I can't
check them without going back to my trusty Linux machines.

Yes, the details are essential here :). Intel machines should be able  
to build universal packages.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] R performance on OS X and a suggestion
Message-ID: <17526.38233.638256.918694@musil.localdomain>


Hi,

I've spent a lot of time improving the performance of my 'Matching'
package on OS X (as has a generous programmer in the OS X Performance
group at Apple).  For this package (and it is not alone) there has
been a large performance gap between OS X and Linux.  Even after many
memory and algorithmic optimizations (using BLAS etc), it is still
important for performance to not use the default OS X malloc.  It
starts using the kernel's virtual memory manager for allocations
greater than 15kb while the latest version of dmalloc only uses mmap
for allocations greater than 256kb.

However, a Linux speed advantage remains which varies with the size of
the dataset used. But the performance gap is much greater if the
default OS X malloc is used notwithstanding the new
algorithm. Therefore, I recommend that R for OS X be linked against
dmalloc just as it is for Windows.

For details see:

http://sekhon.berkeley.edu/macosx/

The memory issue affects a number of packages.  For example, the
growing number which depend on the very useful Scythe Statistical
Library.

The latest version of 'Matching' which I've just uploaded to CRAN
links against dmalloc (but only when it is built for OS X).  A more
elegant solution would be for the R OS X build to do so directly.

Cheers,
Jas.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Saving a quart device file as a '.pdf'
Message-ID: <C09CC4DF.21EF%gardnerw@ccri.net>

Hi Friends,
I just upgraded to R.2.3.0 and R-GUI-3114-2.3. I am running Tiger on a
MacBook Pro. I am now unable to save a quartz device file with a .pdf
extension. The file dialogue insists that it be saved with an extension
'quartz device'. Perhaps for this reason, Word is not recognizing these
files as 'Pictures', nor does ADOBE Preview recognize these files as pdfs.
This means I have to copy and paste them as bitmaps into Word.

In the previous version of R I was able to save as pdf and Word could just
read the file directly.

Any thoughts?

Thanks


Bill

Hi Bill,

Have you tried changing the file extension to pdf?
I believe that this solved the issue for me.

Take care,

Message-ID: <40e66e0b0605271504m2dcb662enc9f358a51fdef921@mail.gmail.com>

I downloaded the universal nightly build of R-patched from
http://r.research.att.com/, which identifies itself as

Version 2.3.1 RC (2006-05-26 r38204)

After installing it on an Intel Mac I found that I couldn't run it
because it tried to dyld a library that wasn't present.  I played
around with removing and installing the gcc403 package a bit then
realized that it was a matter of the name and could be solved by
adding a symlink

cd /usr/local/gcc4.0
sudo mkdir i686-apple-darwin8
cd i686-apple-darwin8
sudo ln -s ../lib .

The problem is that the name /usr/local/gcc4.0/i686-apple-darwin/lib
is hardwired in the i686 executable but that directory is not
installed by the gcc403 package.

Installed R (2.4.0) on new dual-G5 Mac (OS X 10.4.4), on startup get  
the following errors involving inability to load grDevices (and then  
subsequently can't use graphics functions or any other packages that  
have graphics dependencies).  Have scanned earlier posts and the R

issues with library versioning, but am at a loss as to which  
libraries may need fixing, or how to fix them (the details of this  
case seem different from those examples).  Thanks in advance for your  
ideas:

Which version of the GUI are you using? Including your GUI version, R  
version and machine type in the post is critical for us to be of any  
help! This was fixed a while ago, so my guess is simply that your GUI  
is too old. Please test the most recent version (see http:// 
R.research.att.com/ ) and let us know in case it didn't go away.

Cheers,
Simon

Thanks, Doug.

In fact this is a bug in the nightly path fix-up, because the binary  
is not supposed to have any links to /usr/local/gcc4.0 as it is not  
required for running R. I have fixed it so the next build should be ok.

I'm glad that at least someone actually tests the beta/RC ..

Thanks,
Simon

Please  be more specific as how how you installed it. I have just  
tested the nightly binary and it doesn't show this behavior, so I  
have no idea where you installed it from.

At this point I can only speculate - the error below usually means  
that you are using an incompatible mix of compilers (gfortran that  
doesn't match the other gcc parts).

Just in case that doesn't help and you installed multiple versions of  
R - another hypothesis is that you may have the wrong version of R  
marked as current -
ls -l /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/Current
should be showing 2.4, otherwise you're in trouble. (For the record -  
there is no R 2.4.0 - only R-devel which is 2.4.0-to-be).

I installed R from the R-devel-tiger-universal.tar.gz.

I had the current problem with earlier versions of R (before R-devel)  
on this machine, though never on my OS 10.3.9 laptop.

Versions/Current is showing 2.4:

lrwxrwxrwx   1 smccarro  admin    3 May 27 17:55 Current -> 2.4

It turns out that I can't load most packages:

Please start R as follows and send me the output:

DYLD_PRINT_LIBRARIES=1 R

(you can just direct it to a file like  2> /tmp/foo >&2 but then  
you'll have to work "blind")

Did you install the gcc 4.0.3 from the R 2.3.0 CRAN installer?

Cheers,
Simon

Hi,

A user reported to me that the latest binary build of Matching (2.1-1,
built May 29) for R-2.3.0 does not load on his Intel Mac.  And after
some debugging, I ended up rediscovering a version of the issue which
Douglas Bates posted regarding the beta test build of R-2.3.1.

The problem is that the Intel OS X Matching library posted on CRAN
assumes that the libgcc_s.1.0.dylib library is located in
/usr/local/gcc4.0/i686-apple-darwin8/lib/ which is not where it is
installed by the default gcc package.  This problem does not occur
when I build Matching on my Intel Mac.

The following fixes the problem (the same fix as Doug pointed out):

cd /usr/local/gcc4.0
sudo mkdir i686-apple-darwin8
cd i686-apple-darwin8
sudo ln -s ../lib 

Otherwise, one gets the following error:

> library(Matching) 
Loading required package: MASS 
Loading required package: rgenoud 
Error in dyn.load(x, as.logical(local), as.logical(now)) :

  Referenced from:

  Reason: image not found

Cheers,

Your package bypasses the shlib building process and does not even  
link to libR. The fix-up code doesn't expect anything like that,  
because the consequence is that the `.so's don't contain the path to  
R and hence it is not possible to determine the correct path for the  
libraries (stdc++, gcc_s) that come shipped with R from the so itself.

Your package is the only one on CRAN with this issue. Although the  
behavior is legal, I would recommend rather using Makevars  
instead ;). For now I have fixed it manually and I'll see if I can  
get around the problem.

Cheers,
Simon

Simon,

Thanks.  If linking to libR would solve the issue, I can easily do
that.  Let me know.  If not, I guess I'll use Makevars for OS X.
However, there are two reasons why I don't currently use Makevars but
a legal Makefile generated by a configure script.  First, I don't want
to compile all of the files on all platform (for example, malloc.c is
only for OS X but OS X does not need a cblas wrapper).  Second, I want
to override the default CXXFLAGS and not simply prepend arguments to
it via PKG_CXXFLAGS.  For this package, aggressive optimization flags
are both safe and make a big difference.  Is it safe to assume that
all version of gcc will follow the first flag directive when
contradictory flags are given?  For example, if both -O3 and -O2 are
entered?  The Portland Group Compiler follows the last argument (-O2
in this case).  I guess this problem can be avoided for the default
install (which uses the "-g -O2" flags) by prepending the additional
optimizations implied by -O3.  That's what I do on Windows right now
(via Makevars.win).

Given the forgoing, creating my own Makefile by a configure script was
the easiest and most flexible thing to do.  I can easily get the
configure script to generate a Makevars file instead and get the
script to move source files around so everything remaining in the src
directory actually needs to be compiled on a given platform.  This
will cause R CMD check to complain about non portable compilation
flags in Makevars even though there is a configure script checking the
compiler.  But I assume that is a minor issue since you and Kurt could
ignore that warning for this package when posting to CRAN?

Cheers,
Jas.

Dear all -

Has anyone seen the discussion surrounding this?  They test they  
refer to uses R on Windows, Linux and OSX.  The upshot appears to be  
that building R against the Lea malloc on OSX, rather than the  
default ,makes for a more comparable result....

The benchmarks referred to in the article are a bit dated, but dmalloc
still makes the results more comparable (although a gap remains).  For
the current benchmarks see:

http://sekhon.berkeley.edu/macosx

I just had dinner last night with someone in Apple's Mac OS X
performance group, and the default malloc for 10.5 will be better
optimized for our purposes.  The BLAS implementation in the vecLib
Framework will also be significantly improved for x86.

Cheers,
Jas.
