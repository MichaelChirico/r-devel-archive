Agreed, no problem here even with Rcmdr in older R 4.2.0. As Peter said, Rcmdr doesn't use tcltk2 so I'm sure there is a lot you're omitting here. If it doubt, make sure you don't load some old workspace and have the latest versions of all packages, e.g. via update.packages(ask=FALSE).

Cheers,
Simon

Hello Simon,

Actually the Rcmdr *does* import (and use) the tcltk2 package, but I've 
had no other report of this kind of problem and haven't observed it myself.

Best,
  John

A possible clue.  tclrk2 on Linux used to do something very similar 
(including the infinite loop) if the X server had died but the DISPLAY 
variable was set.

So I would investigate the XQuartz installation, maybe starting with a 
precautionary re-install of the latest non-beta version (currently 
2.8.5).  Then check package tcltk works correctly.

Hello ! 

Many thanks for your answers. I found a way to open Rcmdr maybe it can help if someone has an issue with that. I had to open R with the Xquartz?s terminal it?s weird because it wasn?t like that some months ago ? 

Thanks again 

Sabrina

That makes me wonder if something untoward is in your .login, .bashrc, 
or similar startup files invoked by Terminal.

Dear Simon,

Thanks for your reply, much appreciated. My question is precisely how I can
reproduce the CRAN test results (which all pass) for the Mac build of mmrm
0.2.2.
I can't with Macbuilder, and I can't locally.

My understanding from reading the Writing R extensions section is that
there might well be problems when using different compilers for R itself
and the R packages for compilation on Mac. This is the situation I have on
Macbuilder and locally, but also on CRAN. I am not sure though it would be
worthwhile to try debug the test failures on Macbuilder and locally, when
all tests pass on CRAN, and on Windows and Linux platforms.

Any additional tips would be appreciated,

best regards
Daniel

Thank you, that is good to know. It could be interesting to learn from the
fixes of these R packages, do you maybe have a list of the package names
already which you could share?

Packages should aim to be platform-independent. So rather than expect

Fully agree, generally we aim to be compatible with all CRAN tested
systems. In particular for Mac I am quite new to the different combinations
of R itself and packages being compiled, which compiler versions can be
combined etc.

Thanks, I will also test the 'development' toolchain and see what happens.

It is possible to download different CLTs from

Thank you, that is very helpful!

Thank you, that is very helpful!

R Version for Mac (Intel)  R-4.3.1-x86_64.pkg<https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/macosx/big-sur-x86_64/base/R-4.3.1-x86_64.pkg> installed on OS Monterey 12.6.8, 2.5 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7

Can you help, see below!

I thinks that looks like normal behaviour to me.

The stop button would be used to interrupt a long-running computation to get your prompt back. The function button is active earn you are creating a function in the editor.

You can?t stop something that isn?t going. Try

x <-0
for (i in 1:1000000000) x <- x+1
