David,

thanks for your report. The package index file PACKAGES is missing in the binary repository for R 3.6.x due to a sync issue yesterday (the build machine was relocated yesterday). This has been fixed now, but it may take CRAN mirrors some time before the change propagates, so please use the master
https://mac.R-project.org
as the CRAN mirror until it does.

Thanks,
Simon

Hi,

I'm a R newbie having some problems.

The special PACKAGES file seems to be missing for version 3.6:
https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/macosx/el-capitan/contrib/3.6/PACKAGES

This is causing install.packages() to fail, which forces installation from source:

> install.packages("tidyverse")
also installing the dependencies ?sys?, ?ps?, ?markdown?, ?askpass?, ?processx?, ?knitr?, ?yaml?, ?htmltools?, ?base64enc?, ?curl?, ?mime?, ?openssl?, ?callr?, ?fs?, ?rmarkdown?, ?haven?, ?httr?, ?jsonlite?, ?readxl?, ?reprex?, ?rvest?, ?xml2?

Warning: unable to access index for repository https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/macosx/el-capitan/contrib/3.6:
 cannot open URL 'https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/macosx/el-capitan/contrib/3.6/PACKAGES'
Packages which are only available in source form, and may need
 compilation of C/C++/Fortran: ?sys? ?ps? ?markdown? ?askpass?
 ?processx? ?yaml? ?htmltools? ?base64enc? ?curl? ?mime? ?openssl?
 ?fs? ?haven? ?jsonlite? ?readxl? ?xml2?
Do you want to attempt to install these from sources? (Yes/no/cancel)

Have I made som mistake or is this a real problem?

Many thanks for any help.

Best regards,

Joel Jacobson

Joel,

This should be a temporary issue, I can reach the failed URL.

	local({
	+   r <- getOption("repos")
	+   r["CRAN"] <- "https://cloud.r-project.org/"
	+   options(repos = r)
	+ })

	> install.packages("tidyverse")
	[...]
	trying URL 'https://cloud.r-project.org/src/contrib/tidyverse_1.3.0.tar.gz'
	Content type 'application/x-gzip' length 712837 bytes (696 KB)
	[...]

Did an upgrade (of packages) from within RStudio from same and that also
worked out well.

So, in the first instance, try again :-)-O

CRAN has many mirrors, but I strongly advise for using RStudio which
figures this out for themselves in addition to many other advantages
(such as sponsoring the mirroring service in the first place), so you
could try the closest mirror from https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html.

greetings, el

R Studio sponsors cloud.... but not all mirrors.

For myself, I would not use RStudio as it does what you describe: Lots 
of things I do not want to be done. So I typically never give advise 
which editor or environment to use, as that is a matter of taste.

Best,
Uwe Ligges

You didn't give any advice. I did :-)-O And it does what the OP asked 
for :-)-O

I do some things in the command line R or even running stuff as Rscript,
but for development (and updates) an IDE such as RStudio is very helpful
even if it is not die reine Lehre :-)-O

The file was missing for sure from all mirrors also the main one. My guess is you have a cronjob that builds the new PACKAGES file that removes the old file before the new one has been created.

Best regards,

Joel

Note that the mirrors do not sync at the same time. So even if the 
PACKAGES file was missing for few seconds or even minutes, it ios very 
unlikely that all mirrors lost it, too.

Thanks, indeed, there were some disruptions, but now the build machine has its own dedicated port and location in Auckland so hopefully things will settle.
I have also fortified the sync scripts to not sync with the Mac master if there is no PACKAGES file to avoid such issues in case something goes wrong.
That said, the issue should be resolved now - please use
https://mac.R-project.org
as the mirror for mac binaries until all mirrors catch up.

Cheers,
Simon

Thanks, that's great news.

Minor note: the server no longer allows for directory listing, is this
on purpose? E.g.
https://mac.r-project.org/bin/macosx/el-capitan/contrib/3.6/ . It's
sometimes useful to be able to see what is on the server, e.g. to see
the timestamps or file sizes of the packages.

I kept getting bug bounties on the server since open directory listing are considered unsafe. For some parts we have a generated index files (e.g., /src and /libs), but not everywhere. I'll see if white-listing some locations would fly.

Thanks,
Simon

The link https://mac.r-project.org/bin/macosx/R-latest.pkg which
previously served the latest version of R is now returning a 403. Is
this an intentional change, or is it an unintentional? This link is
used by the Travis-CI build scripts for macOS, so if the link is no

Hi,

I am experimenting since some days to find the ?best? compiler toolchain for R-devel to get R-devel package source installs on the new macOS Github Actions runners work in a somewhat stable way.
I am also on macOS locally which I use for testing as well.

I am aware of?https://github.com/rmacoslib/r-macos-rtools. However, using clang7 for all (CC, CXX, etc) leads to some packages failing to build (sometimes due to missing OpenMP capabilities, sometimes undefined).

Therefore I decided to try out gcc (v8 and v9). While this solves most of the OpenMP issues, I am running into problems for other packages regarding CC compilation.

Turns out that using any clang version for CC solves most problems but not all.
However then I have a mix of gcc and clang which is most likely cause other issues.

Currently Jeroen is developing a new gcc8 based toolchain for Windows.

I was reading the macOS CRAN dev pages but could not find any reasoning why

? clang7 is suggested
? gcc is not used
? What future plans are there for the toolchain on macOS

Could someone shine some light on this? Thanks :)

Cheers, Patrick

Hey Patrick,

i had the same issue /problem on my MAC.
First of all you need from Apple XCODE the Command-Line. 

I find here a good instruction to do that:
https://wiki.helsinki.fi/display/HUGG/GNU+compiler+install+on+Mac+OS+X

But, I?m not sure if you can compile the GNU-C 9.x - Version.
Try it and if you have found out, how - please let me know.

Best regards?.

Matthias,

Thanks for your reply.

My questions was not about how to install gcc on macOS - this is very simple using homebrew (brew install gcc). Also I am familiar with the xcode basics and so on.
Homebrew is the de-facto standard package manager on macOS - mentioning it again explicitly because I remember from one of your last posts that you were not familiar with it.

My question was rather about the reasoning for the current toolchain of CC and friends on macOS and if there could be more robust settings than using clang7.

Cheers

Simon has recently brought up (on R-core) the related issue of what to use as the target platform for 4.0.0. 

I don't know whether he is ready to take his deliberations to a wider audience at this point.

All,

First, macos-rtools isn't an officially sanctioned R project installer. I created it in the Summer of 2017 to quickly get students and collaborators setup with minimal effort under a configuration that mirrored CRAN. This was primarily due to the lack of official installer packages and students not being able to modify the PATH variable correctly. 

Having said this, the setup mirrored is given in section C.3.2. of the R Installation and Administration manual:
https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-admin.html#Recommended-C_002fC_002b_002b-compilers 

I believe you are referring to this section.

From working with the toolchain for a while, the short version of why clang is "recommended" over gcc is because there are two different implementations of the C++ standard library at play: 

- libc++: developed for clang courtesy of Apple and its crusade against GPL
- libstdc++: developed for gcc. 

Both libraries can be dropped in, but sometimes do not produce equivalent results.

So, mixing compilers based off of different versions leads to problems. This is why the compatibility issue exists between CRAN and Homebrew variants of R. e.g. 

CRAN Binary for macOS: clang + libc++
Homebrew variant: gcc + libstdc++

So, for everyday users sake, it's best to not switch out the underlying compiler as it mandates R packages are compiled from source instead of getting a binary from CRAN.

Best,

JJB

@Simon

As of today the link still returns a 403 - other R versions work.
Could you have a look? Especially because the Travis CI runner by Jim relies on it, this is somewhat pressing.

Thanks.

Aye. It's working fine from more than a few vantage points I've tested
it from via personal internet endpoints and work systems.

I've setup a daily 0500 ET cron job to do a HEAD of said URL and
output a slice of the {httr} response object as JSON to:
https://rud.is/dl/r-latest.json in the event other folks have issues
and need a validation point from a third party.

I've also got a local (not internet-facing) script that monitors the
mirror status (separate from what CRAN does as it's just looking for
last-modified date of src/contrib/PACKAGES,
bin/windows/contrib/3.6/PACKAGES, and
bin/macosx/el-capitan/contrib/3.6/PACKAGES on all HTTPS CRAN mirrors).
It's not internet-facing since I use it to check my own internal CRAN
mirror but I can also make a public JSON endpoint for it as well if
that wld be helpful for folks.

Simon, sorry I was wrong with the version.
In fact, I am getting a 403 with the R-3.6 branch.?Other branches work fine.

curl -Osv http://mac.r-project.org/el-capitan/R-3.6-branch/R-3.6-branch-el-capitan-sa-x86_64.tar.gz ? I

Same here. Signed version is fine, though.

Hey Simon (et al),

I setup a 2x daily link checker job for mac.r-project.org. It outputs tabular results to https://rud.is/mac-r-project-links/ (timestamp at top is when the job ran). One table is for HTTP HEAD results and the other is for HTTPS HEAD results since the server doesn't auto-upgrade HTTP to HTTPS which could mean different status codes depending the underlying config.

It's also configured to send me a pushover notification for anything but 200 return status code an I'll post here or privately when you give me the go-ahead to do that (since it cld take a bit to fix the below :-).

Right now, the following links have non-200 status codes:

- 404 http://mac.r-project.org/mavericks/R-3.4-branch/R-3.4-branch-mavericks-signed.pkg
- 404 http://mac.r-project.org/RSwitch-1.1.dmg
- 404 http://mac.r-project.org/RSwitch-1.2.tar.gz
- 404 http://mac.r-project.org/RSwitch-1.1.tar.gz
- 403 http://mac.r-project.org/el-capitan/R-3.6-branch/R-3.6-branch-el-capitan-sa-x86_64.tar.gz

Lemme know if I can do any more monitoring/alerting for the site.

Just a list FYI I'm keeping the status site up (https://rud.is/mac-r-project-links/) but since the current, remaining broken links aren't getting fixed I'm disabling Pushover notifications to me so I won't be able to proactively notify here if more links go bad.
