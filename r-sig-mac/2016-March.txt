Is there a way that does not involve a lot of time (because it is a purely cosmetic issue) to turn the Mac R GUI in the Monokai color scheme?

R...
Preferences...
Console Color wheel...

I've tried to set mine to solarized dark and they're reasonably close
and easier on the eyes. You have to set each color manually. The
Syntax color wheel is for the editor window. The only issue I've had
is that when you paste code from a webpage it carries with it
background and text colors until you save, reload.

I got the colors from here for Solarized: http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized

It would be nice to have a way to load a "theme" of colors for the
console and Syntax. Like you can in BBedit/TextWrangler or Xcode.

That?s a ?my eye? match, and more bother than I am prepared to put in.

or RStudio (which has a much worse graphical engine for complex plots, so I try to avoid it).

It's not really an eye match if you have the hex code or RGB for the
colors that you want, just click on the color and you can type in
exactly what you want. I agree, it's a little more work than it could
be. That being said, I wouldn't know how to implement a theming system
for it so I'm not much use to Simon et al. It would be an attractive
option to have though.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Pasting Code in Editor has Wrong Colors
Message-ID: <CAG2OMvt3KYs5OdN7fpGrNrvJvfvEjeHs=e3f0uTt_+ee+KKeJQ@mail.gmail.com>

As mentioned in the exchange with Frederico, I've been using Solarized Dark
colors for the console and editor to hopefully make long days of coding
easier on my eyes.

The issue is when I paste code from a webpage or email it appears to revert
to the original colors interspersed with the new background color. See this
image for an example: http://i.imgur.com/4n32Hx9.png

If I save the script and reload it, everything looks the way it should.
When the same code is pasted into R-GUI, everything is as it should be.

Thanks,
Brandon

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] building R with external Lapack
Message-ID: <CANLFJPrMNYMMCLcfx7s-rm5VStTF7h40NirHt5=a0FA5rgHbCg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list,

I have a package using RcppArmadillo for linear algebra; at some point in
the calculation it solves a linear system. I understand the c++ Armadillo
library hands this operation over to Lapack  Unfortunately, somewhere in my
toolchain Armadillo has been configured to use R's internal subset
of Lapack, which triggers the following warning every time I call the R
function,

warning: solve(): refinement and/or equilibration not done due to crippled
LAPACK

This doesn't sound very good, and is also a real nuisance in the terminal
as I'm calling the function hundreds of times in a loop. I've installed the
latest build from https://r.research.att.com, built and installed the
latest version of RcppArmadillo, but the problem persists.

I'm not sure if it's relevant to this question, but I've had some success
with the related issue of switching from R's internal BLAS to the vecLib
one,

cd /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/lib
ln -sf
/System/Library/Frameworks/Accelerate.framework/Frameworks/vecLib.framework/Versions/Current/libBLAS.dylib
libRblas.dylib

giving me a considerable boost in performance. I'm not sure if something
similar can be done for Lapack.

The next step I've taken was to try and build R myself, with explicit flags
telling R to use an external Lapack from Apple's Accelerate (vecLib?)
framework. I have not had any luck with that, every time some kind of error
appears, and I could not find a recent tutorial with step-by-step
instructions to build R on a Mac.

I've downloaded the R source, followed by

./configure SHELL='/bin/bash' r_arch=x86_64 CC="gcc -arch x86_64
-std=gnu99" CXX="g++ -arch x86_64" OBJC="gcc -arch x86_64" F77="gfortran
-arch x86_64" FC="gfortran -arch x86_64" --with-system-zlib
--with-blas='-framework vecLib' --with-lapack

with this summary at the end:

I've tried quite a few variations, but I'm shooting in the dark since I
don't understand the issue. If I've missed a standard tutorial, please let
me know.

Hmm, there was _something_ at _some_ point, on El Cap, I seem to remember. 

Have you tried the daily versions at http://r.research.att.com ?

Have you made sure that there is no hidden corrupt .Rdata  or .Rapp.history file? One way to do this is running R from a Terminal session with:

R --vanilla

I'm not a regular RStudio user, so If R is stable in that situation then your first act should be deleting those (invisible-by-default) files. It's fairly easy to find advice about how to make invisible files visible on OSX using a Google search. I'm not a regular RStudio user, so I don't know if finding such files in that environment is any more difficult. I suspect there would be such a file for every project.

Hi again,

Following my previous message, I've made some progress after finding hints
on the list archives that the flag CPPFLAGS="-D__ACCELERATE__"  should help
direct R to use the Accelerate framework. It does help in this regard, as
./configure now confirms,

  External libraries:        readline, BLAS(Accelerate), LAPACK(in blas),
zlib, bzlib, PCRE, curl

Unfortunately, make fails because of a missing lzma.h, even though it
exists and lives in /usr/local/include/lzma.h. I have xz installed via brew.

Ideally I would like to be able to build R from source on my mac, but that
has proved harder than I anticipated. Alternatively,

- is there a way to redirect R's Lapack after installation, the same way as
for BLAS?
( as in
cd /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/lib
ln -sf
/System/Library/Frameworks/Accelerate.framework/Frameworks/vecLib.framework/Versions/Current/libBLAS.dylib
libRblas.dylib)

- could I somehow silence RcppArmadillo's solve() warning? (this is more of
a Rcpp-dev question, I'll ask there if it comes to that)

Thanks,

baptiste

FWIW the colors are stored in 
~/Library/Preferences/org.R-project.R.plist
along with all other settings, so if you post that you can share your settings with others. It would certainly be doable to split off the colors piece into a separate file so you can load/save themes. As always, most work would go into creating a GUI to select themes, but simple load/save would be reasonably easy to add.

Cheers,
Simon

The paste option supports pasting attributes, so I wonder what is your source. If the source includes colors, the the source colors override your GUI setting - that is a standard Mac behavior (for better or worse). If you don't want that to happen, use "Paste as plain text" instead (<cmd><alt><V>)

Simon,

Thanks for the shortcut keys. I'll definitely use them.

As for your question about where it's coming from, mostly Chrome via
ggplot2/manipulatr mailing lists, and stackoverflow. As you say it will
retain the fonts and sizes and everything. I had tried CMD + Shift + V as
it is in gmail and it didn't work.

Coming from a naive standpoint, I'm unsure why pasting as plain text isn't
the default here. Is it inherited from OSX, and you have no choice?

I've thought about it a few times and I can't imagine why having decorated
text is useful in R-GUI at all but particularly the editor window. It
overrides colors, fonts, font sizes, until you save and reopen. Then
everything is like if you had pasted as plain text.

Thanks,
Brandon

Message-ID: <BD196694-C418-4150-B2B5-136BE2FF05B1@bio.umass.edu>

The major issue I have found with using cut-and-paste of R-scripts  or lines from Email is the quotes which often use symetrical quotes rather than the appropriate identical quote symbol.

You can cut and paste but edit the quotes to be the appropriate R-quote symbol and most of the time that works.

I am not sure that simply using plain-text helps the issue ? it is the symetry of the quote symbol that creates the problem.

Ok, small, but important, further update.

When you paste something as plain text in the editor, it does in fact
work, but my mistake was that I pasted as normal first and then tried
to paste as plain second. It was still using the colors of the
previous paste.

Sorry for the noise, it does work.

Thanks for the tip Henry, but that still doesn't do it for me.

mdfind finds quite a few options:





*/usr/local/Cellar/curl/7.47.1/lib/libcurl.4.dylib/usr/lib/libcurl.4.dylib/Users/dk/anaconda/pkgs/curl-7.45.0-0/lib/libcurl.4.dylib/Users/dk/anaconda/pkgs/curl-7.45.0-0/info/files/Users/dk/anaconda/pkgs/curl-7.38.0-0/lib/libcurl.4.dylib/Users/dk/anaconda/pkgs/curl-7.38.0-0/info/files*

I've tried adding each of these lib paths to my LD_LIBRARY_PATH, but it's
still not finding it from within R.

Hi,

Did you folks re-install R (and XQuartz) after upgrading to El Capitan?

As per the R Installation and Administration manual:

https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-admin.html#Installing-R-under-OS-X

"If you update your OS X version, you should re-install R (and perhaps XQuartz): the installer tailors the installation to the current version of the OS."


I am running El Capitan with R 3.2.3 and although I don't use the default GUI (I use ESS), I can run the GUI and get help files without issue.

Regards,

Marc Schwartz

Apropos: Notice that the latest broad-ranging security issue for OSX involves the Sparkle upgrade architecture used by XQuartz. For now, be careful no to update XQuartz over insecure connections (open WiFi, etc.)

This is just a guess, ... did you install that version of R through MacPorts? The most recent version of OSX has nailed down a lot of system folders to which write access used to be available.

You should use the binary installer package to update to the current version of R. Then your .libPaths() result should be:

[1] "/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.2/Resources/library"

You can then add  "/Users/iryna/Library/R/3.2/library" with:

 .libPaths(c("/Users/iryna/Library/R/3.2/library", .libPaths() ) ) 

, then copy old packages from your libraries, 
 and run (from the R console):  update.packages(checkBuilt=TRUE)

Half way through a week-long 130-person modelling workshop where all the students are using R, and I am reminded how nice R.app is, but also of a couple of niggles, which I thought I?d pass on.

1. The tab-completion drop-down doesn?t adjust it?s location to ensure the bottom coordinate of the dropdown menu is on screen, RStudio handles this correctly. I guess the algorithm is something like 

             dropdown.top.y = carat.y + max(0, dropdown.height - (screen.bottom - window.bottom.y))

2. The function status-bar parameter list is still fixed in a tiny font - should just take the main console font size and resize the status bar to suit.

3. For some reason whenever I type ??foo? and then tab complete, I get an extra question mark added, so 

?foo ?
??foo_bar

which does a global search

Best, tim

Dear Mac useRs,

Since this morning, I regularly get this message in the console:
"2016-03-14 11:25:58.004 R[656:707] Unknown class '_FITagEditorView', 
using 'NSView' instead. Encountered in Interface Builder file at path 
/System/Library/Frameworks/AppKit.framework/Resources/French.lproj/NSNavPanelContentView.nib."

I cannot give any trigger because it comes randomly. It seems that it 
does not prevent R from working, but I'm wondering whether this is a 
known issue.
Any idea what this could be? It seems that this might not be an R 
problem by itself but I don't really know what this "Framework" is about.

Yes, this is a known bug in Mavericks, a spurious error message form the system. Most apps don't forward stderr to the user and just put it in the logs, so you don't see it for other apps, but we forward stderr in case you run something you care about.

If you want to disable stderr forwarding because it bothers you,you can do so - see
http://r.research.att.com/bin/macosx/RMacOSX-FAQ.html#I-see-spurious-error-messages-when-starting-R_0021

Just note that you then won't see stderr form commands you start via system().

Cheers,
Simon

There used to be an innocuous system warning message that appearing at startup of R.app with the phrase something along the lines of "links to system flippers not found". I found it amusing to be starting up a software package that thought it needed pinball facilities. 

Anyone know of an R package that displays a simulated Pinball or old-style Pachinko machine?

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Installing source package/altering fortran location
Message-ID: <56E9B7AD.5070905@oracle.com>

I'm trying to install a source package (therefore needing compilation) 
under the R-3.2.4 Mac binary release. I happen to be using fortran 4.9.2 
on this machine and 
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/etc/Makeconf is bound to 4.8. 
I followed the instructions in R Installation and Administration to 
change this with no success so far. FWIW it's the actuar package I am 
trying to install.

First the .R/Makevars-R_PLATFORM file had no effect as seen from the 
package install log. Neither did setting R_MAKEVARS_USER. So I edited 
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/etc/Makeconf. It now looks 
right but clang still cannot find lgfortran:

Mick,

you're using Homebrew's gfortran, so you're pretty much on your own, because that's not what CRAN R was compiled with so it won't work. Since Homebrew messes with /usr/local (unless you tell it not to and install is elsewhere - which is a actually a good idea) it may be easier to just completely move it aside and just install the CRAN complier from
http://r.research.att.com/libs/gfortran-4.8.2-darwin13.tar.bz2

The other alternative is to use Homebrew entirely, including R, but then you have to install all packages from sources and/or through Homebrew. You can't mix CRAN and Homebrew because CRAN uses native libraries while Homebrew uses its own (incompatible) world.

Cheers,
Simon

Yes, I am beginning to question the sanity of using either HomeBrew or 
Macports (we had a LIB_ICONV problem yesterday due to a separate 
Macports install).

However, in this case, my problem was typo. I forgot the -L on the 
second library. With that it does link. Not sure why the .R/Makevars 
override didn't work but that's ok.

The real problem I am trying to resolve (and why I wanted to look at the 
GnuR installed library) is why in FastR we can't resolve the libRlapack 
or libRblas libraries when loading the actuar (and other) packages. This 
is all fallout from the El Cap decision to neuter DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH 
which we used to use and still do on Linux. otool -L on the GnuR 
installed library shows absolute paths for these libs referencing 
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework, which I assume comes from these options 
I see from the install: -L/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/lib 
-lRlapack, i.e:

otool -L $R_LIBS_USER/actuar/libs/actuar.so
/Users/mjj/R_libs_gnur/actuar/libs/actuar.so:
     actuar.so (compatibility version 0.0.0, current version 0.0.0)
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.2/Resources/lib/libRlapack.dylib 
(compatibility version 3.2.0, current version 3.2.4)
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.2/Resources/lib/libRblas.dylib (compatibility 
version 0.0.0, current version 0.0.0)
     /usr/local/opt/gcc/lib/gcc/4.9/libgfortran.3.dylib (compatibility 
version 4.0.0, current version 4.0.0)
     /usr/local/opt/gcc/lib/gcc/4.9/libquadmath.0.dylib (compatibility 
version 1.0.0, current version 1.0.0)
     /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current 
version 1226.10.1)
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.2/Resources/lib/libR.dylib 
(compatibility version 3.2.0, current version 3.2.4)
/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreFoundation.framework/Versions/A/CoreFoundation 
(compatibility version 150.0.0, current version 1256.14.0)
b

FastR passes what I consider equivalent options, e.g: 
-L/Users/mjj/ews/fastr_dev_home/fastr/lib -lRlapack

However, otool -L on the resulting library shows only a relative path, i.e:

otool -L ~/tmp/libtmp2/actuar/libs/actuar.so
/Users/mjj/tmp/libtmp2/actuar/libs/actuar.so:
     actuar.so (compatibility version 0.0.0, current version 0.0.0)
     libRlapack.dylib (compatibility version 3.2.0, current version 3.2.4)
     libRblas.dylib (compatibility version 0.0.0, current version 0.0.0)
     /usr/local/opt/gcc/lib/gcc/4.9/libgfortran.3.dylib (compatibility 
version 4.0.0, current version 4.0.0)
     /usr/local/opt/gcc/lib/gcc/4.9/libquadmath.0.dylib (compatibility 
version 1.0.0, current version 1.0.0)
     /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current 
version 1226.10.1)

So it seems as if the -L option is not having the effect I expect, which 
begs the question as to what does produce the absolute path in GnuR? Is 
it it somehow related to the framework args?

Evidently this is related to the "install name" of the shared library, 
which can be seen with otool -D, vis:

otool -D 
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.2/Resources/lib/libR.dylib
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.2/Resources/lib/libR.dylib:
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.2/Resources/lib/libR.dylib

whereas:

otool -D lib/libRblas.dylib
otool -D lib/libRblas.dylib
lib/libRblas.dylib:
libRblas.dylib

So, I need to use install_name_tool to update the path to an absolute 
path, after 'installing" it in lib.

Mick,

the linked path is governed by the library itself - in particular the ID entry of it. So, for example, R's libraries have:

$ otool -L /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/lib/libRblas.dylib
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/lib/libRblas.dylib:
	/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.2/Resources/lib/libRblas.dylib (compatibility version 0.0.0, current version 0.0.0)
	/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.2/Resources/lib/libgfortran.3.dylib (compatibility version 4.0.0, current version 4.0.0)
	/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.2/Resources/lib/libquadmath.0.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.0.0)
	/usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1197.1.1)

Note the first line - that is the ID line. When you link against that binary, that's what the resulting binary will refer to. I bet the FastR binary doesn't have the correct ID - you can fix it using 

install_name_tool -id <id-entry> <library>

so the above would be

install_name_tool -id /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.2/Resources/lib/libRblas.dylib /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.2/Resources/lib/libRblas.dylib

There a some projects that are clueless about OS X and require DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH because they don't set the id correctly. That is a bug in the library, you should never set DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH because it breaks the search path very badly (it is NOT the same as LD_LIBRARY_PATH on unix which people confuse a lot). A little more sane way is to use DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH which is more akin to LD_LIBRARY_PATH on Linux, but only as a last resort.

Cheers,
Simon

Thanks, our mails crossed, but I appreciate the explanation. It was a 
typo on DYLD. We did use to set the DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH but we 
don't any more as it doesn't work on El Cap with shells in the path.

I was actually using install_name_tool -change in our build of the 
stats.so to patch up the refs to lapack and blas. Now I can nuke that as 
the id change will now get it right.

I recall we re-export DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH in cases where it's needed - e.g. rJava uses in configure:

 DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH=`"${RBIN}" --slave --vanilla -e 'cat(Sys.getenv("DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH"))'`
 export DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH

R for Mac OS X GUI 1.67-devel Mavericks build

R for Mac OS X GUI written by:
Simon Urbanek
Hans-J?rg Bibiko
Stefano M. Iacus

I installed R in my MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Early 2013).  I have been using R since mid 2000s and started using the OS X GUI fairly early in my R experience and value its organization of my R use.

About a year ago I started having interuptions in my R-GUI use where it locks up.  All of several past interactions on the R-SIG-MAC so far have not eliminated this locking up.  In the latest go-around it was terminated with the idea that it was related to my use of large data sets and long calculations particularly ones that also used the rgl library.

As part of the drama of R Mac OS X GUI locking up, which has not been resolved for me yet, I now discovered new clues in the past month during which I have not used rgl.

1) When I boot R-GUI anew  the File/Open Recent has no entries.
    ? if I do a carriage-return at the R prompt the File/Open Recent list is populated.
2) The history for the active workspace has not been working for me.  It only loads the history that was collected in some earlier work directory. It does not save the current history in either an older directory or the (currently set in R/Preferences/General/Startup/Directory[x]Always_apply) current work directory .
3) When I try to save the current history using the > savehistory(file = ".Rhistory?) or simply  > savehistory() ? I get the following message:

######

 > savehistory(file = ".Rhistory?)
Error in .External2(C_savehistory, file) :
  'savehistory' is not currently implemented

#####

I have only made changes to R operation through R-GUI Preferences.  Is there something going wrong with the history functions in the GUI?

Work is slowed by lack of a useful history and continued need to reboot R in a complicated way each time the GUI locks up.

When I run R in a terminal at my home directory,  history works as advertised after I have done some work and q() with a save ? then reboot R in terminal and use up-arrow to retrieve old R statements.

4) I reiterate the tedious procedure for rebooting after a lock-up of GUI typically with a few R-scripts open in editors:
 a) kill the R process ID
 b) reboot the R-GUI, which by default loads the previously open R-scripts.
 c) close those R-scripts and do not do any R-work.
 d) quit()
 e) reboot the R-GUI and close it immediately with another q() {otherwise go back to step ?a?.}
 f) reboot the R-GUI and resume R-work {with no history ? as usual} e.g. load a script into the editor, edit and run it.  But, avoid trying to load another R-script into the ediitor after having run the one script.
     ? The scripts used are what I would call regular scripts accessing relatively small data sets and plotting results and _not_ using the difficult rgl library.

I am not sure how many other users are experiencing the same symptoms.

Joe

On a machine running the binary install version of R on OSX, the Mac OSX FAQ regarding this issue is at: 

file:///Applications/R.app/Contents/Resources/RMacOSX-FAQ.html#History

The default location for history files accrued while in R.app is .Rapp.history stored in the Starup directory.

And you are told: "Note that the functions loadhistory(), savehistory() and hence history() are not currently supported in R.app."

I'm pretty dang sure there's nothing in R, so go ahead and write one
:-). 

For the record: I own the games written by 'Champie' under the Pro
Pinball name. They are great. 

The best games currently sold are the Pinball Arcade series -- engine is
free, each table is $5, or less in bulk. 

Trust me -- you don't want to try to write your own engine and
game-builder. Check out VisualPinball/PinMame or FuturePinball if you
want to see how difficult it is. 

OT warning! ---> 

 I would absolutely love to get my hands on an EM JokerPoker . Anyone
have one for sale?
