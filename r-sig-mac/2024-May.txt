Carl,

it shows that you apparently had some ancient version of magrittr installed way back from R 4.2.x. I have no idea why or how you got it, but update.packages(checkBuilt=TRUE) in R 4.4.0 should have fixed it.

Cheers,
Simon

Seems like going to the "URL:" entry in the DESCRIPTION file would be 
the obvious first place to try.

You need to explain what particular part of running it doesn?t work. I?ve installed it on my M1 MacBook together with the extra packages in the Getting Started document, tried a simple example and everything works fine.  If you look at their website https://quanteda.io <https://quanteda.io/> it has a section Replications which shows how it can be used to perform some analyses from books.

Message-ID: <AC82F460-09A0-455F-A921-270763F0100D@math.uni-augsburg.de>

I have recently updated my Mac to R 4.4.0 and the latest version of RStudio.  This may or may not be the reason that any Rmd files of mine with citations fail with the following error on knitting to pdf:

! Undefined control sequence.
l.98 \NewDocumentCommand
                        \citeproctext{}{} 

Error: LaTeX failed to compile citeTest.tex.

Knitting to html or to word work fine.  Knitting to pdf without citations works as well.  Does anyone have a solution?

As a test file I have used the sample Rmd file from Posit with one citation added.

Thanks for any help

Hi Antony,

The absence of \NewDocumentCommand could suggest that your LaTeX installation is too old. Some kind of path messup might also do it, I suppose.

Thanks, Peter.  Duncan also suggested the age of my LaTeX installation might be the issue.

Message-ID: <BF61BBAA-FAD8-471D-B82B-FD6C207E89F4@math.uni-augsburg.de>

At the weekend I asked about a LaTex problem I had on the Mac and got an immediate solution, great!  I have accordingly updated my LaTeX using tinytex and have a new problem.  When I built my book with bookdown using the updated LaTeX there were a few small changes that I had to fix, some of which I think may have been due to a bit more space being given around tables, graphics, and lists.  There was also a large change, the table of contents has extra spacing everywhere, so that now it needs 7 pages instead of 5.  How can I get the old table of contents back?

The book is for CRCPress and uses their krantz.cls LaTeX class file.

Hi Antony,

Going back and looking at the thread over the weekend, I am wondering, if you did not uninstall the older version of TexLive/MacTeX, and there may be some conflicts with TinyTex, especially given the age of your old TexLive/MacTeX version.

I found the following report, albeit, from 2021:

  https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown/issues/2172

that might support the hypothesis of a conflict between the two TeX installations.

TeXLive/MacTex will typically install in /usr/local/texlive/XXXX, where XXXX is the year of the version. If that is still present, or there is more than one, and presuming that you want to stay with TinyTeX, I would remove the old installation(s).

There will also be a texmf-local folder in the /usr/local/texlive folder and you should probably remove that as well.

After the above, you may want to reboot your Mac, then reinstall TinyTeX, just to be sure that you then have a full and clean install.

I install the full MacTeX version of TexLive from https://tug.org/mactex/, and just update the installation each year, removing the prior year's version, typically in the March/April timeframe on release. I also do frequent incremental updates of the installation using the TexLive utility app.

Regards,

Marc Schwartz

Marc,

That makes a lot of sense, thanks for finding the rmarkdown issue and for your detailed instructions.  It turned out I had three (!) TeXLive versions, the latest being 2015, and I have deleted these and the texmf-local folder.  I also uninstalled TinyTeX, rebooted, and installed TinyTeX again.  This has not solved my problem, but I suspect I have missed deleting something that should be deleted, perhaps /Library/TeX?

Antony

Hi Antony,

Deleting the /Library/TeX folder tree would be another one to remove. There are also some links that may be in there that go back to the TexLive tree that presumably no longer exists.

That being said, in checking the uninstall instructions for TexLive, there is a note of caution that if you have multiple TeX installations, others such as TinyTeX, may very well use that same /Library/TeX tree for their own purposes.

Thus, if you do delete that tree for the sake of having a clean system, you may want to yet again, reinstall TinyTex.

If these additional steps still do not resolve the issue, it may be prudent to post to the TinyTex issues forum on Github:

  https://github.com/rstudio/tinytex/issues

perhaps with a reference back to that older rmarkdown issue, to see if any of the folks there might have some additional guidance.

Regards,

Marc

Marc,

That makes a lot of sense, thanks for finding the rmarkdown issue and for your detailed instructions. ?It turned out I had three (!) TeXLive versions, the latest being 2015, and I have deleted these and the texmf-local folder. ?I also uninstalled TinyTeX, rebooted, and installed TinyTeX again. ?This has not solved my problem, but I suspect I have missed deleting something that should be deleted, perhaps /Library/TeX?

Antony?

Hi Antony,

Going back and looking at the thread over the weekend, I am wondering, if you did not uninstall the older version of TexLive/MacTeX, and there may be some conflicts with TinyTex, especially given the age of your old TexLive/MacTeX version.

I found the following report, albeit, from 2021:

?https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown/issues/2172

that might support the hypothesis of a conflict between the two TeX installations.

TeXLive/MacTex will typically install in /usr/local/texlive/XXXX, where XXXX is the year of the version. If that is still present, or there is more than one, and presuming that you want to stay with TinyTeX, I would remove the old installation(s).

There will also be a texmf-local folder in the /usr/local/texlive folder and you should probably remove that as well.

After the above, you may want to reboot your Mac, then reinstall TinyTeX, just to be sure that you then have a full and clean install.

I install the full MacTeX version of TexLive from https://tug.org/mactex/, and just update the installation each year, removing the prior year's version, typically in the March/April timeframe on release. I also do frequent incremental updates of the installation using the TexLive utility app.

Regards,

Marc Schwartz

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Table of contents for book changed after LaTeX update


At the weekend I asked about a LaTex problem I had on the Mac and got an immediate solution, great! I have accordingly updated my LaTeX using tinytex and have a new problem. When I built my book with bookdown using the updated LaTeX there were a few small changes that I had to fix, some of which I think may have been due to a bit more space being given around tables, graphics, and lists. There was also a large change, the table of contents has extra spacing everywhere, so that now it needs 7 pages instead of 5. How can I get the old table of contents back?


The book is for CRCPress and uses their krantz.cls LaTeX class file.


Thanks, as always, for any help.

Marc,

Thanks again for the advice.   After the deletion of /Library/TeX the double-spacing of the contents was still not sorted out.  I?ll post to the TinyTex issues forum as you suggest.

Regards

Antony
