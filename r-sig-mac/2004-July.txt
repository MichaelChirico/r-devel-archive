We had a brief look at Xgrid, however at that time the only 
well-supported way of using it was the parallel execution of processes 
- i.e. you define you input data for each machine and run a process on 
each. Xgrid takes care of the distribution of files and collecting 
results. However this doesn't help in our case since we need the 
machines to talk to each other. I couldn't find any sufficient 
documentation on other methods supported by Xgrid.

We use the (very nice) "snow" package by Luke Tierney with PVM (via 
Rpvm) as backend. It works fine in our setting, but of course 
integration in Xgrid would be great. The future Xgrids are supposed to 
have some MPI support, but we didn't test it here - anyone out there 
tried that?

Cheers,
Simon

To which Brian Ripley replied  "the problem is that you compiled the code
with wide characters, and on your 10.2.8 the support functions are not
compiled into the R binary (which is what I would expect)."

Has anyone had similar problems? and solved them?

In particular, what can i do about these wide characters?

regards, ingmar visser

Message-ID: <F4B94166-CB67-11D8-823A-000393707CF2@globetrotter.net>

hi,

I am new to R but I'd like to learn while also reviewing statistical 
techniques that I feel will be useful to me in the near future. I found 
the labs prepared by
http://labdsv.nr.usu.edu/splus_R/index.html
a very useful way to start with R. But they recommend 2 packages, Vegan 
and LabDSV.

The former is available on CRAN and I successfully installed it. The 
second can be found, as a source package (I apologize if this is not 
the proper term for it), on:
http://labdsv.nr.usu.edu/download/labdsv.html

I downloaded the version for Linux/Unix:
abdsv_0.9-2.tar.gz. I tried to install the "tar.gz" file using the 
Packages menu in R, and selecting " from local files/Source Package 
file, and got:

 > install.from.file()
	npackage installation failed
 >

The same thing happened after uncompressing that file and chosing "from 
source directory" instead.

Stefano has already guided me through installing the required material 
from the developper's CD to be able to install R and packages. I did 
this and was able to download a "source package" from CRAN and install 
it successfully.

I would like to verify if I am still doing something wrong with the 
labdsv package, or if maybe it is somehow not compatible with either 
the Mac or with the version of R that I am using (1.9.1). Would it be 
possible for somebody more experienced than myself to install that 
package on a Mac? If you succeed, I would really appreciate that you 
compress the binary package and send it to me, in case I do not succeed 
even with suggestions from this list!

It's not your fault - the "thing" they offer for download is not a 
valid R package - it's rather a big mess.

To make it installable at all, you have to perform following steps:

# just copy/paste the following to a Terminal window:
cd /tmp
curl -O http://labdsv.nr.usu.edu/download/labdsv_0.9-2.zip
unzip labdsv_0.9-2.zip labdsv/DESCRIPTION
curl -O http://labdsv.nr.usu.edu/download/labdsv_0.9-1.tar.gz
cd labdsv
tar fvxz ../labdsv_0.9-1.tar.gz
rm man/template.Rd
rm src/*.o src/*.so
rm src/altmaxpact.f
open -a TextEdit.app man/confus.Rd

# now a TextEdit should open. go to the third line and replace 
\title}Confusion Table} with \title{Confusion Table} - simply the first 
bracket is reversed
# save the file and get back to the terminal and copy/paste the 
following:

open -a TextEdit.app DESCRIPTION

# again TextEdit opens; delete the last line saying "Built: ..."; save, 
get back to Terminal and copy/paste following:

cd ..
R CMD INSTALL labdsv

That should do the trick and the (wanna-be) package labdsv is installed 
(you need g77 for that of course, but you said Stefano helped you with 
that). The package contains several errors and is not on CRAN for good 
reason ... it'd never make the tests.

I hope it helps.
Cheers,
Simon

Hi!

I'm running 1.9.1 on a white iBook G3. I downloaded the sources and then 
follow the instructions on the RMacOS-FAQ to compile and install R.

I'm using "Panther" 10.3.4, with the Developer tools and the X server, and 
fink 0.7.0.cvs

Good look.

What exactly is the problem? "I can't use" isn't very specific ... 
please provide your OS version, how you installed R, what goes wrong, 
output of the console etc. etc.

Dear all,

It's sure I was too laconic in my previous message.

Here is my problem:
- the computer: an Ibook G3, with 10.2.8
-  R version: the package downloaded from CRAN
- the problem(s): first, when I use the R 1.9.1 package, the installation 
begins and stops because "a problem occurs". Sorry, no console log.
second, in the "read me" file the required configuration is os 10.2 and a G4.
third, I'm quite surprise because the installation program doesn't ask for the 
administrator password.

So, is there an easier way to install R 1.9.1 than downloading and compilling 
sources ?

Thanks in advance.

This is how I installed my ibook:

Using a complete binary install with all the packages:
ie Jan De Leuuw's complete binary install from the ucla

you have to first update your OS to 10.3
otheriwse it doesn't work.

I would guess that R 1.9.1 was built with a 10.3 deployment target 
while 1.9.0 was built with a 10.2 deployment target. Though it is 
strange that it didn't ask for the admin password---so maybe just the 
installer is borked. Our remaining 10.2 user is unfortunately away for 
the long weekend so I can't bug him about doing an install. I'm going 
to be installing R on a fresh 10.3 today so I can at least check for 
the bad installer, but not a 10.3 deployment target.

I built a package under OSX 3.3.4 and built a source package out of it by

However, when I do the same on another mac with OSX 2.8, installation fails
miserably giving the following errors:

The R.bin was compiled under 10.3 and tries to toad symbols from
libSystem which are not there in 10.2. There is no simple solution.
In general, R compiled on Panther does not run on Jaguar. So
you either downgrade or upgrade.

I don't really know, Stefano compiled it, but AFAIK he compiled it on a 
Jaguar machine, so it should be 10.2 target.

The installer shouldn't need a password if you're admin user. The 
password is only needed if you go for root authentication or if the 
user is no admin.

My Jaguar machine's HDD crashed, so ATM I have no Jag machine around 
either.

Still, without the installer log, I don't think we can help Romuald, 
because there's no way of knowing what happens ... and from his last 
post the problem was during the installation and not running R itself.

lol, I like this one :) A short by-the-way remark :) But AFAIR 10.3 
update is not quite free (or is it just us, poor Europeans that must 
pay for it?) I wish it was, but then, Apple has to finance the great 
innovations somehow (well, ok, that's what the iPod sales are for ;)). 
R doesn't really use anything 10.3 specific, so I see no reason why to 
not support 10.2 ...

I have no choice but to stick to 10.2.8 as Apple has decided WallStreet 
PBs cannot upgrade to Panther. And we are under a freeze for computer 
purchases where I work, so I have to stick to this 6 year-old machine!

A few days ago I could not use the installer from CRAN on Jaguar 
either. Stefano was surprised, and asked me to try a modified version. 
I got an error message with that new installer but it worked and I kept 
Stefano up to date. I suspect a new installer will be available soon.

Message-ID: <BADEE550-CCF5-11D8-B275-000A959F327E@math.uni-augsburg.de>

A slightly modified R.dmg image is now available from CRAN (main AT 
mirror now, others should follow as the changes propagate). To clarify 
what happened here is the history of the R.dmg images of R-1.9.1 so 
far:

1) first release - ca. 20MB (2004/06/26), installer same as in R 1.9.0
contained R-1.9.1.pkg, libxml2.pkg and a ReadMe file
both R.app and framework were packed in one package; some problems 
because it changed rights of the Applications folder and could case 
problems on non-standard systems

2) second release - ca. 40MB (2004/06/29)
new installer, but contained both the package sources and the actual 
packages. libxml2 was marked as "required" which caused problems on 
Panther (use "sudo rm -f /usr/local/lib/libxml2*" on Panther if you 
installed it)

3) third, now current release - ca. 20MB (2004/07/03)
new installer (the image contains R.mpkg meta-package and a folder 
Packages) - double-click on R.mpkg to install
allows custom installation of all three parts (you can click on 
"customize" after selecting target volume - the choices are R.app, 
Framework and libxml2). limxml2 is not selected by default, so it works 
fine on Panther.

Those having problems with earlier versions, please try the latest 
installer and report any failures. If you have problems *installing* R, 
please don't forget to include the installer log in your report 
(File->Show Log)!

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0407061055010.20888-100000@unix24.alpha.wehi.edu.au>

Hi,

I'm interested in learning about building R for MacOS X, in the 
hope that I can build a customized installation wizard 
providing R, several R packages, and some Tcl/Tk extensions 
required by my microarray GUI's limmaGUI and affylmGUI.  I have 
done this for Windows, and users have found it very useful, as 
many don't have R to start with or they don't have a recent 
version of R.  

On MacOS X, I see a few potential hurdles.  One is that the 
current R installation mechanism seems to require root 
privileges, which my I.T. staff will not allow me to have, so it 
would be hard to test a wizard after I build it unless I have to 
call for I.T. assistance every time.  On Windows, root 
privileges are recommended, but you can install R without them 
(just missing out on a few inessential Registry entries).

I'd appreciate any thoughts about this.

Regards,
James

The new R-build on http://gifi.stat.ucla.edu/pub (to be
posted later this week) consists of

1. R-devel, with binaries for close to 500 packages. This
does not support X11 and AquaTclTk , and for its GUI it uses
either Terminal.app or Emacs.app (or one of the Tck/Tk
GUI's). Also comes with RGtk. Both limmaGUI and
affyImGUI are included.

2. R-patched, with binaries for only the base and recommended
packages. This comes with X11 support and has X11 Tcl/Tk.
Its GUI can be R.app or Terminal.app or Emacs.app, but from
Terminal or Emacs you cannot use Quartz graphics.

You can switch between the two by soft linking

/Library/Framework/R.framework/Versions/Current

to either the 1.9.1 or the 2.0.0 directory.

As for your self-build question, just configure using  
--prefix=~/Library/Frameworks
instead of /Library/Frameworks. Also, as far as I know, installation of
R requires admin privileges, not root privileges. Properly configured
OS X installations do not even have a root account. Now if you intend to
run R off a server, you will need the admin password from IT, of course.

Thank you for setting this in order.  It would be helpful to have a 
clear indication on the web page (perhaps by maintaining a "latest 
information" file that currently would have the information that is 
contained in the email message) when the new version has appeared.  
(The web page still says that it was last updated on June 26.) The 
2004/07/03 version has appeared only today on the aarnet mirror.  
However I could not tell, until I copied it down and checked the date, 
that I was in fact copying down the July 3 version. I'd been through 
this process a couple of times earlier, only to find that I has the 
pre-July 3 version. The web page still says that it was last modified 
on June 26.

To which Brian Ripley replied  "the problem is that you compiled the code
with wide characters, and on your 10.2.8 the support functions are not
compiled into the R binary (which is what I would expect)."

Has anyone had similar problems? and solved them?

In particular, what can i do about these wide characters?

regards, ingmar visser

Simon kindly repacked the R.dmg for me and just the file (not the web 
page) was updated on CRAN. This is due to the fact that I'm having hard 
trouble with internet connection and I'll be still blocked for a week 
or so.
I'll update the web page when I'm back.

In principle, you just need to provide binaries for packages somewhere  
on the internet packed as .tgz archives. Then every user (no need to be  
admin) can install using the R GUI (and now also from the cmd line  
version of R) in their home after downloading these.
You can also just build these packages, make up an installer, and  
distribute this (assuming, in both cases, that R is already installed)

Not necessarily. As on any unix system you can build and install R 
without root privileges. Also note that on Mac OS X there are a kind of 
three levels - root, admin and user. Depending on the location you can 
install R using any of them.
Also note that you can build R in a directory different from the 
installation directory (although it's not trivial, since you need to 
fix dylibs). Packaging also doesn't require you to have the files in 
the target position, arbitrary directory is fine, too.

Cheers,
Simon

Hi,

My administrator just installed R 1.9.1 from CRAN on a MacOS X
machine which previously had TclTkAqua in /Library/Frameworks/
and fink Tcl/Tk in /sw/lib.  When I try to load the tcltk package, I get:

> library(tcltk)
Error in fun(...) : Can't find a usable init.tcl in the
following directories:
  /usr/local/lib/tcl8.4 /usr/local/lib/tcl8.4

This probably means that Tcl wasn't installed properly.

I suppose as with most errors, this means exactly what it says,
but should I advise my administrator to reinstall Tcl/Tk using
fink?  Is /sw/ OK, or should fink install it in /usr/local/?
If you want to install Tcl/Tk in /usr/local/ (in response to the
above error message), do you have to use a Unix-style
configure;make;make install; from Tcl/Tk source?  Is having an
old Aqua Tcl/Tk in /Library/Frameworks/ likely to be a problem?
Should this have been overwritten by an X11 Tcl/Tk by the R
1.9.1 installation from CRAN?  Or is installing X11 Tcl/Tk a
prerequisite to installing R 1.9.1 from CRAN?

Note that when I go to:
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/

find . -name init.tcl

returns nothing.

Thanks,
James

Hi James,
the R for Mac OS X FAQ, covers these issues.
The installer from CRAN does install what it says:
1) the R.framework  in /Library/Frameworks
2) the R.app (the GUI) in /Applications or any other user specified  
location
3) the libxml2 library (optional on Panther, OS X 10.3) in  
/usr/local/lib

the package tcltk distributed with R.dmg is linked against tcl/tk dlls  
inside the R.framework

It seems to me that you need to build and install tcl and tk from  
sources following the guidelines in the R for Mac OS X FAQ (i.e.  
cofingure and install from inside the unix directory and not the macosx  
one)

given your report: yes. Once I also distribute the installer for both  
tcl and tk libraries, but it is missing at the moment. I never noticed  
this issue.

Thanks.  I'll advise my adminstrator to install Tcl/Tk from
source in /usr/local/ as described in the R for Mac OS X FAQ.

I had previously noticed the instructions for installing Tcl/Tk
from source in the MacOS X FAQ, but because they were in the
section "Building R from sources", I thought I could ignore them
because we were downloading R.dmg (1.9.1) (which I assumed was
binary), rather than R-1.9.1.tgz (source), and on Windows, you
get binary Tcl/Tk bundled with R.

Regards,
James

Hi,

I just thought I'd clarfify my "wish-list" for R-Tcl/Tk 
installation on Mac OS X.

If R-Tcl/Tk could be installed without the developer tools, 
the number of Mac-users of my GUIs would more than double! 
Installing Tcl/Tk from source may seem easy enough to Unix 
command-line users, but to my GUI users (biologists), they 
generally don't have the developer tools, and if anything 
went wrong with installing Tcl/Tk from source (e.g. X11 
headers and libraries not found), then they would give up 
very quickly.  Mac-using biologists don't necessarily have 
a Unix-minded I.T. administrator.

Does anyone else like the idea of having an option of installing 
Tcl/Tk binaries in $R_HOME/Tcl/ in the same way that it is done 
on Windows?  See "R_Tcl.zip" on Duncan Murdoch's webpage:
http://www.murdoch-sutherland.com/Rtools/

Now, as far as adminstrator privileges, it looks like I still 
have a bit to learn about the difference between root and 
administrator on Mac OS X.  But my desire should be clear - to 
be able to double-click the R installer from R.dmg and install 
it in a custom directory (without getting an error message 
saying that it requires administrator privileges).  Then I could 
practise building and installing my own customized R installer.

Maybe non-administrator installation in a custom directory is 
more difficult on Mac OS X than on Windows, because Mac OS X is 
based on Unix where it is natural to choose the --prefix for 
configure BEFORE building from source (so the binaries may 
contain absolute directory paths).  Similarly, some RPMs on 
Linux can only be installed in one place.  Can Mac OS X be 
more flexible, like R for Windows?

I wish I could sound more experienced with installing R on Mac, 
but we have a strict I.T. department which won't let me install 
anything requiring admin or root privileges.

Best regards,
James

It can always be installed w/o developer tools. If you're worried about 
add-ons then I'd rather worry about X11 which isn't installed by 
default ;).

Well, it's one way to go ... I guess the problem is that there is not 
just one Tck/Tk for OS X. The native versions come as frameworks which 
makes sense. Supplying X11 versions as frameworks is questionable, but 
possible. Since the X11 versions are not really Mac-native, they 
probably shouldn't "shadow" the native way (frameworks)... I guess some 
people think they should go to /usr/local/...

root - user with all privileges - this one is by default disabled in OS 
X (i.e. you can't directly login as root)
admin - an user belonging to the "admin" group which is used throughout 
the system (e.g. you can write in Applications) also can use sudo to 
run commands in the root context

There's no error message :P Anyway, but "custom directory" is a 
problem. Not from the installer point of view - you can install 
anything anywhere, but R is not easily relocatable. The only way to 
relocate R is to patch all binaries and modify dynamic references. It 
can be done, but is tedious and error-prone. This is why we have the 
fixed framework and relocatable R.app.

It's not really a question of the operating system being more flexible 
or not. It's the way things are linked, built and installed. IMHO the 
building process could be slightly modified to allow relocatable R 
framework (don't use paths in linked objects and rely on LIBRARY_PATH). 
However there are some issues with add-ons such as newly compiled 
packages. The main problem is that we would need to kind of `bypass' 
the framework concept and use our own concept that requires several 
preparations before R or libR can be used (setting correct LP etc.) -  
and that's what we wanted to prevent. Moreover you could create 
inconsistencies when libraries are loaded from somewhere else that 
you'd expect (which can happen on Windows).

Again, a compromise would be to fix all paths on install ...

But back to your issue: why would you want to insist on re-locatable 
framework? One way of achieving what you want would be to use one of 
the regular places like Applications or Users/Shared - at least I guess 
that should work for your biologists and you wouldn't have to think 
about OS X internals... Moreover if you want to deal with Tcl/Tk you 
ran into relocation issues, too.

Simon,

Thanks very much for your reply.

To further clarify one thing, the relocatable R installation 
issue is certainly not important for the end user, but is more 
an issue for me in practising building and installing a 
customized wizard without having sufficient installation 
privileges.  I have had great success doing this on Windows, 
without ever being able to write to the Windows Registry (for 
LOCAL_MACHINE, only CURRENT_USER), and without being able to 
write to C:\Program Files\ or C:\WINNT.  

I do understand the multiple Tcl/Tk issue for MacOS X.  My 
impression is that Aqua Tcl/Tk has the nicest binary 
installation wizards at the moment (which is natural because it 
is 'native'), but for now, X11 seems to work more reliably with 
R, which is why I was thinking of an X11 binary Tcl/Tk bundled 
with R for Mac in the way binary Tcl/Tk is bundled with R for 
Windows.  (Then I'd be quite happy for it to be replaced by 
Aqua Tcl/Tk in the future.)  But I'll read over your email 
again, and give it some more thought.

Regards,
James

Hi James,

just for you convenience, I've add a package installer for the X11 
TclTk libraries.
It still require privileges though.

I think it is reasonable to distribute tcltk inside the framework, but 
it's not just a matter of dlls path in this case as the dll are there 
(inside the R.framework) with the correct paths (the problem is in that 
I did not patch the tcltk package to take the good tcl.ini and tk.ini 
files).

the R.framework per se is relocatable, the problem is that moving the 
R.framework outside "standard" locations, i.e. where the linker and 
apps expect they to be, make every additional binary distibuted package 
to fail and even building of packages to fail.
The same applies to apps  embedding R.

I don't think that bypass the framework is a good idea as it is the way 
apple thinks about its system.

But relocation is not what I understand you are saying James. R.app is 
relocatable in the sense you can move it at any time on your system. A 
framework (any) once installed, to be moved requires  many things 
(related to the path) to be fixed.
We can certainly prepare a script to do the task, but this is not the 
way you do things on Macs

what you can reasonably do James, is to ask your system manager to 
install the tcltk stuff and the developer tools (how can you build your 
packages without?).
Packages will be built in your local directory ~/Library/R/library, 
tar.gz the binaries and distribute them. They will work.

My GUI packages are just R packages with no compiled code.  They
just use the tcltk package, e.g. tt<-tktoplevel() etc.  I don't
have a Mac in my office, so I like to build a Win32 binary .zip
version and a .tar.gz source version of each R package from
Windows.  Then I would hope that R on MacOSX could install a
.tar.gz "source" R package without developer tools (given that
there's only R code, no compiled C or Fortran code).  Of
course, I've noticed on CRAN, that Mac OS X binary versions of
R packages are starting to appear, so maybe I should do that as
well.  But for now I'm just trying to learn a nice way to
install my R packages (requiring the standard tcltk + Tktable
and BWidget) for Mac users without the developer tools.

On Windows, there's no multiple Tcl/Tk issue, so my R package's
.First.lib() looks in the Windows registry for ActiveTcl (the
standard Tcl/Tk distribution for Windows) and automatically
runs addTclPath() from within R so that Tktable and BWidget can
be found and gives a warning if ActiveTcl is not found.   But
I still allow a custom Tcl/Tk installation), e.g. the user can
run addTclPath() themself from R or they can set environment
variables TCL_LIBRARY="C:\Tcl\lib" and MY_TCLTK="Yes".

Maybe I can eventually do something similar (to what I do
with ActiveTcl) with TclTkAquaBI.

Best regards,
James

currently (as-is 1.9.1) it's not as I explained to James (I should've 
CC it here I guess) - R.bin and libR.dylib are both linked to readline 
using full path to the R home. There are several other minor issues 
like newly compiled packages containing absolute paths etc.

/me nods
@James: note that if you create your own, relocatable version of R you 
will have to check whether the CRAN packages work with it. If they 
won't then you're definitely in trouble, because installing packages is 
what most people need in the first place.

Again, they will only work if at least the following is satisfied
1) they are relocatable - because every user's home is in a different 
path (and ~ is only a shell construct, not a valid path)
2) before loading the libraries some script will find the proper 
libraries and setup the environment correspondingly

However I still think that the best way is to use regular R 
installation in /Library/Frameworks ... it's supported, transparent and 
extensible. As I said before, installing X11 requires co-operation of 
the admin anyway, so he can as well install R, too.

Cheers,
Simon

The 07/07/04 version is big. It consists of two R's rolled into one. It  
updates R-devel and R-patched to their 07/01/04 versions. X11 Tcl/Tk  
8.5 and X11 Emacs are included as well. You can switch between the two  
versions of R by soft linking. For example:
  > cd /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/
  > sudo rm Current
  > sudo ln -s 1.9.1 Current
If you use the (default) 2.0.0 you get the version for the Terminal and  
Emacs with Quartz graphics and Aqua Tcl/Tk, if you use 1.9.1 you get  
X11 Tcl/Tk and support for R.app. The 1.9.1 version also uses the BLAS  
and Lapack that come with R, not vecLib.framework. Binaries for 500  
contributed packages are in the 2.0.0 version, but I may add some stuff  
to 1.9.1 such as tkrplot and rgl that do not work with my 2.0.0  
version.

Hi, I have a few questions as a new user to R and some wishes for the 
interface.

First, is a way to specify which packages should be opened 
automatically when one starts R? Ideally a pane of the preferences 
would show the packages that are installed, like the "Packages/Package 
Manager" command does, but the boxes that would be checked there would 
be remembered and this list would be opened each time R starts. 
Obviously this is not implemented now, so is there an alternative that 
exists now, maybe a command file that is automatically read when R 
starts and where I could specify packages to be loaded automatically?

Second, I don't know what to think of the Help menu. Because I got no 
result from using it except a slowing down of my computer, I opened the 
Process Viewer (I think it is called this in English, it is Moniteur 
d'activit? in French). I should precise that I am working on a 700 MHz 
iMac with 768 Mo RAM and OS X 10.3.4. With no application other than 
Finder, Mail, and Process Viewer, around 90% of the Processor Time is 
available. Launching R does not change this much.

For this test, the first thing I did in R was selecting "Help/R Help", 
the R Console says this:

 > help.start()
Making links in per-session dir ...
If /usr/bin/open is already running, it is *not* restarted, and you 
must switch to its window.
Otherwise, be patient ...
 >

But nothing else of use happens. What is /usr/bin/open? How can I 
switch to its window? There is not a Open application that appears in 
the dock for me to switch to its window.
At this point my Mac becomes sluggish, the processor activity jumped 
from about 10 to 100%, and the two culprit are kernel_task (user Root) 
and Open (user chabotd), with each about 45% of CPU time. Quitting R 
does not stop these tasks. Indeed, after restarting R and choosing Help 
again, I now have one kernel_task but two Open tasks! And still no 
help!

I also tried the "Help/R for Mac OS X FAQ", but all that did is start 
the hated rainbow spinning ball. This opened another "Open task". while 
I typed this paragraph, R froze and I cannot go back to it, I can only 
force quit it. I just did but the kernel_Task and the two Open tasks 
still hug my CPU, so I'll have to force quite them as well!

I don't know Process Viewer very well, but it has an export button. If 
you are interested, I used this button before launching Help from R and 
after. I opened those plist files with TextWrangler and the information 
is not in a format I can use easily, but maybe it is usable by whoever 
will look in this matter. I will be pleased to email these 2 files on 
request.

Is Help working better for others or is this just a growing pain of the 
new Aqua interface for R?

Thanks in advance,

Sincerely,

Denis Chabot

Hi!

>From the command line type:

Take a careful look at. Now type:
?options

On the other hand, '/usr/bin/open' or 'open' for short is a MacOX command 
which open files  using the default application associated with its 
extension. In my iBook the RHelp opens the Safari browser. Can you tell 
which is your default browser?

Why don't you try with the recently released R.dmg? (browse the 
list files). It seems to me like something is wrong with your current 
installation of R. 

Good look.

Hi All,

I am building a package on Mac OS X using C++ and Fortran.
I am getting a "Trace/BPT trap" error which means nothing to me I'm afraid.

I am using the gcc compilers, g++ and g77 to compile, these are invoked by
calling R CMD INSTALL etc.

Can anyone help me with this particular error and/or point me to strategies
for debugging C++ code when building packages fo R.

Any suggestions are welcome,

ingmar visser

The error isn't helpful usually. If there is really no further messages 
(about libraries, symbols etc.), then you may want to run R in a 
debugger. For example you can use gdb - start R like this:

R -d gdb

then type
run

after messing around with your library to get the error you can get a 
stack trace with
bt

for details see the help command in the gdb.

(Alternative way of attaching a gdb into a running R process is to run 
gdb and type "attach R.bin")

I hope it helps...

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] affy pcg installation and XML installation in Panther
Message-ID: <p06100500bd1bfa5c4b8f@[83.132.28.1]>

hi to you all

I am trying to install the affy package from bioconductor and I have 
been very unsuccessful!

I have a G4, MacOSX panther and the R version 1.9.1 installed.

One of the problems is that the XML tools are not installed. I tried 
to install a package called libXML2.pkg, but there's an indication 
that it might be for Jaguar only.
When I installed BioConductor from the CRAN repository it gave 23 
warnings most of them concerning XML.
[1] "Installing XML" Note: Package XML not found in any known repository.

Any idea on how to solve the problem (if it's solvable...)

I am sorry about this basic question, and for those of you in the 
bioconductor list this might be the second time with the question

libXML is not necessary (and it's even hurtful) for Panther, because it 
is already included with the system. The "XML tools" doesn't mean the 
system library.

This is some problem with your repository settings on your machine and 
is not Mac dependent. Today I able to install XML package w/o any 
problems. Although getBioC does the job, too, you can still use the 
regular R way using install.packages("XML").

Cheers,

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] 1) pdf output and 2) a "by" feature in R?
Message-ID: <D01B5FBE-D7DE-11D8-A6F3-000393707CF2@globetrotter.net>

Hi,

I have started only recently using R and am still learning, however I 
managed to get some GAM analyses done, which was the main reason I 
started learning R in the first place.

I found out I could create pdf files directly when I created a large 
number of graphics in one session, instead of creating one or more 
quartz graph windows and saving them manually.

In Panther, there is no difference between the pdf files created by 
either method. They look beautiful in Preview, in Acrobat, inserted in 
LaTeX files for pdf output, everywhere but in Word documents(!) as one 
would expect.

But in Jaguar, pdf files created by outputing to a quarz window and 
saving manually, be it from R running on Jaguar or Panther, are fine. 
But those created by calling pdf, either on Panther or Jaguar, do not 
show any text when viewed with Jaguar's Preview, nor do they show any 
text when processed into a LaTeX document to a pdf file. I'm sorry that 
I have forgotten to print the pdf graphics or the LaTeX created pdf 
document to check whether the text was there. But I did check that both 
the pdf graphics file and the LaTeX created pdf document had all their 
text intact when viewed with Acrobat 6 under Jaguar.

It seems a glitch in Jaguar's Preview (maybe TeXShop's pdf viewer uses 
Preview's engine). But I'd like to know what is different between the 
pdf graphics created directly by calling pdf and those created by 
outputing to screen and saving manually.

My next question might be better asked in a R list instead of a R for 
Mac list. If so please forgive me and just tell me so. But since this 
list has been so helpful for me already, I will try here.

Stats package I have been using until now (recently this has been 
mostly JMP on my Mac and SAS at work, the latter thanks to the Citrix 
client for Mac as it is on a all-Windows network) have a "by" feature 
which I use a lot. I can take a file and calculate the mean, for 
example, of the abundance of a large number of prey items in cod 
stomachs, "by" subsets that could be cod size and year of sampling. The 
output can contain all possible combinations of the above (even 
intermediate results, such as 50-55 cm cod from all years) or just the 
most detailed subset (years by cod length categories, all pairwise). 
This table is then directly usable by me for many plots I need to 
produce.

I have not seen a "by" in R. It has no entry in "help". I have seen 
references to loops, but my knowledge of R is still too limited to 
imagine how I could ask an analysis like the above with loops. Am I 
missing the simple way in which this would be done in R, or is there no 
simple way? If, horror, the latter is true, is R a "fixed" language, 
new functionalities being provided exclusively by new packages, or is 
the language still evolving, in which case the addition of a "by" 
feature could be made (if I knew where to send it...)

Thanks in advance,

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] R-aqua crashing after upgrade to 1.9.1
Message-ID: <89DB1396-DCCC-11D8-A12F-000393B2DF14@earthlink.net>

Hi,

I upgraded yesterday from 1.9.0 to 1.9.1 using the R.dmg on CRAN.   I  
didn't erase any of the existing frameworks/apps, and assumes the  
installer would overwrite them as necessary.

R crashes whenever I disconnect from my Postgresql database:

library("chron") #needed for date columns
library("Rdbi")
library("Rdbi.PgSQL")
pcon <-  
dbConnect(PgSQL(),host="localhost",dbname="test",user="postgres",passwor 
d="<mypassword>")
dbListTables(pcon)  #works fine, as do other SQL operations
dbDisconnect(pcon) #causes R to pause (beachball), then crash

I also experience a crash after issuing help.search

I am not sure whether this is related to OSX build of R, or the dbi  
module, but I would guess the former.

The simplest thing for me to try is wiping and reinstalling R.  Is it  
just a matter of removing

/Library/Frameworks/R.framework
/Applications/R.app
~/Library/Preferences/R.bin.plist

?

Or are there other files to remove.  Also, I append the crash log  
generated after the dbDisconnect command in case it provides any useful  
info.

Thanks for any help.

Jim

FYI - it was actually the Rdbi library I was using which caused this, I 
upgraded to a more recent version and that solved things.  Pardon the 
false alarm...

Hi.

I would the R workspace browser capability a lot, but it's kind of 
unusable unless I'm doing something wrong

when I open that from workspace menu, it opens a window that gives me 
info about each object but if I change any object the changes are not 
automatically reflected
even worse, if I click on "R workspace browser" again from the menu 
(hoping to have the menu refreshed in that way...) the browser goes 
blank. I have to close it, open it again to see the changes reflected!

any ideas on this?

thanks

	update on bioconductor
Message-ID: <p06100501bd2ab9140445@[83.132.28.35]>

hi

a) I want to use the affy function on bioconductor. I have R 9.1 and 
Panther on a powerbook G4.

I have installed the package, everything seems fine. One of the 
functions is rma and asks for a cdf file. Those files (the info on 
the affymetrix chips) are downloadable from the bioconductor pages 
and the page does it automatically. Except that for some reason it 
doesn't install it, it gives an error saying there's no package 
called drosgenome1cdf (the file I need)

I know that file is there. I downloaded it manually and still 
couldn't install it.
finally I used some tools from the affy package to make the cdf 
file/package that I need (function: make.cdf.package)
the function run ok, built a package whose folder is in the R 
library, the package manager recognizes it but when I try to install 
it gives the error:
loading package: drosgenome1cdf Error in testRversion(descfields) : 
This package has not been installed properly

I have no idea if anyone can help me here



b) other thing: when I get the bioconductor update from the menu it 
doesn't do it and shows the following error:

Note: argument `lib' is missing: using 
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/library

and then:


Error in getVersVals(e1, e2)

since I'm doing this straight from the menu with the mouse, I was 
very suprise it didn't work!


thanks for any help

Hi

I went to

and then to
http://popgen0146uns50.unimaas.nl/~jlindsey/rcode.html
to download rmutil.tgz and gnlm.tgz.

I have a mac OSX, 10.3.4, R 1.9.0
I decompress the two files, take out the makefile from the
scr directory.
then in the R menu, I choose
packages, install from local files, and then I select the
one of the folder on the desktop.
I get the error message
install.from.file(pkg="/Users/anne/Desktop/rmutil")
	npackage installation failed

Anyone has had that problem before and know how to fix it?

thanks

Anne, I'm not sure about your specific package, but I'm wondering if  
you have the right privileges to install packages.  Does it work if you  
run R from the command line with sudo R - and then do the installation?
HTH, David.

By default the installations in the Aqua GUI are to a local directory so
this is unlikely to be the problem.   You can find what the actual problem
is by looking at the Console log, in Applications | Utilities | Console.

Do you have the developer tools installed?  The package needs C and
Fortran compilers.  I get different error messages (below).

In any case it doesn't seem to work, because of a problem in dist.c.

^^^ did you install Apple Devel tools, g77 and other things necessary 
for source installation? It doesn't seem so (see Stefano's FAQ). The 
above stat errors are suspicious, too, but devel-tools are the 
necessary anyway.

Other than that, it works for me. As always there's a pitfall on some 
systems (depends on your setup) - if you get undefined restFP and 
saveFP the edit the Makefile and add -L/usr/lib -lgcc before $(FLIBS)

Cheers,
Simon

Some of the Lindsay packages use deprecated R functions.  They are
all sitting as binaries in the R-devel on  
http://gifi.stat.ucla.edu/pub, but
I cannot update some of them any more.

Naw, the stat errors are pretty common. They usually pop up when the 
developer is lazy and doesn't write any help. As you can imagine, I see 
them quite often :-)

Thank you all for your help. gnlm requires the disk4 xcode
1.2 of panther, in addition, rmutil requires g77.

After that, I had to go to the package manager to enable the
two packages. After that, I was able to use one of the
functions!

thank you all, I could not have done it without your help!

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] interesting R<->Cocoa side effects
Message-ID: <7B256F2A-E1FC-11D8-BD0D-000D93C24D64@hsph.harvard.edu>

Hi all, I've been playing with the Cocoa interface that Stefano has 
been putting into R-devel, guided by Simon Urbanek's code 
(incidentally, the RGUI bundle code on Stefano's site while attempting 
to get the console prompt under 2.0.0) and I've discovered some 
interesting properties. In particular, if you take control of the main 
menu the Quartz device causes R to crash. The trouble seems to be that 
the various pointers (GetQuartzParameters and FocusOnConsole for 
instance) don't get installed at startup. I haven't tried the various 
editors and package installation windows yet.

On the plus side it did inspire me to spend some time implementing a 
Cocoa interface for the graphics devices that is 90% 
functional---there's a weird NSView sizing bug (that may actually be on 
the Cocoa side of things) and the fonts are completely wonky (huge, not 
to mention upside down) to work out, but otherwise things seem to be 
working just fine.

It seems like the best solution is to have a "cocoa_graph" bit to set 
that loads the Cocoa device bindings if set and otherwise sets up the 
appropriate Carbon bindings if not such that implementors don't have to 
take control of the graphics device. At any rate, I'll post a diff once 
I get the two problems above sorted out. I'll also be dumping my GUI 
into CVS, likely at the StatPaper site, for people to play. It works a 
little bit differently than Simon's and I'm also experimenting 
unabashedly with Panther facilities like SearchKit for the help system.

It must be the water in California that makes me want to write Cocoa 
code or something :-)
