Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] OSX Binary Installation and testInstalledPackages()
Message-ID: <62EF36D5-4907-4406-9649-09B158D76EC2@me.com>

Hi all,

I have been building R from source for a number of years on Linux and for the past 3 years, on OSX. Since circa version 2.9.0 I believe, there have been functions available in the 'tools' package to run post-installation tests of the base and recommended packages. These parallel the post-build from source 'make check-all' functionality, but can be run within R. They run the help file examples, more extensive package specific tests as well as vignette code when present.

When building from source, one can run 'make install-tests' to install the required files to run the more extensive package tests after the initial build, rather then just the examples in the help files.

On Windows, there is an option during the GUI installation of the pre-built binary, to install these additional test files.

When installing the pre-built binary for OSX, just to consider that path, I did not see an option to install these test files and I don't see any CLI functionality to replicate the installation of the test files that would be performed when building from source. A search of the R.framework tree did not yield any indication that the files are present, which would normally be in a 'tests' folder (eg. see https://svn.r-project.org/R/branches/R-2-14-branch/tests/).

So, are these files not installed or made available when using the OSX binary or am I missing something? I did not see anything relevant in the OSX FAQ for R and a search of the manuals and the archives yielded no joy. Presumably, one can just copy the files from the SVN repo above, being sure to match rev numbers during the check-out.

Thanks for any insights.

Regards,

Marc Schwartz

Yes, they are not available in the binary distribution. You can still use make install-tests when compiling your own R, and since they are arch-independent you can pick any architecture for that.

It would be certainly possible to include the test files in the distribution, but so far you are the first person asking about that, so it doesn't seem prudent. However, it would be even easier to just add a separate tar ball of tests to the http://R.reasearch.att.com site for nightly builds if that would satisfy your needs.

Cheers,
Simon

Thanks for your reply and confirmation. I can certainly continue, as I have done, to build R from source. In my case, I build 32 bit R, as I don't have a need for the additional memory address space provided by 64 bits, even though I have 8Gb on my MBP. It takes about 20 minutes to build and another 40 to run the full suite of tests.

I was just doing some forward looking, considering alternatives to building from source and instead using the OSX binaries, both the stable release on CRAN and the patched versions that you kindly provide at the URL you list above. There are benefits to using the "official" binaries of course.

Providing a tarball of the tests folder, matching svn revs, for the nightlies, would certainly be helpful. Presumably there would need to be a brief README file so that folks would know how and where to install them. I can assist with that, if you desire. The default location would be /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resource/tests (eg. R.home("tests")).

My broad perspective is that these tests are in effect, an integral part of validating an R installation, which is something that I do. While this has special meaning for folks involved in clinical trials (eg. see 6.3 in http://www.r-project.org/doc/R-FDA.pdf), it seems logical that this would have value to folks in other domains as well. It would make it easier for useRs to fully utilize the functions in 'tools' that R Core has taken the time and consideration to provide.

Presumably, somewhere along the way around the time of 2.9.0, a decision was made to enable the test files to be optionally installed when using the Windows binary for ease of access, to enable that user base to be able to run the more extensive tests available. It would seem logical from a consistency perspective, to enable the OSX user base to have similar ease of access. I can't speak to what the various Linux packagers of R do, since that may vary across distributions due to differing packaging standards and it is possible that some may not even be aware of the tests functionality.

Thus, if and when convenient, it would seem ideal to make these a standard part of the OSX binaries. The entire tests tree is only about 5 Mb, so it does not materially add to local data storage requirements.

Thanks again Simon and let me know what I can do to assist. Feel free to contact me offlist.

Regards,

Marc

Yes, it was added on Windows at user request (including the ability to 
install the tests directory from sources).  But as the Windows 
installers have much finer-grained granularity controlling what should 
be installed, people worried about space could skip it (and AFAIR it is 
not installed by default).

These days it is hard to imagine that anyone would be concerned about 
the size of an R installation, but it was not so long ago that people 
were squeezing R onto USB drives.  Nowadays the only reason not to 
simply install everything is that installing 64-bit executables on a 
32-bit OS which cannot run them might be confusing: and although in 
principle that might happen on OS X, I think you would have to work hard 
to try to run them.  (I think that Intel Core Duo Macs can only run 
i386, but they seem to be from 2006.)

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] object '.lec.Random.seed.table' not found
Message-ID: <4F2A0F51.3070206@postgrad.manchester.ac.uk>

Hi all,

I attempted to install "RSPRNG" package in OSX Lion by just selecting it 
from the Package Installer menu, and later realised it was a stupid 
idea! However, after the installation failed, the error "object 
'.lec.Random.seed.table' not found" appeared when I run the following code:

test = function( iter , cores )
{
     cl = makeCluster( cores , type = "SOCK" );
     clusterSetupRNG( cl );
     registerDoSNOW( cl );


     output = foreach( i = 1:iter , .combine = "rbind") %dopar%
     {
         runif( 1 , 0 , 1 );
     }

     stopCluster( cl );

output;
}

test( 100 , 2 )

The reason that I wanted to install "RSPRNG", is because I seemed to get 
the same "random" number stream every time when I run the code above.

My question is, 1) how can I fix the error. 2) How can I avoid getting 
the same random number stream for each nodes?

Many thanks
Terry

Terry,

The function clusterSetupRNG is using the RNGstream from rlecuyer 
package by default. There was a bug in the latest version of the 
rlecuyer package (0.3-2). A corrected version (0.3-3) is now sitting in 
the queue to be published on CRAN. So it should become available within 
the next few days.

Message-ID: <4F2A9C2A.80700@witthoft.com>

Hi,
Someone claimed in this StackOverflow thread 
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9107695/r-comment-out-block-of-code 
that the sequence "CMD-OPT-`"  would comment the selected block.  What 
it does, on my machine, is to place the "`" at the start and end of the 
selection, which of course just makes a mess.

So-- is there actually a  keystroke to apply "#" to all selected rows in 
the editor?  And while I'm at it,  does "CMD-OPT-`" have an intended 
use, or is it something "leftover" in the R.app editor code?

Many thanks
Carl

A little hacking later:

CMD-'   will apply "#" to each line,
CMD-OPT-'  will remove them.

But I'm still interested in knowing what other undocumented keystrokes

Hi Carl,

please have look at main menu > Edit for the short-cuts for "Comment-Out" and "Uncomment".

commenting out a selection or current line: ?+'
uncommenting a selection or line: ??+'

I think there was a confusion of a backtick ` and a '

Do you wonder why a selection will be wrapped by `` after pressing ` well then I can help you.

If you select something in the R script editor or in the RConsole and you will then press ( or { or [ or " or ' or ` then the selection will be wrapped by these characters; of course for parentheses by the corresponding closing variant.

Since ??+` is not assigned to any command this short-cut will simply wrap the selection by ``.

The current builds now contains tests. As Brian noted size is probably not an issue anymore so it was the easiest to simply run install-tests in the build.

Simon,

Thanks so much for making this change!

I downloaded the latest nightly and ran all tests (testInstalledBasic("both") and then testInstalledPackages() for examples, tests and vignettes for both base and recommended) locally here, which all pass. This is great!

Will this change also show up in the next stable release on CRAN?

For those who may still be following this thread, be sure that you run these tests in an R session using 'R --vanilla' from the command line (OSX Terminal app in Applications/Utilities), rather than using R.app or other GUIs (eg. RStudio, etc.). You may have modifications in your .Rprofile or elsewhere that may conflict with these tests and the GUI's may similarly alter the default environment. In addition, you should run these tests before installing any CRAN or other third party packages, which may also result in some conflicts with these tests. 

Simon, thanks again for this change and the incredibly fast turn around!

Best regards,

Marc

Yes, there is no difference in release builds and the nightly builds (which is sort of the point of the nightlies so you can test pre-releases).

Dear list,

Would it be possible to include the pdf versions of the R manuals in the 
CRAN mac R install? I find them easier to global search than html ones. 
(I am used to having them on Windows.)

I generally copy the link to the html and paste them into my browser.  
The search in the default GUI-invoked help panel doesn't handle  
punctuation or revisions to searches at all well. The text get  
overwritten in the bottom entry slot and I don't think the search- 
revisions actually occur.

I prefer Adobe reader's directory search. But I don't have the 
up-to-date set of pdf manuals on my computer. I can do an easy global 
search of the html manuals with text wrangler but I then have to read 
html. I am thinking I will have to start building my own R just to get 
the ability to build the manual pdf's.

I don't think you have to do that. I also like using the pdf manuals for browsing/searching/...

I recently built the pdf manuals for R-2.14.1. I have attached two scripts that did it for me.

The setup script prepares the R build system.
The make-R-pdf script just makes the pdf manuals and copies them to the current directory.
Both these scripts should placed in the directory where you have unpacked R sources (R-2.14.1.tar.gz).

Comments and improvements welcome.

They are also available for download from CRAN, though you won't get the 
Mac OSX FAQ.  See the "Documentation" link on the left.

I forget whether there's a way to add items to the menu, but you can 
certainly write a function to pick one and open it, e.g.

doc <- function(manual=file.choose()) {
   system(paste('open', manual))
}

If you have multiple versions of R installed it is really convenient 
that they contain the appropriate manuals.  I have an archive back to 
2.0.0 (and a few before) that I consult surprisingly often.

Our dept builds for Linux have always done 'make install install-pdf', 
and I think the argument that binary distributions of R should contain 
all the useful pieces is strong now space does not matter.

The Windows team have decided to simplify their installer for 2.15.0 
and always install all the documentation and tests, so the only 
choices will be 32-bit, 64-bit or both.

Thanks for the scripts, Berend. With one or two amendments they ran 
successfully (my compilers have -4.2 attached to their names). But it 
did seem rather a lot of work (on the part of my computer). After 
Duncan's response, I decided it might be easier to write an R script 
using download.file to get them from CRAN. My R is much better than my 
shell script.

Since we are in the phase of adding things to the distribution anyway it is certainly trivial to add the pdf manuals so I shall do that.

Personally, I prefer nightly builds of the R-devel manuals in html, so I use http://r.research.att.com/man/

Thanks,

Many thanks, Simon. Also to the other respondents for their suggestions.

The link for the nightly builds will also be useful, once I have found 
out which manual I need by searching the pdf's.

Sure, you're welcome.

While I'm thinking about this, I have also added the nightly PDF manuals to the webpage as well as the Mac FAQ (in html).

Best,
Simon

Sounds like corrupted font files. The quartzFonts are different than  
the pdfFonts. This is based on experience with earlier version of  
MacOS. In my (earlier) system the fix has been to find the Helvetica  
fonts in Fontbook.app and remove the corrupted (often duplicated) ones  
which you can identify as being the ones that display as blanks.

Thanks a lot David, your advice was the good one.
I found that I had Arial fonts in both /Library/Fonts and
/Users/myhome/Library/Fonts. Removing the one from myhome did solve
the issue.

Like others in the referenced thread, I can reproduce this on Mac OS X
10.5.8 with R 2.14.1 using R.app but it works just fine from the
Terminal CLI so it's likely something in the GUI rather than R itself:
I'll forward this to R-SIG-Mac and see if Simon (Urbanek) picks it up.

Interestingly, this is a bug in R: R_ReplDLLdo1() fails to invoke top-level handlers (txtStart uses top-level handler to collect values of expressions but the handler is never called). This may be a one-liner fix but I'll have to double-check tomorrow since changes in the REPL code tend to have bad consequences.

Thanks,

Hello all,

I have looked around the archives and have seen no mention of this. I
am using Cairo package 1.5-1 to generate some PNG files on MacOS
10.6.8 using R 2.14.1. Every PNG that I generate has a yellow
background to it no matter what I set the background option to. Even
the test code from the CairoPNG documentation (below) exhibits this
behavior:

# very simple KDE
Cairo(600, 600, file="plot.png", type="png", bg="white")
plot(rnorm(4000),rnorm(4000),col="#ff000018",pch=19,cex=2) #
semi-transparent red
dev.off() # creates a file "plot.png" with the above plot

To see the output from this, please go to
http://www.joeschwab.com/CairoPNG-test/plot.png

I am using the Cairo package because I am developing on a Mac, but
deploying onto a Linux server that does not have X11 support, but
doeswork with Cairo. On my linux server, plots generated on a device
created with Cairo/CairoPNG look just fine.

Any thoughts/help/suggestions would be appreciated.

Cheers,
Joe

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] libpng update fixes Cairo background issues
Message-ID: <C8D11250-9996-4FBB-A641-933BEF903EEE@r-project.org>

There was a bug in libpng 1.5.2 that produced corrupted RGB24 png images. The main symptom was visible in Cairo: if you specified fully opaque background color then the colors of the image would be all wrong. This is now fixed by updating libpng to 1.5.8 on the CRAN build machine. If you encounter the problem, please re-install Cairo, png or R-patched tomorrow depending where you encountered the problem (use http://r.research.att.com as the mirror for packages - CRAN mirrors should follow later).

PS: Some good soul reported this problem yesterday -- and the e-mail got lost (IMAP issues..) so if that good soul happens to read this, please reply to me.

Thanks,
Simon

Hi All,

before I do something stupid, will XCode 4.3 play nice with R? my guess is that I should 

-- install Xcode 4.3 
-- get rid of Xcode 4.2.1 and /Developer
-- install the command line tools
-- possibly reinstall GNU Fortran 4.2.4 for Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion) from http://r.research.att.com/tools/

and be merry?

More or less - Xcode on Lion doesn't touch R compilers anymore so Xcode updates don't matter (as long as you installed the Lion gcc+gfortran bundle at some point).

This has been reported multiple times on this list. It generally  
means  fonts used by that device have been corrupted. In this case you  
should look to see what quartzFonts()  produces and if the missing  
text was the "sans" flavor:

 > quartzFonts("sans")
$sans
[1] "Helvetica"             "Helvetica-Bold"        "Helvetica-Oblique"
[4] "Helvetica-BoldOblique"

Use Font Book.app to investigate. If I'm right, you will find a  
(possibly duplicated) blank version for Helvetica. Delete it.

I'm not sure what that means (there being no "Apple" key on my  
Apple(tm) keyboard),  but what ever it was, there is nothing attached.  
Pdf files are generally accepted, and I have noticed that some mailers  
are able to attach .png files which do not get scrubbed by the mail  
server, but the default format for the Grab.app program is tiff and I  
don't think that format gets passed through. A tiff screenshot may be  
a megabyte in size which is larger than the mailing list likes to  
Archive. Maybe you should select the text and copy into the body of  
your message?

Furthermore there does not appear to be a good connection between the  
subject line and the rest of this message. One wonders whether you  
have read the "Clipboard" section that you get with ?clipboard?

Oh. I guess my memory for names is not so good. This posting first  
appeared in my mailer this morning. It seems to have gotten help up in  
"the Internet" for an unreasonably long time. I sort my mail by date  
received. I didn't notice the sent date. (It's also got a different  
Subject than the Feb 9 posting, so I think there is some evidence that  
you sent two separate messages.) Why it was held up by the mail server  
at phil3.ethz.ch for 2 weeks before sending on to the list is a  
mystery to me, but that is what the headers are telling me.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] R GUI: expansion of paths in Console when dragging from
	Finder
Message-ID: <87A77160-FA14-4E0C-911A-1012465A4757@gmail.com>

Hello all,

in R.app (GUI), dragging a folder into the Console used to expand the full path to the folder as far as I remember. Now the behavior seems to have changed. In many cases, the full path is still expanded (somewhat; the tilde abbreviation "~" is used for a users home directory). However, if the selection in the Finder is a file or directory below R's current working directory, only a relative path is inserted into the command window. This can be puzzling.

What is the motivation for this change? In my opinion, the old behavior was more consistent, and also more useful because it could be used to obtain the full path to a file. I would also prefer if the behavior were consistent between the GUI and command line R (in which dragging always leads to full path expansion).

Regards,
Jochen


PS: On a related note, having the (almost) full path to a file expanded in the debug prompt can make the output hard to read.

Hi Jochen,

sorry, it was my fault. I had the wrong default in mind while implementing a feature.

I've just fixed it. Now, dragging file(s) with the extension other than *.R or *.Rdata will insert the full path. If you hold down the ALT key ? while dragging the relative path(s) to the current set working directory and R script file path resp. will be inserted.

Dragging *.R files will insert a "source(...)" and dragging *.Rdata files will insert a "load(...)" snippet template. This can be controlled by holding down the ALT key ? or CMD key ? or both.

The "source(...)" template is using the new introduced so-called snippet system (a kind of programmable macro or template system [if you know the editor "TextMate" then you will know it ;) ]).
It will insert e.g. "source('~/foo.R', chdir=TRUE)" whereby ", chdir=TRUE" is highlight to firstly let the user decide whether it should be used or not. If not simply press DEL key ? and press TAB key ? to go to the end of the inserted template. If the user want to change the value of the parameter 'chdir' simply press the TAB key ? to highlight the next snippet 'TRUE' and press e.g. 'F'. Pressing the keys SHIFT+TAB ?? will highlight ", chdir=TRUE" again. Thus one can navigate through the defined snippets by using the keys TAB ? (next; unless invoked from the last defined snippet) and SHIFT+TAB ?? (prev). Pressing TAB ? from the last defined snippet the cursor will be placed after the entire inserted text template.





In addition the user can define its own dragging template which should be inserted according to a file extension (incl. *.R, *.Rdata to overwrite the default template).

Here a short example:

If you save a file to:

~/Library/Application Support/R/DragActions/tab/command.sh


with following content:


# get the file name
VARNAME=${R_DRAGGED_RELATIVE_FILE_PATH##*/}
# remove extension
VARNAME=${VARNAME%%.*}

# print template
echo -en "\${$R_CURRENT_SNIPPET_INDEX:$VARNAME} <- read.table(file = \"$R_DRAGGED_RELATIVE_FILE_PATH\", sep = \"\${$(($R_CURRENT_SNIPPET_INDEX+1)):\\\t}\", header = \${$(($R_CURRENT_SNIPPET_INDEX+2)):TRUE}, stringsAsFactors = \${$(($R_CURRENT_SNIPPET_INDEX+3)):FALSE})"


then if you drag e.g. the files ~/data/d1.tab and ~/data/d2.tab the following will be inserted:

d1 <- read.table(file = "~/data/d1.tab", sep = "\t", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
d2 <- read.table(file = "~/data/d2.tab", sep = "\t", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

whereby d1/d2 and the values for the parameters sep, header, stringAsFactor are defined as snippets.

The content of the file "command.sh" will be interpreted as a BASH script or if you write the "magic header" like #!/usr/bin/perl as Perl script etc., i.e. one can use any scripting language here. Furthermore R.app will pass shell variables to that script like R_DRAGGED_RELATIVE_FILE_PATH and others on run-time. The output of that script will be then inserted to the dragged destination. This system makes editing in R.app very powerful. 




Documentation and support for other user-defined "normal" text templates like to insert the "foo <- function(x) {}" if you type "fun?" will follow soon.



Many thanks for the hint!

Kind regards,

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] gcc 4.7?
Message-ID: <077C4160-F45A-43F3-8357-A63A00C33963@ed.ac.uk>

Dear OS X folk,

Background: I?m compiling projects which require OpenMP. These crash when linking to the omp libraries included by Apple under llvm, so, wanting to install omp-friendly gcc


Simon[1] has a long list of possible binaries, mostly at gcc 4.2.4

It also has a warning against the hpc[2] binary ?they won?t work correctly!?

But hpc have gcc 4.7, updated for Lion as recently as Feb 2012 (10.7 Lion only) and explicitly suporting OpenMP.

I downloaded and installed this binary: All running fine?

So questions:
1. Is it the case that the hpc binary ?doesn?t work correctly? for R?
2. Is a recommended install that is up to date and robust?

3. Compiling the OpenMx package, all the compile steps run fine, but the make fails on one of the final load checks as follows:

** testing if installed package can be loaded
Error in dyn.load(file, DLLpath = DLLpath, ...) : 
  unable to load shared object '/Users/tim/Library/R/2.14/library/OpenMx/libs/i386/OpenMx.so':

  Referenced from: /Users/tim/Library/R/2.14/library/OpenMx/libs/i386/OpenMx.so
  Expected in: dynamic lookup

Any clues why ?_GOMP_parallel_end? not found?


many thanks

Can you tell us what you're trying to do to use R?

Do you run it through the terminal?
Did you install it using the *.pkg and now the R*.app(s) in your
/Applications folder aren't working?
Are you using RStudio ...

Can you tell us the error message you see?

Hi Dawn,

When replying to R help emails, please "reply all" so that a copy of
the correspondence gets sent back to the mailing list.

Anyway, if we jump to your symptoms:

I wonder if it is trying to load some data file you have previously
saved? This would be in ~/.RData (or is it ~/.Rdata).

Can you open your terminal and run this command:

ls ~/.R*

Do you see any such .RData file there? If so, delete it and try again
to run R again (or just move that file to the desktop if you don't
want to delete it).

Another thing to try while you're in the terminal is to just run R
from inside it to see what's cooking, perhaps like so:

R --vanilla

Does R come up in your terminal?

This is not a R Mac question, and using an informative subject would be a good start.

given names like file1.txt ? file30.txt

cat file2.txt >> file1.txt

will append file2 to file1

A simple bash loop will do it *efficiently*

One can always(?) open a new device using dev.new() which defaults to
the quartz device on my machine.

FWIW, I can get a similar problem with x11 but I have long-standing
troubles with my X11 install that I've never bothered to track down so
I'm not the best test case.

I can open several (I was going to say 'as many as I like", but
that is hard to verify) windows on my setup.  I do have a very
recent update to XQuartz installed: XQuartz 2.7.1_rc2 (xorg-server 1.11.4)
(I have just now been advised of the release of 2.7.1, which I have duly installed.)

I notice the following at http://xquartz.macosforge.org/trac/wiki

"
OS-X Software Updates have included some of the work done by this project, but for various reasons, Apple cannot ship the latest and greatest version offered by this site. Since our package clobbers Apple's X11.app, their SU will clobber ours. Because of this, you may experience conflicts after doing a Software Update from Apple. It is suggested that you install the latest XQuartz release after installing an update to OS-X Leopard.
"

I am running OSX 10.7.3 (Lion).  I have not had any issues with conflicts of which I am aware.

I just tried it on my laptop which has the "old style" x11 installed,  
the one whose icons on the Dock is the plain white one with a grey X,  
and which labels itself XQuartz 2.1.6 (xorg-server 1.4.2-apple33).   
I'm unable to get it to "hang" except for the fact that when the  
window opens, the focus is shifted to that window and typing causes no  
response until one clicks back into the (GUI) console. Repeated  
invocations of x11() without plotting do not cause R to "hang". So I  
guess my only contribution is that an older version of OSX and X11  
does not necessary cause this problem. And I would request a better  
decription of "hang" on Mr Love's part.

Not really a mac question at all.

It isn't an error message either, it is a warning to alert you to the
fact that two objects are now called the same thing and you may not be
seeing the one you originally expected (now that the latter package is
'masking' it)

And in a recent enough version of R you can use one of
boot::melanoma
lattice::melanoma
to select the one you want: the warning is to remind you that you may 
have to.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] How to correctly set up a browser on Mac?
Message-ID: <m24nubtc6g.fsf@77-58-146-142.dclient.hispeed.ch>

Dear Mac-expeRts,

I work with R version 2.14.0 (2011-10-31) (Platform:
x86_64-apple-darwin11.2.0/x86_64 (64-bit)) and recently realized that
help.start() does not work as expected. I soon found out that
options(browser="chrome") in my ~/.Rprofile is not valid, "sh" does not find the
command "chrome". How can I correctly set up Google Chrome as default browser in options()?

Here is what I tried:
I know that on a Mac (MacBook Air with 10.7.3 in my case), one can open
applications via "open -a ...". I tried options(browser="open -a
/Applications/Google Chrome.app") with various forms of escaping the blank, but
it did not work. I then used the following trick. I created a file "mybrowser"
in /bin which contains just this line:
open -a "/Applications/Google Chrome.app"

Now I can open Chrome with no error, but help.start() still did not show any
output. On debugging help.start(), I found out that a simple command such
browseURL("http://www.google.com") makes Chrome "active", but the url is not
visited, so my options-setup of "browser" is certainly wrong.


Cheers,

Marius

Dear Didier,

This line you addressed shows: "Default web browser: Google Chrome.app
(17.0.963)"

How does this help?

If I adjust ~/.Rprofile accordingly (using exactly "Google Chrome.app
(17.0.963)"), I get:

> help.start()
starting httpd help server ... done
If the browser launched by 'Google Chrome.app (17.0.963)' is already
    running, it is *not* restarted, and you must switch to its window.
Otherwise, be patient ...
sh: -c: line 0: syntax error near unexpected token `('
sh: -c: line 0: `Google Chrome.app (17.0.963) "http://127.0.0.1:18864/doc/html/index.html" > /dev/null 2>&1 || Google Chrome.app (17.0.963) "http://127.0.0.1:18864/doc/html/index.html" &'

Hmm,

if I set:

then 

	help.start()

launches Chrome and shows the R Help index page and

	browseURL("http://www.r-project.org")

Message-ID: <alpine.OSX.2.01.1202281612420.1472@qqt.local>


The most recent email on this appears to be https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-mac/2012-January/008967.html

which says, "the most recent GUI is back to the old behavior."

Does this refer to some more recent GUI than the following?

> sessionInfo()
R version 2.14.1 (2011-12-22)

By "the old behavior" does Simon Urbanek mean mean what R used to to from time immemorial, i.e., that hitting ESC would get me out of the current command line, whether I have hit ENTER or not?

To reproduce the problem:

Start at R prompt on a Mac

type: rnorm(100000000000000000) and do not hit enter.

Hit ESC.

I do not get the R prompt. I do not get out of the current command.

Click with the mouse on the STOP button.

I do not get the R prompt. I do not get out of the current command.

How can I get R to behave as it used to behave, with respect to ESC and the STOP key?

Yes (note that message is after the build date you give) - you could build the new GUI yourself tonight, but R 2.14.2 is going out to CRAN tomorrow so I'd just wait for that.

The GUI is a separate build (and install): the current version is almost 
always available from http://r.research.att.com/ .  It has a build 
number (currently 6118) seen when starting R.app: it is good to report 
that as well as sessionInfo().

Whereas the source release of CRAN is due today, binary builds will take 
a little longer (possibly several days, as happened for 2.14.1).

Hi guys,
	does anyone know whether there is a similar function for Mac? I mean... 
is there an winMenuAdd funtion for R users on Mac?
	Thanks in advance,

unfortunately I can confirm this bug for Lion and up. For (Snow) Leopard it works as expected.
I'll see whether I can find out what's going wrong for Lion.

Nevertheless thanks for the report!!!

As far as I know no. But to implement such a feature is quite easy. The only thing I'm concerning about is the naming issue.

For Windows OS there're commands like 'winMenuAdd' etc. i.e. prefixed by 'win'. One could implement this for Mac by using names like 'macMenuAdd' etc. but I think it'd better due to platform independent R scripts to have commands like 'menuAdd' which then dispatches on basis of the running OS and R version the command to 'win...' or 'mac...' or simply ignore it if OS doesn't support such stuff.

The other way would be to adopt the names like 'winMenuAdd' and write a wrapper for R.app for such commands.

Any opinions?

Best,
