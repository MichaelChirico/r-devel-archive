Dear all,

I am a MacOSX/Fink (which is more or less like Debian's APT) maintainer and making R binary. One of the users tried test suite with make -k check and get the following results. Some differences are numerical, while others show sign differences in the result.

Could someone possible explain/fix them?

Thanks

You need to examine the differences, and decide which ones are problems, 
and which ones are inconsequential.  If you think something is a 
problem, then tell us that.

Sometimes numerical differences (including signs) matter, and sometimes 
they don't.

FWIW R built the official way doesn't have such problems, so I would not be surprised that it is an issue with your toolchain and/or the way you build R. Fink 
has been historically known for having issues with compilers (and library mismatches) so I would suggest looking at your end of the affair. For comparison the most recent builds and check results using the official tools are available at
http://r.research.att.com/

Cheers,
Simon

First thing I did was check to see if Arial was already in my list of  
psotscriptFonts:

names(postscriptFonts())  # Nope not there

Then I used the Mac Font Book.app to see if it was on my system. It  
is. (And it's just an ordinary sans serif font, nothing special.)   
Then I right-clicked and asked to show it in the Finder. It is in / 
Macintosh HD/Library/Fonts/Microsoft/ and is named Arial.ttf rather  
than arial.ttf and the names of the italic, bold, and bold-italic  
faces have spaces and are also capitalized.

(Now,  I cannot be sure that you will find such a font on your system.  
I have installed several MS products and it seems possible that this  
font is there only because of that. And I do not know what the  
licensing provisions are.)

I then checked using Terminal.app to see if the utility program you  
were advised to use was on my system:

david-winsemiuss-mac-pro:~ davidwinsemius$ locate ttf2afm
#  It seems to be present as a result of having installed the Tex  
package since all of the directories where it is found are descendants  
of /usr/local/texlive

>   Enable the use of Arial in R
>
>   First, convert the Arial .ttf files to afm:

This is implicitly telling you to do these actions from a system  
window such as you get with Terminal.app

I wish I could report that my efforts at following these instructions  
worked but I get the creation of zero MB files in my ~/ directory

My advice. Use an available sans-serif font. The default sans serif  
font on the R Mac combo is Helvetica but you can ensure its use with....

 > postscript(file="try.ps", horizontal=F,
+       onefile=F,
+       width=4, height=4,
+       family="Helvetica",
+         pointsize=12)
 >   hist(rnorm(100))
 >   dev.off()
null device
           1

If the people at the other end want to use font substitution then that  
should be easily accomplished. There should be enough information in  
the ps file for their software to figure out that you used a 12-point  
sans-serif font.

(This is really a question better posed on the R-Mac-SIG mailing list  
to which I am cross-posting and to which follow-ups should be  
directed ....  without following up to rhelp.)

Message-ID: <C71496B7-9179-4FCD-A468-2CF6C778412A@imperial.ac.uk>

Hi All,

I am building a package on my MBP (latest R, latest OSX, TexLive 2010), and I am incurring in some annoying problems with R CMD check:

* checking PDF version of manual ... WARNING
LaTeX errors when creating PDF version.
This typically indicates Rd problems.
* checking PDF version of manual without hyperrefs or index ... ERROR
Re-running with no redirection of stdout/stderr.
Hmm ... looks like a package
Error in texi2dvi("Rd2.tex", pdf = (out_ext == "pdf"), quiet = FALSE,  : 
 pdflatex is not available
Error in running tools::texi2dvi

My comment is, pdflatex *is* availiable:

$ :/usr/local/texlive/2010/bin/universal-darwin$ ls -l pdflatex 
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  6 21 Oct  2010 pdflatex -> pdftex

and

$ :/usr/local/texlive/2010/bin/x86_64-darwin$ ls -l pdflatex 
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  6 21 Oct  2010 pdflatex -> pdftex

How do I get R CMD check to play nice with my latex installation? I could just ssh the lot to a Linux machine, but that's too much of a defeat...

Best,

Federico

Before anyone asks:

$ :/usr/local/texlive/2010/bin/x86_64-darwin$ ls /usr/texbin/pdflatex 
/usr/texbin/pdflatex

so that's not the issue.

Federico,

both are entirely irrelevant - run
system("pdflatex --version")
in R - that is the only thing that counts. If it shows an error, then you don't have pdflatex on your PATH which would be the problem. As a side note, you are showing two separate TeX packages which may not help you to find out what breaks in your setup in general ...

Cheers,
Simon

thanks for the hint. Unfortunately:

system("pdflatex --version")
/bin/sh: pdflatex: command not found

doing a simple

PATH=$PATH:/user/texbin 

fixed it if I use R and package.skeleton() from the terminal. If I use the R gui (from the standard R 2.13.0 CRAN download) it still does not find pdflatex and does not build a usable package skeleton.

In any case, your hit solved my issue. Now, how do I set the path for the R gui?

When the answer to this is posted, I am wondering if it could be put  
in the Mac R FAQ because it seems that I have read several questions  
of late that involve users puzzling where to set various paths for  
Finder,  bash, and R that are stored in different places/environments.  
It would be good not to need to search for a r-sig-mac posting but  
rather refer to a "central document".

As a matter of completeness, PATH=$PATH:/user/texbin did not alter my path 'globally', and immediately broke in a new terminal tab.  

I solved the issue globally with

sudo sh -c 'echo "/usr/texbin">>/etc/paths.d/texbin' [the reader should be warned I use bash by default on my terminal]

which does work if I use R in a terminal and I call system('pdflatex --version'). This solution also allowed a perfectly clean R CMD check.

On the other hand, from the GUI [R.app GUI 1.40 (5751) x86_64-apple-darwin9.8.0],

Another way to do this would be to change the PATH variable in your
~/.bashrc (or other shell-specific startup file).

I think what you want here is Sys.setenv() in R, e.g.,:
  Sys.setenv(PATH="/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/texbin")

You should be able to set this in your ~/.Rprofile

Hi,

To alter the PATH variables that your GUI apps see, you need to play
with your ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist file -- or apparently even
messing with /etc/launchd.conf (if you launch with spotllight, I
guess).

See here:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/135688/setting-environment-variables-in-os-x

Googling for "environment.plist os x" will also bring in a lot more info.

HTH,
-steve

Well, the R way regardless of where you are is to use .Renviron - that works anywhere including the shell and the GUI. What you set there is really up to you - you can set R_PDFLATEXCMD to be on the safe side or you can set PATH instead.

Simon

But that is largely irrelevant to R. R has its own mechanisms that are well documented in the R documentation, so you can use environment.plist or .profile if you are so inclined, but I would not recommend it, mainly because it will still lead to discrepancies between the GUI and the shell. Moreover, it's not R specific so it will influence other apps that may not expect it. Also it's easy to forget about such things when you are upgrading the system. So, I'm saying just use .Renviron and/or .Rprofile and all is well :).

Cheers,
Simon

I created a .Rprofie with 

Sys.setenv(PATH="/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/texbin") ## as suggested by Martin Ellis [thanks!]

and all is well :)

And note too that this is looking first for a script texi2dvi.  If you 
have that, *it* will look for pdflatex, possibly already knowing where 
to look.

Also note that both the usual texi2dvi and tools::texi2dvi will 
consult environment variables such as PDFLATEX.

If you have a standard Mac TeX installation such as MacTeX, it should 
contain texi2dvi.  So this seems to be entirely a path problem.

while it was entirely a path problem, the latest (2010) MacTex does *not* contain texi2dvi:

which texi2dvi
/usr/bin/texi2dvi

and 

$:/usr/local/texlive/2010/bin/x86_64-darwin$ ls texi*
texindy

but no texi2dvi. I did ask other mactex users and they also do not have texi2dvi

Well, I have texi2dvi and I use MacTex and I am on a fresh install
(new laptop) of snow leopard + latest mactex.  I am using the big
1.6GB "all of mactex" package you can download.

Me too. Have you tried 

which texi2dvi

and 

find /usr/local/texlive/ -name texi2dvi

I do not have a texi2dvi binary in the texlive directory.

Well, I did say it is a script, and on my Mac it is in 
/usr/bin/texi2dvi .

Dear R-guys,

I?d like to send an applescript command to R.app (from Textmate) to clear the console (as is achieved by ?Edit:Clear Console?)

Is there an R function that achieves that, or calls R.app?s menu items?

Best, tim

Hi Tim,
simply call this AppleScript which sends the key equivalent ??L to R.app

tell application "R"
	activate
	tell application "System Events"
		keystroke "l" using {command down, option down}
	end tell
end tell

Cheers,

The texi2dvi issue has been discussed in the past:

http://macosx-tex.576846.n2.nabble.com/Duplicate-texi-executables-on-Leopard-td623925.html


I inspected the macTeX-2010.mkpg with Pacifist. It does not contain the texi2dvi script.
MacTeX uses the latexmk perl script.

/usr/texbin is on my PATH and running which -a texi2dvi gives: /usr/bin/texi2dvi


AFAICT, texi2dvi is Apple provided. It is also quite old (at least if the 2004 refers to texi2dvi):

Running texi2dvi --version in Terminal gives:

texi2dvi (GNU Texinfo 4.8) 1.34

I don't know where the .old versions come from.

Yes, most open-source software on Mac OS X is old.  One issue is 
GPL-3: texinfo was an early adopter, and AFAIR texinfo 4.8 was the 
last GPL-2 release.

My point was (and remains) that if you have your paths set up 
correctly, tools::texi2dvi will use the texi2dvi script and not 
pdflatex directly.  And that this is all in the R-admin manual.

Thanks Hans!
I was hoping to avoid relying on simulating keypresses and the consequent context switch.

but it does the trick, so. 

osascript -e 'on run(theCode)' \
          -e 'tell application "R64" to activate' \
          -e 'tell application "System Events" to keystroke "l" using {command down, option down}' \
          -e 'tell application "TextMate" to activate' \
	  -e 'end run?

Probably best saved as a workflow, to reduce dependency on one editor.
So, as a Services workflow (to install in the new and improved OS X services system)
~/Library/Services

Message-ID: <8B3BC118-0265-436B-B76F-8725997D2FFA@gmail.com>

Dear R mac users,

As services that enforce secure connections like https sftp proliferate, it would be nice if R could handle accessing files over the secure services.

Currently download.file() doesn?t handle https (or anything secure)

The special interest for Mac users is that we have <curl> out of the box. 

I wonder if the download.file() function could be special cased for our platforms that have curl on board and use that?

best wishes,
tim

In 1861, income tax was reduced to ninepence; in 1863 to sevenpence; in 1864 to fivepence; and in 1865 to fourpence. Gladstone believed that government was extravagant and wasteful with taxpayers' money and so sought to let money "fructify in the pockets of the people" by keeping taxation levels down through "peace and retrenchment".

My environment is different to yours, but these may help:

1. Add this line to (or create a new file) ~/.profile

test -d /usr/local/texlive/2010 && PATH=/usr/local/texlive/2010/bin/x86_64-darwin:$PATH &&
                            MANPATH=/usr/local/texlive/2010/texmf/doc/man:$MANPATH

2. Edit R

#!/bin/sh
# Shell wrapper for R executable.

export PATH=/usr/local/texlive/2010/bin/x86_64-darwin:$PATH  # THIS IS THE ADDED LINE

R_HOME_DIR=/sw/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources
if test "${R_HOME_DIR}" = "/sw/Library/Frameworks/lib/R"; then

It already supports curl so why should it special-case anything? If you want to use curl by default (I don't for example) just set the download.file.method option.

download.file() and file() are two entirely independent facilities. file()/url() etc. are connections - and none of them supports https - not even on the Mac. In contrast, download.file() is simply a utility to download a file - it has nothing to do with connections (except for the fact that it may choose to use connections to accomplish the task - or not). You could equally well just call curl yourself -- and in fact that is probably the closest to what you want:

f=pipe("curl -s -S https://rforge.net")
read.table(f)
close(f)

Finally, you may want to have a look at RCurl and getURLContent() and alike.

Cheers,
Simon

I would appreciate help with this problem between Enacs-ESS and R. It's a little off topic.

I am  newbie to Mac OSX and I appear to have lost the connection between ESS and R.  ESS cannot find R. The OS knows where R is  but Emacs-ESS doesn't.  I did have it working initially but must have altered something to   break it.  I am using Vincent Goulet 's build of Emacs/ESS/Auctex.

I know this is not exactly what you asked, but may I suggest homebrew?

http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/

It is a package manager for the Mac, but it compiles almost everything
from source. It can also handle dependencies.

To edit the flags you want to pass to the compiler, you need to edit a
formula, which is a set of instructions on how to compile and install
a given package:

https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/blob/master/Library/Formula/r.rb

Once you have edited the formula, if the defaults were not
satisfactory, you just need to type sudo brew install r in a terminal
and homebrew will take care of the rest.

Best,

Gustavo

The CRAN binary is pretty much as fast at it gets, even with additional flags and/or compilers you won't squeeze much more out of it. The biggest difference is BLAS and you can switch to either of the two that we supply with R or others such as ATLAS or MKL (see the archives of this list). If you have any evidence otherwise, I'd be happy to see it.

It seem you have some really nasty stuff in /usr/local  - possibly from some 3rd party compilers. Under normal circumstances there should be no libgomp in /usr/local. In addition, check your DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH - it should be empty, if it's not, you're asking for trouble.
Either way, you are using non-standard compilers and/or have such in /usr/local. I suspect that is your main problem, but you'd have to tell us more about it.

My suggestion would be for you to rename /usr/local so it doesn't get in the way - I bet R will compile that way (assuming you are using Fortran merged into Xcode). The real fix is to sort out your /usr/local to put it in a more usable state ...

Cheers,
Simon

Thanks Simon: that?s good news (if somewhat hidden?)

But?.
While this works

   secureURL = "https://dl.dropbox.com/s/pl60zb6cljootdj/test.txt?
   download.file(secureURL, "junk.txt", method=?curl?)

This doesn?t?
  
  read.table(secureURL)
  # Error in file(file, "rt") : cannot open the connection
  # In addition: Warning message:
  # In file(file, "rt") : unsupported URL scheme


The reason I thought that curl was explicitly not supported was the Rd help for <file> and <url> in ~/bin/R/trunk/src/library/base/man/connections.Rd

> url and file support URL schemes http://, ftp:// and file://.
and

file() does not support this option, even if download.file() is told too.

If there is a way around this, or file and url can be changed, then I?m happy to submit Rd diffs or other help so people can find this valuable functionality at the  read.xxx level.

Something like 

url and file always support the http://, ftp:// and file:// URL schemes, and may support secure connections (https, sftp etc.).

#ifdef unix
  Secure connections (for instance https://) are supported via use of helpers such as curl which can be set via the <download.file.method> option of download.file.
#endif

With an example of how to do that. Thoughts welcome.

Can you clarify a bit about what you mean when you say "emacs can't
find R" -- how does this happen? When does this happen.

Are yo saying that starting R doesn't work from within emacs, eg: `M-x
R` doesn't work for you?

>From what you are saying, it sounds like a PATH problem ... are you
using a "normal" os-x install of R? If you open a terminal and type
`which R` is it in /usr/bin?

Now from inside emacs, is that location that R is in (here /usr/bin)
found in the PATH that emacs sees? If you do:

M-: (getenv "PATH")

Do you use the appropriate directory where R is in listed in the PATH
that emacs just returned in your minibuffer?

Thanks Jeff,

I have extracted the first 50 lines of the d4 data.frame and put them into the attached d4a.RData file. In case the list handler does not allow attachments I have uploaded a copy of the file onto my web site and it can be downloaded from: http://www.lucameyer.com/d4a.RData

Please notice that what I am trying to do is to aggregate over d4a$progetto and get a sum of d4a$ore. The error I get states:

Error in units == units[1L] : comparison between these types has not been implemented

Can you or anyone on the list spot what the matter could be for me? 

Thanks,
Luca

By trial and error 

aggregate(as.numeric(d4a$ore),list(d4a$progetto),sum)

Message-ID: <4E18A32E.8080109@postgrad.manchester.ac.uk>

Hi there,

I have been trying to run some C code in R. After following various 
instructions on the internet still no avail.
This is what I did:

In the R.c file, I have the following:

==================================
#include <R.h>
#include <math.h>

void last_event_newton( double *time , double *beta0 , double *beta1 , 
double *rho , double *D , double *K , double *L , double *output )
{
     ...not very important code
}
==================================

Then in the terminal (Snow Leopard), I typed:
~ User$ R CMD SHLIB R.c

This is the result:
make: *** No rule to make target `R.o', needed by `R.so'.  Stop.

After googling, I can't find much documentation on this. If anyone can 
help me to figure this out that would be great.

Many thanks
Terry

I replaced "...not very important code" with return;
and named the f.c file lenewton.c.
And then executed R CMD SHLIB lenewton.c in the directory where lenewton.c resides.

No error messages and got  an lenewton.so

Make sure you have all necessary tools (Xcode). If that doesn't help, you'll need to be most specific -- exact version of R, where you got it, Xcode version (gcc --version), and full output (error alone is not very helpful..). As Berend said, what you posted works without problems, so it looks like some issue in your setup.

Cheers,
Simon

Message-ID: <p06240825ca3e893e4be0@[165.124.164.32]>

Simon and the other developers of the wonderful R.Gui for the  Mac,

The following code (anything using mvtnorm) reliably crashes R (under 
development)  when running from the GUI, but not when running  from 
the X11 window or under R-Studio.


  I reported this several months ago but was told to wait for a newer 
release.   I believe I have the latest versions of R (unstable), the 
R GUI, and mvtnorm.

Bill,

I highly doubt that this has anything to do with the GUI as it's not even involved in the trace. Also I can't reproduce it with the latest nightly build even on 10.5.8:

However, you setup seems fishy - there is no 1.41 GUI build for R-devel, so are you sure you installed the correct files? If you are not using the nightly builds, then you will need to provide a lot more detail - compilers used, exact configure, BLAS etc. - and then then you may have to look at the backtrace yourself since the CRAN setup doesn't seem at have that issue.

Cheers,
Simon

Another issue: I believe that tail-area computations in mvtnorm use 
the random number generator: that calculation certainly sets 
.Random.seed.  So to be reproducible, you need to specify the seed.

We've over the years encountered occasional random segfaults in 
mvtnorm on several platforms (certainly x86_64 Linux and both Windows 
builds) that only occur for certain random number seeds.

But I ran that example 1000 times under valgrind (under my own R-devel 
build, which is very similar to the nightly builds), without any 
problem.

Simon,
   As usual, you are right.

It was that I could not get the compiled version of mvtnorm and so 
had downloaded the source.  Because I did not have the correct 
fortran compiler, I could not compile it, so I tried using the 
compiled version from 2.13.  That works for RStudio and R under X11, 
but does not work for R.app Gui (for R unstable).

Following your instructions at the att site (finally), I downloaded 
the GNU Fortran 4.2.4 for Mac OS X 10.6  compiler, downloaded the 
source for mvtnorm,  compiled it, and everything works.

Thanks for the patience, sorry for the noise.

Bill

I would imagine that the two ImageMagick have nothing to do with R, and Tktable might also be unrelated. I am trying to see if any of these files/directoris can be removed, to avoid conflicts with homebrew.

I suppose you mean GNU Fortran - but which one? The recent ones live along Xcode so the answer would be none. If you have the older, separate Fortran then it has an uninstaller script that lists all files - it should be in /usr/local/bin/gfortran-uninstall or you can consult pkgutils (see below).

As for tcltk, this is the list of its files in /usr/local/lib:
Tktable2.9
libtcl8.5.dylib
libtclstub8.5.a
libtk8.5.dylib
libtkstub8.5.a
tcl8
tcl8.5
tclConfig.sh
tk8.5
tkConfig.sh

But in either case, you can check installed files very easily using pkgutil - it is very powerful and can tell you which files are installed by whom and vice versa.
For example:

Fino:~$ pkgutil --file-info /usr/local/lib/tclConfig.sh 
volume: /
path: /usr/local/lib/tclConfig.sh

pkgid: org.r-project.other.tcltk.x11
pkg-version: 8.5.5
install-time: 1224629182
uid: 0
gid: 0
mode: 644

Fino:~$ pkgutil --files org.r-project.other.tcltk.x11
usr
usr/local
usr/local/bin
usr/local/bin/tclsh8.5
usr/local/bin/wish8.5
usr/local/include
usr/local/include/tcl.h
usr/local/include/tclDecls.h
usr/local/include/tclPlatDecls.h
usr/local/include/tclTomMath.h
usr/local/include/tclTomMathDecls.h
usr/local/include/tk.h
[...]


Fino:~$ pkgutil --files org.r-project.mac.tools.gfortran
usr
usr/local
usr/local/bin
usr/local/bin/gfortran
usr/local/bin/gfortran-4.0
usr/local/bin/gfortran-4.2
usr/local/bin/gfortran-uninstall
usr/local/bin/i686-apple-darwin8-gfortran-4.2
usr/local/bin/powerpc-apple-darwin8-gfortran-4.2

Oops - that seems to be wrong due to R-devel failing checks  - so you'll have to wait till tomorrow - I think the issue in R-devel has been fixed in the meantime.

I mean this one:

http://mirrors.dotsrc.org/cran/bin/macosx/tools/

Is this still needed or does the XCode fortran completely replace it?

$ pkgutil --file-info /usr/local/lib/tclConfig.sh 
volume: /
path: /usr/local/lib/tclConfig.sh

is all I get, possibly because my Mac is a 'time machine' installation of an older machine. Similarly:

$ pkgutil --files org.r-project.other.tcltk.x11
No receipt for 'org.r-project.other.tcltk.x11' found at '/'.

$ pkgutil --files org.r-project.other.tcltk.x11
No receipt for 'org.r-project.other.tcltk.x11' found at '/'.

Would it be reasonable to 

1) uninstall gfortran
2) rm -rf /usr/local/lib
3) reinstall from http://mirrors.dotsrc.org/cran/bin/macosx/tools/ both gfortran (if needed) and tcltk and see what happens?

I just realised I should have used this GFortran all along:

http://r.research.att.com/tools/

 gfortran-42-5664.pkg

though I am on XCode 3.2.6, does that matter?

The files are replaced by the nightly build, so there is currently no way to retrieve any old builds (save maybe for archive.org) and I don't keep them around, either. It is something that could be addressed, but then R-devel is supposed to be "under development" so in a sense it's a feature of the branch...

Simon

No, Apple has made no changed to gcc for a while since they stopped using it, so you can safely use it with any recent Xcode 3.2.x version. You don't have to use it, but for SL it is recommended. Don't forget to run "sudo gfortran-uninstall" before you do so you don't have two different Fortran compilers on your machine - just to save some trouble.

Cheers,
Simon

It means that none of them were installed the usual way (via Apple Installer).

Sure, if you have no additional stuff in /usr/local, you can always blow it away.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Tcltk hangs when I invoke RCommander
Message-ID: <CA422A82.28EA%skelton@dickinson.edu>

I am a brand new user of R, running the Macintosh implementation of R.app
2.13.1 on an iMac 21" (3.06 GHz Core 2 Duo) under OS 10.6.8. I have
Administrator privileges on this machine.
Upon invoking library(Rcmdr) , I get the notice that tcltk is being called
up followed by a system prompt (>). However, the X11 window doesn't open,
and nothing at all happens. When I type any legitimate command at the
prompt, this appears in the R Console window:

 *** caught bus error ***
address 0x4, cause 'non-existent physical address'

Traceback:
 1: sys.parent()
 2: sys.function(sys.parent())
 3: formals(sys.function(sys.parent()))
 4: match.arg(encoding)
 5: match(match.arg(encoding), c("", "bytes", "UTF-8"))
 6: textConnection("rval", "w", local = TRUE)
 7: capture.output(print(args(help)))
 8: paste(capture.output(print(args(help))), collapse = "")
 9: gsub("\\s+", " ", paste(capture.output(print(args(help))), collapse =
""))
10: doTryCatch(return(expr), name, parentenv, handler)
11: tryCatchOne(expr, names, parentenv, handlers[[1L]])
12: tryCatchList(expr, classes, parentenv, handlers)
13: tryCatch(expr, error = function(e) {    call <- conditionCall(e)    if
(!is.null(call)) {        if (identical(call[[1L]], quote(doTryCatch)))
         call <- sys.call(-4L)        dcall <- deparse(call)[1L]
prefix <- paste("Error in", dcall, ": ")        LONG <- 75L        msg <-
conditionMessage(e)        sm <- strsplit(msg, "\n")[[1L]]        w <- 14L
+ nchar(dcall, type = "w") + nchar(sm[1L], type = "w")        if
(is.na(w))             w <- 14L + nchar(dcall, type = "b") + nchar(sm[1L],
                type = "b")        if (w > LONG)             prefix <-
paste(prefix, "\n  ", sep = "")    }    else prefix <- "Error : "    msg
<- paste(prefix, conditionMessage(e), "\n", sep = "")
.Internal(seterrmessage(msg[1L]))    if (!silent &&
identical(getOption("show.error.messages"),         TRUE)) {
cat(msg, file = stderr())        .Internal(printDeferredWarnings())    }
 invisible(structure(msg, class = "try-error"))})
14: try(gsub("\\s+", " ", paste(capture.output(print(args(help))),
collapse = "")), silent = TRUE)

Possible actions:
1: abort (with core dump, if enabled)
2: normal R exit
3: exit R without saving workspace
4: exit R saving workspace



I've forwarded the entire core dump to Apple and have a copy of it but
have no idea how to make sense of it.
Odd thing is, this problem doesn't occur on my 2008 Macbook at home, which
runs the same Mac OS. It's peculiar to the iMac at my worksite. As I'm
hoping to use R in some of my advanced undergrad teaching, it'll be
helpful to solve this problem so my students can take advantage of the
RCommander GUI.

Thanks for any light you can shed on this!

Andy,

please check that you have X11 installed. Also see whether clicking on the X11 icon in the GUI toolbar does start X11. Finally, try setting 
Sys.setenv(DISPLAY=":0.0")
before loading tcltk/Rcmdr.

If that doesn't help, please send me the crash log.

Thanks,
Simon

Dear Andy and Simon,

There are installation notes for Mac users of the R Commander at
<http://socserv.socsci.mcmaster.ca/jfox/Misc/Rcmdr/installation-notes.html>.
If after following the steps in the installation notes the Rcmdr still fails
to work, I too would be interested to find that out.

Best,
 John

The second step in those directions was my guess as to the lesion. My  
understanding is that in 10.5 and 10.6 X11 is a default installation.

Dear all,

As a slight addendum, I intend in future to recommend that the Rcmdr be
installed with install.packages("Rcmdr") and then to let it install its own
dependencies on first use; with the current version of the Rcmdr package,
this will cut down on the number of packages installed.

Best,
 John

X11 is installed; the error recurs even when I've opened it myself before
invoking Rcmdr.
In addition, I've installed Rcmdr (and tcltk8.5.5-x11) per the
instructions at John's site (I learned about Rcmdr via Muenchen's "R for
SAS and SPSS Users," which provides the URL).
Simon, I'll forward the crash log to your email address, rather than
posting to the list. Beware: It's very long.

Dear Andy,

If X11 isn't working, then the problem doesn't have to do with the Rcmdr
package or possibly even with R itself. Maybe Simon will be able to suggest
a solution.

I'm sorry that you're experiencing problems. It would be nice if the tcltk
package could work without Tcl/Tk for X11, but if that were simple I suspect
that it would have been done a long time ago.

Best,
 John

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Tcltk hangs when I invoke RCommander

Hi James,

I had a similar problem recently on a freshly installed Leopard system.
After installing R 2.13.0 + tcltk binaries from CRAN (R-2.13.0.pkg +
tcltk-8.5.5-x11.dmg), I started R then tried to load tcltk and this
would hang R. I had to kill the process. I tried again and found that
just doing X11() or even capabilities() would hang it too. I solved the
problem by installing the latest X11 from the XQuartz project.

Cheers,
H.

Why are you installing a 32 bit R?  And why an older version of R?

Can you not install a 64 bit version of the latest R?

Running the ANOVA requires more than 4GB of RAM, which can not be done
with 32 bit versions of software.  So you will need 64 bit R to do this analysis.

What OS version is on your server?  If it's an old 32 bit version, upgrading the server
to a recent 64 bit OS will help.  Then install a recent 64 bit version of R.

If you can do this, you can better assess whether this analysis can be done 
faster on the 8GB laptops.

R runs entirely in RAM, so if the analysis needs more than 8GB of RAM, you may
be experiencing "swapping" on the laptops.  The operating system allocates
as much memory as the job needs - if that amount of memory exceeds the amount
of RAM you have, then the rest is allocated to "virtual memory" which is
on the disk drive.  Swapping occurs when part of the virtual memory of your job
that is on disk is needed - the OS has to copy a chunk of what is in RAM out to
disk, so it can copy the other chunk on disk back into RAM.

Monitor the laptop with a shell command line process such as "top" 
and you will be able to determine how much virtual memory your R job
is using, and how many "swaps" are involved.  Swapping really slows things
down as reading and writing from the disk is slow.  If your job is swapping
on the laptop, but uses less than 13GB of memory in total, it will run faster
on the server.  If the job is not swapping at all on the laptop,  it will not
run appreciably faster on the server.

FWIW: you can run R in 64-bit on Tiger as well, you just have to disable Quartz and the GUI since Tiger doesn't have 64-bit Cocoa.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] GUI bracket-matching and window positioning
Message-ID: <4E1F0BB3.30905@ich.ucl.ac.uk>

A couple of queries-comments about the Mac gui.

1. I'm curious what determines where new editor and quartz windows are 
positioned. Usually editor windows appear in the middle of my screen, 
and successive windows in the session shift down and to the right. My 
impression is that the last window position is remembered between 
sessions. Is there a way to reset the position of the initial window?

2. Quartz windows always open bottom left on my screen, irrespective of 
the preference setting. I've mentioned this before, but the behaviour 
has not changed. Am I altering the preference setting incorrectly, or is 
it broken?

3. I'm much enjoying the new gui editor. I've noticed that the following 
arcane bit of code defeats the bracket balancer, because some of the 
brackets are quoted and others aren't. Note that all the quote 
characters are single quotes.

     b <- 'b+c'
     paste('(a', ifelse(!is.null(b), paste('-(', b, '))', sep=''), ')'), 
sep='')

My setup:
R version 2.13.1 (2011-07-08)
[R.app GUI 1.41 (5874) i386-apple-darwin9.8.0]

Hi Tim,

thanks for the report.

For R Script Editor windows we're using Cocoa's default setting of remembering the last opened window position. It's not ideal but we're working on a better solution including the chance to ignore remembering the last position.

Unfortunately it seems that this setting is broken. We're trying to fix it.

This was fixed in revision 5879 :)

Are we? ;) This setting was for the old Quartz device (long time ago). It has no effect for the new Quartz device which is provided by R and not the GUI - in fact that device doesn't even have an option for placement (partially because the new Quartz device is backend-agnostic so such setting makes no sense in general - let's say for PDF output). Because the new Quartz device is part of R, this won't change until both the GUI and R agree on some way to communicate the setting.

There are two issues here: the preference pane setting should go since it has no effect. As for Quartz, it should allow a way to set the window location and probably use something analogous to the Cocoa default setting except we can't let it set the size (because that is set by the quartz() function).

Cheers,
Simon

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] R-Gui with remote execution?
Message-ID: <2DB17D64-824C-46A6-B498-4DF7C284F966@alumni.rice.edu>

We have three Macs, one with considerably more storage and 
processor power.  Storage requirements are probably most
important to us.

Is there a way to run R-Gui on one mac but have the
execution on a remote mac?  (I know that voluminous
graphics are probably best transmitted using pdf files or
the like.)

If not, is there a favorite way to run remotely using X11
better than the paste-from-editor command-line interface?

I also use Vim-R myself, so there may be a way to exploit
vim.

(I've checked for messages on the subject for the last few
years.)

Running R version 2.10.1 on 10.6.7 locally and 10.5.8 remotely.

Currently, no. The closest you can get is to use Remote Desktop.

However, I have a situation here where we have very powerful Linux servers (hundreds of cores, TB of RAM) yet I want to use the convenience of my Mac and Quartz. To achieve that I'm working on a Mac GUI that can connect to any remote instance of R running on an arbitrary machine. The idea is that you need only a single stream (e.g. ssh) to talk to R and yet have console, graphics and everything on the Mac side. Another side-effect is that you can connect and disconnect without losing the session. The project (RemoteR) is far from complete (I still need to tie-in Quartz) but if anyone becomes excited it's available on RForge.net: http://svn.rforge.net/osx/trunk/RemoteR

I suppose most people use emacs + ESS so you don't need to copy/paste ;) -- I'm not sure whether Apple emacs supports X11, you may have to compile it from sources.

BTW: pdf is exactly the wrong way to do that ;)

Also I forgot to mention that there are some GUI projects that separate the UI and the R process. Byron Ellis had some UI a while ago that was Mac specific so presumably could be used across Mac machines. RStudio also separates R and the UI so presumably you could run it across machines (also it ships bitmap files instead of graphics so it should be efficient) - but I have never tried it that way.

Cheers,
Simon

There is also Rstudio that can be run either in server mode, or over an X windows connection. It will run an embedded instance of R and provides a window for graphics, a console, and a widow for editing. It's another decent alternative.

Not sure if this is all the support you were referring 
to, but I use Carbon Emacs from
http://homepage.mac.com/zenitani/emacs-e.html
and can invoke e.g. X11() and plot to the X11 device
(Mac OS X 10.6.7).

No. I was talking about the inverse - i.e. emacs that can run on X11 so you can tunnel it through SSH since Bob will be running emacs on the remote machine, not the local one. You can't tunnel Cocoa/Carbon so Carbon Emacs is useless for that purpose (unless it's compiled with X11 support besides Carbon...).

You can't tunnel Cocoa/Carbon so Carbon Emacs is useless for that purpose (unless it's compiled with X11 support besides Carbon...).

I run R within Aquamacs (a Cocoa version of Emacs). By invoking a shell (M-x shell), then ssh -Y me at servername I can start R on my server and send lines of R code across after "M-x ess-remote". New graphs open in a X11 window. I plot final versions to pdf and rsync these back to my mac. This way I can have all my scripts locally and enjoy the benefits of Aquamacs. 

For jobs that take hours to run I rsync scripts and data to the server and execute with nohup. 

HTH,
Martin

Just to elaborate on the RStudio a bit more ... I actually don't use
it, but it sounds like it really provides what you are after.

Look at the "RStudio Server" section in the docs here:
http://rstudio.org/docs/

R will be running on a remote machine (presumably your
?ber-high-horsepower mac), and the clients will connect to it using
their browser, and the interface (I think) is quite similar to the
"normal" RStudio one running on your own machine.

Also, people are running rstudio on large EC2 instances with success
as well, for example:

http://inundata.org/2011/03/30/r-ec2-rstudio-server/

Hope that helps,
-steve

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Problem using aspell
Message-ID: <4E2587CC.1040008@gmail.com>

Hello,

I've recently installed the package Aspell, it appears the install went 
just fine. but when I try to use aspell I get the following error,

 > aspell("love")
Error in getSpeller() :
   No word lists can be found for the language "en_US".


I also installed aspell and hunspell seperately using GitHubs homebrew.  
I'm a bit of a newbie when it comes to installation subtles from sources 
files.  Any help would be much appreciated.

Best,

-Chris

  Before we jump into this, it would also be nice if you could sendthe
results of sessionInfo() from both a (minimal) working 2.12.x session
and a (minimal) non-working 2.13.x session -- I suspect a change in
packages, or that you haven't reinstalled some packages, or something
like that.

hi Hans,

Prompted by a "tim" posting (cole not me) email on the list, I thought I'd send in my wish list even though it's not christmas :-) Thanks for the massive improvements you've made already - they save me around 1hr a day, I think! Hope other people are discovering them: Maybe R could have a "tip of the day" bubble, like TextMate :-)

1. Package Manager
a. Allow sort by "loaded"
b. A grep filter would be amazing!

2. Workspace Browser
a. Allow sort by structure (by kb/product of dimensions..?)
b. Allow selection of multiple items
  1. cmd-shift down extends selection
  2. cmd-click extends selection
c. Broom: allow the follow delete behaviors
  1. cmd-click on broom deletes without confirmation
  2. delete key = delete with confirmation
  3. cmd-delete = delete without confirmation

3. Preferences: Quartz
a. Bind ?tab? key to  move focus from height->width->pixels fields


Best wishes,
tim bates

Message-ID: <930D5B8F-50CB-44B3-91B1-F7A6CFC2528B@att.net>

Dear R-SIG-Macers,

I am a very newbie for compilation of packages.  I usually rely on  
binaries in CRAN.  I need to compile a package under Mac OS 10.5.8.   
My questions are: a) Where do I put the .tar.gz file to compile and b)  
What are the exact command line instructions from the R.app GUI? I  
have RTM and I am lost as to what to do.

Particulars of my system:

Mac PowerPC with 1.8 GHz Processor and 1.5 GB Memory
XCode 3.1.4
GNU Fortran 4.2.3
Tcl/TK latest.

Output from sessionInfo()

R version 2.13.1 (2011-07-08)
Platform: powerpc-apple-darwin9.8.0/ppc (32-bit)

locale:
[1] en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/C/C/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8

attached base packages:
[1] stats     graphics  grDevices utils     datasets  methods   base

Thanks in advance,

Put the .tar.gz file anywhere where R can see it and read it.  For 
example, after starting R.app if you run getwd() you'll probably see 
something like

/Users/<yourname>

Putting the tar.gz in that directory is simplest.  Then

install.packages("<path to the .tar.gz>", type="source", repos=NULL)

will attempt to install it.

If it's a simple package, that should just work; if it has compiled C or 
Fortran code, you may need to install some compilers to get it to work. 
  See the links from http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/ for how to 
get those for your particular version of OS X.

Message-ID: <B42C6E0E-935B-4C3D-8F3A-BA75AAC2DA74@pitt.edu>

Hi, Hans,

Got another "curiosity" for you!

A changed behavior  in the new interface:

Type some command in the console, e.g.  date().
Now up-arrow, and Enter.
Repeat.
Each time, an extra newline is added before pressing Enter.
The newlines begin to pile up.

(If one is successively editing then trying a command,
this gets slightly tedious.)

I'm curious if this is intentional and if so, what's the rationale.

Check "cleanup history entries" in the Preferences if you don't like this. It is in fact the default AFAIR so I'm not sure why it's disabled for you.

I'd agree with Tim, I'm saving a great deal of time with the recent GUI improvements - I love the ability to run from the help window!

I was wondering (and it may be a feature already) if there is any way to stop the focus shifting from the console window to the plot window when a new plot (quartz) is started? It seems to be a part of plot.new(), so maybe it isn't a GUI issue, but just clicking the quartz button in the gui doesn't do it. I'm probably the only person in the world who finds this a problem, but for some reason in my workflow it can be a blocker when the focus shifts but I'm still trying to feed commands in.

cheers

Ben

Message-ID: <462FA5D8-E30A-469E-BBB4-62F7AF4889F2@ed.ac.uk>

Dear Mac R users,

Not sure if this is mac/quartz specific or not.

With my default graph size (about 3*3 inches), this code:

layout(matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 3), 2, byrow = TRUE))
plot(1:10); plot(11:20); plot(21:40)


Gives the error "Error in plot.new() : figure margins too large?:

If I expand the quartz window, run the code (error free), then reduce the window (generating an in window ?margins" error message), then expand again: it redraws itself just fine.

Question: Why doesn?t the code execute the same way when the window is initially too small? (i.e., draw into a window minimally big enough to allow the scaled graph to be rendered, then try rendering in the desired window, keeping the plot code intact and making an in-window error if necessary)?

best, tim

The error comes from R, not Quartz. There is a big difference between a redraw and rerun: when you resize R just re-plays the display list, it doesn't create any new objects. When you rerun you are creating new graphics objects and R refuses to do so if your plot window is to small. This makes sense, because redraw doesn't change the layout according to the window dimensions while rerun does. That's why typically it's a bad idea to draw a plot and then resize the window without rerunning the code since the result will look different (worse).

Cheers,
Simon

Hi Chris

 You need to install the aspell dictionaries for Aspell
to work.

Thanks that did it.  I thought when I used the installer brew (like 
macports) with the option --lang=en_US, that it put it in.  Anyways, 
thanks for responding.

Message-ID: <F48F7E5B-0808-485E-8A7E-891F212FB2A3@r-project.org>

Since I got a few private e-mails concerning Lion, this is just to say that nothing changed since the last Lion post here a while ago (you'll still have to open Quartz explicitly in command line R).
R works out of the box and you have the choice of using the CRAN Fortran (/usr/local) or the Xcode 4.1 add-on.

In addition, Lion users are encouraged to install R 2.13.1 from CRAN (or re-install if you upgraded from SL) since it is Lion-aware (yes, even though it was released before Lion ;)). It re-enables vecLib BLAS as it seems the Mac Pro issue has been fixed in Lion.

Cheers,
Simon

Just as a note: I installed the fortran compiler from

http://r.research.att.com/tools/

(the gfortran 4.2.3)

and, on my SL machine it was installed in /usr/bin, not /usr/local:

pkgutil --file-info /usr/bin/gfortran
volume: /
path: /usr/bin/gfortran  <<<<<<<---- *not /usr/local/*

pkgid: org.r-project.gnuFortran42.usr.pkg
pkg-version: 5664
install-time: 1310405109
uid: 501
gid: 0
mode: 755

does this apply to gfortran and tcl/tk, i.e. should they be reinstalled?

Yes, obviously, since you installed the Xcode add-on, not the CRAN Fortran. Also this is somewhat off-topic since my post was about Lion ...

I was browsing the opensource packages  for Xcode 4.1 and I notice that LLVM-gcc sources seem to include gfortran.  Whereas the gcc sources do not.

However, I have installed Xcode 4.1 on Lion and it does not include gfortran.

Has anyone tried building LLVM-gcc gfortran  on Lion?

I did not - I built the regular gcc-42 fortran as we did for SL (it's available from the usual place). Anecdotal evidence from the Web suggests that the LLVM Fortran produces slower code than the gcc Fortran. However, if you build LLVM Fortran, let me know how it goes and if it's not too painful I will try to compare both of them.

Hi all,

I installed the RSwitch app RSwitch-1.2.dmg  from http://r.research.att.com/#other
and installed R-2.13.1 R-2.13-branch-leopard.pkg  from http://r.research.att.com

Before installing R-2.13.1 I ran the "forget" command

$ sudo pkgutil --forget org.r-project.R.Leopard.fw.pkg
Password:
Forgot package 'org.r-project.R.Leopard.fw.pkg' on '/'.

then ran the installer.  R-2.13.1 starts up when I invoke R.app.

I ran the RSwitch app, selected R-2.12.1 and when I start R.app I see

Error in matrix(NA_character_, 0L, 3L) :

I am unclear as to why I am seeing R-2.13.1 after attempting to switch back to R-2.12.1.

Any one else having this issue?

Did I miss some part of setting this up appropriately?

Any info appreciated.

On restarting R, with RSwitch still pointed at R-2.12.1, I get a command prompt
after the error messages above.  Entering searchpaths() I see

I think I've figured this out.

I see that one instance of R.app in the Applications folder
is not workable when using RSwitch.  I copied the R.app from 
R-GUI-5732-2.12-leopard-Leopard64.dmg to a folder, renamed
it R-2.12.2_64bit.app, then moved it to the Applications folder.
I copied R.app from R-GUI-5885-2.13-leopard-Leopard64.dmg to a folder,
renamed it R-2.13.1_64bit.app, then moved it to the Applications folder.

Now if I run the appropriate R-<version>.app after switching via
RSwitch.app, the Mac R GUI initialization and startup is all fine.

Apologies for the noise.

I actually seem to have a veclib problem. I have just upgraded to Lion from 
Snow Leopard on my MacBook Pro 15'', medio 2009 and done a fresh install of 
R 2.13.1 and the latest gfortran 4.2.3 from att.research. Unfortunately I am 
not able to make a reproducible example of the problem without my own package 
which is not on CRAN (yet). The problem is only present when I use vecLib and 
not when using the reference Blas (I also checked on Linux and Win and it 
worked fine). I had no problems under Snow Leopard. Here are the details: I 
install by R CMD INSTALL without errors but when I try to load the package by 
library(civecm) I get

Error in dyn.load(file, DLLpath = DLLpath, ...) : 
  unable to load shared object 
'/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.13/Resources/library/civecm/libs/

The civecm.so exists and is created from Fortran code using both BLAS and

relevant information.

I have just installed R 2.13.1 on a clean install of Lion on a 3 year old iMac with a 2GHz Core 2 Duo. When I run R in the terminal and use the x11 device I get some strange behaviors when I call the dev.off() function. If I plot several times then usually I get the error:

    Error in dev.off() : parameter "i" in "mfg" is out of range

and if I plot only once I get the warning:

    Warning message:
    In dev.off() : Display list redraw incomplete

In both cases, a new x11 window opens (not exactly the expected result of dev.off). Steps to reproduce both cases are given below.

Also, it seems that the x11 device is not 3-4 times faster than the quartz device. Has anyone else noticed this?

Cheers,
Kjell

This is not peculiar to Lion: it does seem something about Apple's X11 
notifier and I've seen it quite often over the years on Leopard ...

Why would you expect it to be?  X11(type='Xlib') is, but that is no 
longer the default on OS X.

I had a typo in my original post, fixed below.

Oops!  That was supposed to say "the x11 device is now 3-4 times faster than the quartz device."  Anyway, here are the timings I get (I expected quartz to be the fastest but not for any particular reason):

   user  system elapsed 
  0.191   0.025   0.496

It seems the BLAS path is incomplete. Please run otool -L on your .so -- if compiled correctly you should see something like

ginaz:library$ otool -L KernSmooth/libs/x86_64/KernSmooth.so
KernSmooth/libs/x86_64/KernSmooth.so:
	KernSmooth.so (compatibility version 0.0.0, current version 0.0.0)
	/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.13/Resources/lib/libRblas.dylib (compatibility version 0.0.0, current version 0.0.0)
	/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.13/Resources/lib/libgfortran.2.dylib (compatibility version 3.0.0, current version 3.0.0)
	/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.13/Resources/lib/libR.dylib (compatibility version 2.13.0, current version 2.13.1)
	/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreFoundation.framework/Versions/A/CoreFoundation (compatibility version 150.0.0, current version 476.19.0)
	/usr/lib/libgcc_s.1.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.0.0)
	/usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 111.1.5)

If in doubt, compile your package with reference BLAS and then switch to vecLib BLAS - I suspect that will work.

Cheers,
Simon

I do see the same issue in my GUI (R 2.13.1 reinstalled on Lion), though I noticed when I load files with load:

load('pre') becomes
load('preliminary.RDataliminary.RDataliminary.RData') 


rather than

load('preliminary.RData')

From the machine on which I'm testing Lion with R-2.13.1, Xcode4.1 and gfortran-lion-5666-3
(I have deleted the Copyright notices)

[.../R]: gcc --version
i686-apple-darwin11-llvm-gcc-4.2 (GCC) 4.2.1 (Based on Apple Inc. build 5658) (LLVM build 2335.15.00)

[.../R]: gfortran --version
GNU Fortran (GCC) 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5666) (dot 3)

[.../R]: ls -l /usr/bin/gcc*
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel      12 25 Jul 14:44 /usr/bin/gcc -> llvm-gcc-4.2

I can't remember if I installed gfortran first or Xcode.
I have run R CMD check on my package nleqslv which executed all ok.
I see from the file 00install.out that R runs gcc-4.2 and gfortran-4.2.

Same here:

gcc-4.2 --version
i686-apple-darwin11-gcc-4.2.1 (GCC) 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5666) (dot 3)

hence I am puzzled why I should not be able to install.

Wrong reason. The only reason it won't install on Lion is if you don't have gcc-42 in the system location. The high-level check is that this must work:

ginaz:Lion$ /usr/bin/gcc-4.2 --version
i686-apple-darwin11-gcc-4.2.1 (GCC) 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5666) (dot 3)
Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
This is free software; see the source for copying conditions.  There is NO
warranty; not even for MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.


The actual test is that /usr/libexec/gcc/i686-apple-darwin11/4.2.1/cc1 must be present:

ginaz:Lion$ ls -l /usr/libexec/gcc/i686-apple-darwin11/4.2.1/cc1
-rwxr-xr-x@ 1 root  wheel  12486976 Jul 22 18:55 /usr/libexec/gcc/i686-apple-darwin11/4.2.1/cc1

The reason is that the package will update it so if you don't have it, you don't have Xcode in the right place so it won't work.

Simon

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] View large quartz windows using R GUI
Message-ID: <4E2E45BC.7060103@anu.edu.au>

Hello,

I'm using Mac OS 10.6.8, R 2.13.1, R.app GUI 1.41

I have searched for help on this and found only midly related topics 
(http://tolstoy.newcastle.edu.au/R/help/05/10/13563.html ,  
http://tolstoy.newcastle.edu.au/R/help/05/10/13561.html , 
http://tolstoy.newcastle.edu.au/R/e4/devel/08/05/1528.html). One thread 
deals with a similar question 
(http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.r.mac/4086/focus=4103), but 
doesn't quite solve my problem.

I would like to make a layout with several plots on a page that is 
approximately A4 sized. If I draw all of the plots and save them without 
resizing the window it comes out at the right size. But I need to be 
able to see the layout on the page as it will appear on the PDF so that 
I can work on getting it how I want it. There is no way to scroll down 
and see the bottom of the window, and I don't know of a way I can change 
the view of the quartz window without changing the actual size of the 
image. Any size greater than the default seven inches is not visible on 
the screen without resizing the window and distorting the proportion and 
changing the size.

quartz(title="Fig.1",width=8.27,height=11.69)
par(mfrow=c(3,2))
plot(1,2)
plot(2,3)
plot(3,4)
plot(4,5)
plot(5,6)
plot(6,7)

The obvious solution is to make the quartz window proportionally smaller 
and then resize it later. The other solution is to make all the plots 
separately first and then put them on the one page, but I want to see 
the whole page so I can customise the margins etc. Is there a way to 
change the view of the quartz window without changing its size?

Thanks,
Annabel.

Hi Bj?rn,

I just upgraded to Lion and installed also R 2.13.1.

Since the upgrade, the command autocompletion in the R.app GUI 
behaves weird. If i press autocompletion lets say after the third 
character of a six character long command, it will complete
the command plus additionally add the three last characters
of the command in the end. This error does not appear when I
start R in the console or when i use it in Aquamacs/ESS.

Does anyone has an idea how to solve this problem?

Best regards
Lorenz

Yes, set the dpi to something lower than your actual screen - that will allow you to see the whole page even on a smaller screen, e.g.:

quartz(title="Fig.1",width=8.27,height=11.69, dpi=70)

Spinning wheel means that R has entered C code that is not interruptible. It's no different from the Windows version except that Windows GUI doesn't even have the indicator.

If you are running a script (interpreted code), you can interrupt it with <Esc> or the Stop button and there is no spinning wheel.

There are various reasons:

1) Big job  .. takes time. 5-10 minutes for some of mine. I even have  
ones that take 45 minutes to an hour.
2) variant of 1) Physical memory  exhausted, virtual memory being  
used, performance becomes 10-20 times slower.
In that instance it is useful to open the Activity Monitor.app in  
your /Applications/Utilities folder. I keep it on my Dock, where it  
displays memory availablity. I then know if virtual memory is getting  
accessed and can then go get another cup of coffee.
3) Program bug, enters loop, lost connection with your OS, refuses to  
respond to <esc> or Stop button,  needs to have "Force Quit" from the  
Finder.

> Is there a different recommended way to develop, test, and run  
> scripts on the Mac version?

Most of the cognoscenti seem to use emacs and Sweave/LaTex, although  
there are other smart  people using Eclipse and an increasing number  
using RStudio. Both of the first failed , in the first case (emacs)  
due to my inability to adapt to the new keystrokes and getting stuck  
in buffers that I could not exit,  and in the case of Eclise/StatET  
due to inadequate directions to support installation. (I do read  
manuals and follow directions reasonably well but they need to have  
_all_ the steps and at least when StatET was being rolled out, there  
were definitely missing steps. I am a Unix-weenie, so some steps that  
would seem second nature to the *Nixerati are not in my repertoire. It  
is useful to have some Unix commands like locate, ls, and cd, and it  
is very useful to discover that dragging files to the Terminal.app  
command line will auto-compose a full file-path spec. )  Rstudio looks  
nice except Simon and Hans-Peter have continued to improve the R-GUI  
and I like it.  I regularly save a console transcript, edit out the  
errors and also same my useful work to text files or to spreadsheet.  
The RGUI for the Mac allows  you to do your editing in separate files  
now with an auto-save option that is very handy. You can select and  
hit cmd-return and get transfer to and immediate execution in the  
Console.

Now, if I do need to force quit, at least I recover my code that has  
been saved in another place.

I use TextMate ( http://macromates.com/ ) and the R bundles developed by Hans-J?rg Bibiko a lot.
Very nice.

Thank you David and Simon for quick responses. I was hoping that I might have made some usage error that you had seen before.  looks like I will have to dig deeper.

This is not a big job - yet.  I am just starting with simple intro lines:  library function, setting some file path names, and setting color scheme variables.  Code that works fine in my windows R project. No loops in my code, but there might be in the package functions. Not the point when I would go for a cup of coffee.

Plenty of memory.  Activity monitor shows maybe 63MB for R64 app and over 5 G free. R64 uses 45% of cpu.

Esc and R console stop button do not interrupt the process - consistent with  what Simon wrote: "Spinning wheel means that R has entered C code that is not interruptible."  The activity monitor says "not responding".  I have to kill it with the activity monitor.  Then the system produces a forced quit problem details report which I can mail if that is of any use.  It describes the event as "hang".

I am using the text editor that comes with the r.app gui.  I wasn't aware of Rstudio and will see if I have better success with that. 

My intuition is that the r app gui is having problems with multi line paste of script, but your comments point to some error in the user code.

My script is simple, but it occurs to me that one of the packages might be a potential problem source.  I'll try testing them one at a time and see if that pinpoints a problem. And, I'll let you know if I make progress.  thanks

Rick

Hello,

I should have loaded RStudio before responding.  My intro code runs fine within RStudio. 
Now I can get to the cup of coffee stage.

Thanks Thanks

Hey all,

I upgraded the other day to Lion. Everything works well and R is very happy in the terminal, however the gui has some problems. I use autocomplete a lot and the autocomplete is messing up. I don't know really how to describe it but basically it's doubling up and not removing the previously listed names. For example it ends up looking something like this:


".dvdcss/dvdcss/DS_Storedropbox/cytoscape/cups/cpan/config/CFUserTextEncodingcache/bash_profilebash_historyadobe/adobe/"

Where each of these are a correct directory off of the users except the first letter is missing. Has anyone found a fix for this or do we have to wait for the new Rgui? I'm currently using : [R.app GUI 1.42 (5885) x86_64-apple-darwin9.8.0]

Cheers,

Paul

We would appreciate if you could pinpoint the issue, though, so if it's really R.app's fault, we'd like to fix it ...
Can you send me the script in question or something like that?

Thanks,
Simon

This should be now fixed in R.app GUI rev. 5888. The binary should be up by tomorrow at http://r.research.att.com
