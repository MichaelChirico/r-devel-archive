I am not a regular user of that facility and cannot see that it has  
much value over the facilities available in the console. Nontheless, I  
can replicate the error, but not the hang behavior on a relatively  
current 64 bit R installation run from the 64 bit GUI:

 > dput(data2)
structure(list(Id02 = structure(c(1L, 2L, 3L, 3L), .Label = c("1.a",
"2.b", "3.d"), class = "factor"), Area = c(10, 2, 3, 5)), .Names =  
c("Id02",
"Area"), row.names = c(NA, -4L), class = "data.frame")

 > edit(data2)
# choosing the "+" icon in the edit window results in this message in  
the GUI console window
Error in edit.data.frame(data2) :
   SET_VECTOR_ELT() can only be applied to a 'list', not a 'character'

David,

this was fixed in the recent GUI as the thread you replied to says.  
Please update your GUI to 5450 or later.

Cheers,
Simon

Thanks. It does indeed fix the problem that I did not know existed.  
May I inquire what is really happening? The help page for utils:: edit  
suggests to me that the dataframe is being sent to "vi" ( == "vim" on  
my installation),  but that certainly does not look like a vim window.

edit is a generic function (see the doc) - in your case you want to  
read rather ?edit.data.frame which is implemented differently  
depending on the GUI used allowing a spreadsheet-like interface.

Cheers,
Simon

@Tracy: what you were probably looking for is the fix() function

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] R crashes with "caught segfault" under Mac OS X
Message-ID: <3509B7DD-A147-4412-A928-6E2C4087C9F8@anne-skoeries.de>

Hallo there,

I'm developing under Mac OS X.
I'm generating a plot out of a tcl/tk-application. The plot is shown  
as expected in a Quartz-window in front of the tcl/tk-window but the  
focus strangely remains on the X11 application (tcl/tk-window).  If I  
close the Quartz-Window by clicking on the red "close-button" directly  
without changing the focus by clicking the Quartz-window, R crashes  
with the following error-messages shown below.

My questions:
1. Is there a way to prevent the crash?
2. Is it possible to change the focus automatically to the Quartz- 
window? If not, is there a way to show the plot within a tcl/tk-window  
and completely abstain from a Quartz-window?

Code:
tt <- tktoplevel()
buta <- tkbutton(tt, text = "ajcc0", command = function()  
{barplot(height = mat, names.arg=namen)})
tkgrid(buta)

error message:
*** caught segfault ***
address 0xc5f003f3, cause 'memory not mapped'

Possible actions:
1: abort (with core dump, if enabled)
2: normal R exit
3: exit R without saving workspace
4: exit R saving workspace

Install the package gtools. In future, when installing a package ask for
all packages it depends on to be installed.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Package Installer of R 2.9.1 (64 bit)?
In-Reply-To: <mailman.23.1249552806.17039.r-sig-mac@stat.math.ethz.ch>
Message-ID: <C6A06DEE.718F%dds@stowers.org>

Hello all


First post here. Warning: I'm an IT sys admin, not a programmer or developer. I'm a tad confused on the 32 bit vs. 64 bit versions of R for Mac OS X (x86). Looking for some clarification.

I'm looking for a current (stable) 64bit version of R to run on a 2009 Intel Serve. I will be using it with Bioconductor. My users will be running R from the command line or X11 via SSH primarily (i.e.; not from the Aqua console GUI). Even though I may not need to use a 64bit version of the R GUI, Id like to have it installed just in case.

I see that there is a .pkg  installer for R 2.9.1 available as a .dmg, but it appears to be a 32bit. Is there not a 64 bit version available in a .pkg installer format as well? If not, do I need to compile a 64bit version from source? I'm curious as to why there isn't a 64 bit version in .pkg format.

Looking around the 'Net, I did find what appears to be a 64 bit version of R, but its a little older version  - 2.9.0 (Its under the "Leopard Build" section on this page: http://r.research.att.com/ ) I'm curious as to why there is a 64 bit version of 2.9.0 (app & GUI) available, but there isn't one available for 2.9.1.

I know this has been discussed in the past, but I just want to clarify. I have seen posts in this list back in June/July 2009. At that time there was a discussion of installing R 2.9.1 64 bit app and then retro-fitting it with a stand-alone version of the 64 bit GUI. Is this still the best way to do this? Or has someone put together an installer with the 64 bit app (2.9.1) and a 64 bit version of the GUI?

My goal is to get the most recent version of R (64 bit) installed. If I have to compile/install R from source that's fine, but Id like to make the process as painless as possible.

Any words of wisdom would be appreciated.


Thank you!

-Dan

Currently, no, but you can install the 2.9.0 one and update to 2.9.1  
using nightly the tarball from
http://r.research.att.com/

No

The new PackageMaker in Leopard is incompatible with the old one used  
to build the installation packages for Tiger. Also there are issues  
with the way it collects the resources to be installed, so it doesn't  
work properly in automated environments. The bottom line is that  
the .pkg for 2.9.0 was created manually and I didn't have the time to  
do that same for 2.9.1 (too many conferences etc.).

Yes, there is:
as of today: R 2.9.1 Patched (2009-08-05)
http://r.research.att.com/R-2.9-branch-leopard-universal.tar.gz

(just unpack using sudo tar fxz R-2.9-branch-leopard-universal.tar.gz - 
C / )

Corresponding 64-bit GUI:
http://r.research.att.com/R-GUI-5455-2.9-leopard-Leopard64.dmg

Corresponding 32-bit GUI:

Not yet. The easiest is probably to install the 2.9.0 package and then  
unpack the tar ball to update it. The GUI didn't change from 2.9.0 to  
2.9.1, but there was a fix few days ago, so just take the most recent  
and you're set.

Cheers,
Simon

Ehm - when you really have to cross-post, you should retain enough  
information so it's clear what the thread is all about. What you  
posted here is just plain spam without any content ... not helpful to

The night build page <http://R.research.att.com/>, conveniently
include a dmg build of R-devel (2.10).   However, I notice that the
current dmg, is from a revision 48594, which is May I believe.  Would
it be possible have a more recent revision package as a dmg?

Also, what is the preferred method of installing the tar.gz files?  I
was unclear how to use them in a fashion that would allow me to use
Rswitch to switch versions.

Thanks for the time and resources it takes to provide the nightly builds!

Just follow the instructions listed below that downloads table:

"""Alternatively you can use the tar-ball (*.tar.gz) which must be  
unpacked in the root (e.g. tar fvxz R*.tar.gz -C /)"""

So. assuming you d/l this:

http://r.research.att.com/R-devel-leopard-universal.tar.gz

Open up your terminal and cd into your ~/Downloads folder (assuming  
that's where it was d/l'd). Then call this:

tar fvxz R-devel-leopard-universal.tar.gz -C /

R will be installed in the correct place (ie: /Library/Frameworks/ 
R.framework/Versions/2.10). Unpacking like this at first switches the  
symlink to point to the 2.10 install (I'm pretty sure). You can then  
use RSwitch as normal to jump back and forth between 2.9 and 2.10.

Hope that helps,

-steve

Message-ID: <E697ECE7-7075-4129-BB53-BEC1A78091FF@jhsph.edu>

Hi,

I was hoping to be to able to compile R-2.9.1 from the source as I've  
always done.

'./configure' always worked nice, but now it fails to find 'iconv',  
which is installed:

bcarvalh$ which iconv
/usr/bin/iconv

bcarvalh$ iconv --version
iconv (GNU libiconv 1.11)

Here's what I get with ./configure

checking iconv.h usability... yes
checking iconv.h presence... yes
checking for iconv.h... yes
checking for iconv... no
checking for iconvlist... no
configure: error: --with-iconv=yes (default) and a suitable iconv is  
not available


I'm running Mac OS X 10.5.8... any ideas on what I may be missing? Or  
suggestions on what to report in order to try to find the source of  
the problem?

Thank you very much,

benilton

Why not try to compile R-patched, aka 2.9.2 RC?

It works for me on Mac OS X, but then 2.9.1 did too?

But is libiconv?  It is the C function that it is not finding, not the 
executable.  (It might be part of Xcode: both my Macs have Xcode 3.1.2 
on, so I can't tell.)  E.g.

tystie% otool -L ~/R/R-patched/lib/i386/libR.dylib | grep iconv
 	/usr/lib/libiconv.2.dylib (compatibility version 7.0.0, current version 7.0.0)

Chances are that you may have some broken 3rd party iconv - do you  
have any custom stuff in /usr/local, /sw or similar hiding places? The  
right thing to report is config.log since that contains the reason why  
the iconv tests failed ...

Cheers,
Simon

I just tried R-patched and the same problem happens.

libiconv is available too:

bcarvalh$ ls -l /usr/lib/libiconv*
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel       16 Feb 21  2008 /usr/lib/libiconv. 
2.4.0.dylib -> libiconv.2.dylib
-rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  4147008 Nov 24  2007 /usr/lib/libiconv. 
2.dylib
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel       20 Feb 21  2008 /usr/lib/ 
libiconv.dylib -> libiconv.2.4.0.dylib
-rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel      795 Feb 19  2008 /usr/lib/libiconv.la

On R-2.8.1, which I compiled from the source a while back, here's what  
I get:

bcarvalh$ otool -L ~/bin/R-2.8.1/lib/libR.dylib | grep iconv
	/usr/lib/libiconv.2.dylib (compatibility version 7.0.0, current  
version 7.0.0)

And I also have Xcode 3.1.2.

Thank you very much for your attention and time,

That's OK then. You must be picking up another libiconv from
somewhere.

Hi,

I didn't expect to have anything outside standard locations... but  
looking at config.log, I noticed it was looking for libiconv in /usr/ 
local/lib (strange... but I do have libiconv* files there - I can't  
explain how).

Setting CPPFLAGS and LIBS correctly fixed the problem.

Thank you very much,

b

	files
Message-ID: <707844D0-016E-4AC4-9EB8-D9FF030CF7D9@comcast.net>


Is there an option to specify or change the default pdf viewer that  
would prevent un-breakable hangs after choosing a link in a menu of  
help files that happens to be a PDF file?

Example: upon highlighting the mboost package line in Package Manager  
and then selecting "package" in the lower window, the GUI hangs and R  
needs to be <Force-quit.>

 > sessionInfo()

attached base packages:

Prior to posting I downloaded the most recent 64bit GUI and still get  
a hang, albeit now with several pages of error messages. I can only  
see the last page of errors which all say (a Grab copy):

And if the mail server scrubs both those jpg and tiff files, I can  
provide a transcript if it would help, or the copied Problem report,  
or a log file (if you tell me where to find it).

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] package compilation problems
Message-ID: <4A8E444E.4080609@gmail.com>

Hi:

I've created a small package containing some C code. It checks and
installs on Linux, but on Mac I get the following error:

I have:
Mac OS 10.5
R version 2.9.1 i386-apple-darwin8.11.1 (from binary image)
Xcode 3.1.3 Developer Tools

It's the first time I'm trying to build/install a package from source on
 Mac.

(On the other hand R CMD SHLIB compiles the C code and calling it from R
also works on the Mac.)

Any help would be appreciated,
Szilard

Something has put /usr/local/lib/libiconv.2.dylib on your system, and 
it is not universal.  You should not need it: there is a system copy 
in /usr/lib.

You are going to need to investigate this for yourself -- it is not an 
R issue and I've no idea what might have put libiconv there.

Also note the R CMD INSTALL option

       --no-multiarch	build only the main architecture

which would have worked around this.

Thanks a lot, both suggestions helped!

(--no-multiarch helped immediately with installation, while cleaning up
/usr/local/lib/libiconv* fixed all the remaining problems).

Thanks a lot,

Hi,

I just wanted to post a follow up on this issue. It seems that someone  
notified Steve Weston of my problems shortly after I sent this email  
to the list and he was kind enough to exchange a few words with me off  
list (thanks to both of you!).

It looks as if this problem w/ the doMC backend was coming from my  
having been sourcing the "/Applications/R.app/Contents/Resources/GUI- 
tools.R" file in my ~/.Rprofile in order to get some functionality  
like quartz.save(..) when running from terminal (I don't really use  
R.app all that often).

I just wanted to let folks (and google) know that this problem hasn't  
popped up for me since I've stopped sourcing that file. I actually got  
the idea to source that file off some message in this list a while  
ago, so perhaps putting this message out there will help anyone who  
might find themselves in a similar situation I landed in.

Thanks for the help,

-steve

The Tcl/Tk toolkit runs under X11 so this is really a function of your  
X11. Once you select the text you can use the shortcuts defined for  
X11 so in a stock Apple X11 on both 10.4.1 and 10.5.8 <Cmd><C> works  
just fine. You failed to show any relevant code so I can only guess  
what you mean so I use this:

library(tcltk)
tt<-tktoplevel()
t<-tktext(tt)
tkpack(t)

Cheers,
Simon

Hi Simon,

thanks, I finally got it.
I was doing the exact same thing like you did, but it just didn't work.
Your e-mail brought me to the idea to update my X11. I was still  
working under version 2.1.6 and copy&paste in a tktext-window didn't  
work with this version. Updating to the latest release (X11 2.4.0) and  
selecting the checkbox "activate clipboard" under settings was the  
right way to make it work!

Thanks so much, Anne

Message-ID: <C98BEFB5-1882-4B4B-B8A9-37F557AF7339@googlemail.com>

hi,

I try to execute a R-script with terminal.

I use the following line;
R --vanilla --slave < "/path/script.R"

Everything works fine, except that the write.table() command within  
the script is not executed.

When I execute the script via the app the script saves some numbers to  
a file.
When I execute the script via terminal nothing is saved.



can someone help me on this?

ok, I am sorry.

The file was created and saved
but not at the place I thought it would be.

All is working now.


Sorry for bothering.

All,

Above is the link to a web site that is being updated with information  
on potential application compatibility issues with Snow Leopard (SL).  
Curiously, R is listed there...with an "Unknown Status".

Our copy of SL should arrive tomorrow.

Before updating, you should review this list to see if there are any  
potential issues with programs that you are using and SL.

If there are, you may have to wait to upgrade the OS until an  
application is updated to be compatible. I have to wait until PGP (my  
whole disk encryption program) is updated, which supposedly will be  
soon according to their tech support folks.

Regards,

Marc Schwartz

There are list members with access to the developer pre-release 
'seeds', and I have seen 'Mac OS X 10.6' in one report (with a 
corresponding sessionInfo() output). So it seems very likely there is 
no problem with R, and most likely none with with R.app.

(We are deferring upgrading until our sysadmins are back from holiday 
absences.)

Someone apparently didn't even try - of course R is fully compatible  
with SL (and this was mentioned even here on the list). As for source  
compilation the only possible issue is that X11 headers/libs may have  
to be specified at configure time.

Apple was kind to provide us with a seed so we can take advantage of  
the new technologies in SL.

Cheers,
Simon

It's been a while since this thread, but I could finally lay hands on  
a Nehalem to test, so I thought I'll share some tidbits.

My worries turned out to be true and Nehalems are not as fast with R  
as the synthetic benchmarks would make you think. The results are a  
mixed bag, but in overall R benchmarks a 2.26GHz 8-core Nehalem is  
somewhat slower (MASS 16.89s, R bench 20.4s) than a 2.66GHz quad-core  
Harpertown (MASS 18.8s, R bench 16.8s) and considerably slower than  
2.8GHZ 8-core Harpertown (MASS 16.04s, R bench 15.2s). This is mainly  
due to the fast that most tasks cannon use the excessive cores and  
individual cores are running at lower frequencies.

Some partial results are startling - for example "2800x2800 cross- 
product matrix (b = a' * a)" test literally kills Nehalems (0.64s for  
2.8GHz and 1.02s for 2.66GHz Harpertown and 4.67s(!!) for the  
Nehalem). There are outliers in the other direction as well, but not  
as surprising: "FFT over 2,400,000 random values" is 0.64s for Nehalem  
and 0.93s/1.8s for Harpertowns.

The tests used are from http://r.research.att.com/benchmarks
(R 2.9.2 release was used but admittedly the OS version varied)
Clearly, benchmarks never tell the full story and there may be uses  
that take advantage of the one or another architecture, but the bottom  
line is that Nehalems are not universally faster, so don't throuw your  
Harpertowns out just yet ;).

I expect a 2.66GHz Nehalem to test soon and will post the update.

If you have any experiences to share, please feel free to chip in.

Cheers,
Simon

PS: I have also looked at 32-bit vs 64-bit and it's an equally mixed  
bag - some tasks are considerably slower in 64-bit others considerably  
faster, so no clear answer there, either.

Yes, you're right, but they are roughly comparable (Nehalem 12GB,  
Harpertown 2.8GHZ 10GB, Harpertown 2.66GHz 16GB). The test should not  
be reaching their limits - I was also running the 2.66 Harpertown with  
only 1GB of RAM with no big differences ...

I have been using SL for over a year. Compiling and running a x86-84  
bit R
can be done without problems. There are about 600 packages in my R  
install,
all build and run without problems. I don't know about R.app, though.  
I do
find that R on SL, with suitable optimization flags, feels quite a bit  
faster.

Would you mind sharing what optimization flags those might be? :-)

In one of your previous posts you mention that you configure R for  
source compilation via this command:

configure --with-aqua --with-blas='\''-framework vecLib'\'' --with- 
lapack --prefix=/usr/local/R --disable-R-framework --with-readline -- 
with-cairo --enable-memory-profiling --enable-R-shlib --x-includes=/ 
usr/X11R6/include --x-libraries=/usr/X11R6/lib --build=x86_64-apple- 
darwin10 --host=x86_64-apple-darwin10 --target=x86_64-apple-darwin10

I'm not sure I see any optimization flags there (aside from specifying  
darwin10 (for snow leopard, I reckon?)), but is all that you mean?

Thanks,
-steve

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] multiple R versions in a multi-user environment
Message-ID: <4EB45676-3FA3-4A40-A40D-F4A95F4D263C@metrumrg.com>

We run R in a multiuser environment (Mac OSx Leopard Server utilizing R 
+ESS over an ssh connection) that requires us to keep multiple  
versions of R (R-2.7.2 and higher) available on the same machine.   I  
have successfully installed multiple R versions using the binaries for  
Mac OSX  and deleting the relevant Receipt before installing the newer  
version of R.  My problem occurs when allowing individuals to run  
different versions of R. I would like to be able to allow users to run  
any verison that is currently installed.  The Rswitch gui works nicely  
if I want to make a global switch (for all individuals) from one  
version of R to another.  The Mac OSx FAQ recommends not to hardcode  
the shell scripts to start R to a specific version (FAQ 12.15). Am I  
better off building R from source for each version we need and  
bypassing the Frameworks approach for R used by the binaries or is the  
a "safe" approach to use the binaries and utilize hardcoded shell  
scripts to point to a given version of R?  (I have created some shell  
scripts (hacked from those provided) that allows me to start either  
R-2.6.1 or R-2.7.2 but the Mac OSX R FAQ recommends against this  
approach.) If there is somewhere else I should be reading, I would  
appreciate a pointer and I would be happy to review.

Thanks for any help.

Bill

Since you do not use R.app I think you would be better off not to use  
the Framework with the Current
soft link, install different R's in /usr/local or similar, use  
appropriate prefixes in configure, and (minimally)
hack the  startup scripts. Updating packages from source, or R's from  
svn, will not be a problem then.
Since it's the same machine throughout, you don't need universal  
builds either.

The FAQ clearly describes the issues so you're free to use it if those  
don't apply to your setup or they are not critical to you. The whole  
point of the FAQ entry is so you can make an informed decision about  
whether it's ok for you to use it that way or not.

Cheers,

I've been doing consistent time benchmarks across a range of computers
(no Nehalems yet). A few of these are OS X related and might be of
interest.

The test systems:

A. MacPro: Dual Quad core 2.8 GHz, 32 GB RAM. Running either OS X
10.5.6, 10.6 or Slackware 12.2
B. MacBook Pro:  Intel Core 2 Duo 2.4 GHz, 4 GB RAM OS X 10.5.6

All using R 2.9.0 with at least 3 replicates per benchmark.

The benchmarks were:

1. RMA: RMA normalize 57 hgu133plus2 microarrays. The time quoted is
just to normalize (not to read the files in).

The summary in minutes:

                                    group mean   sd
              MacBook Pro 2.4 GHz Leopard 1.02 0.01
 MacBook Pro 2.4 GHz Leopard Snow Leopard 1.09 0.35
                     MacPro 2.8 GHz Linux 1.26 0.06
                   MacPro 2.8 GHz Leopard 0.89 0.13

There was one outlier with Snow Leopard. Without it:

                                    group mean   sd
              MacBook Pro 2.4 GHz Leopard 1.02 0.01
 MacBook Pro 2.4 GHz Leopard Snow Leopard 0.95 0.01
                     MacPro 2.8 GHz Linux 1.26 0.06
                   MacPro 2.8 GHz Leopard 0.89 0.13

2 .Kernels: fit a support vector machine and a relevance vector
machine to 1,500 samples with 1,000 variables. Times for each model
are separated out.

For ksvm:

                                    group mean   sd
              MacBook Pro 2.4 GHz Leopard 0.22 0.01
 MacBook Pro 2.4 GHz Leopard Snow Leopard 0.19 0.01
                     MacPro 2.8 GHz Linux 0.27 0.01
                   MacPro 2.8 GHz Leopard 0.26 0.05


For rvm:

                                    group mean   sd
              MacBook Pro 2.4 GHz Leopard 0.71 0.01
 MacBook Pro 2.4 GHz Leopard Snow Leopard 0.60 0.01
                     MacPro 2.8 GHz Linux 2.24 0.53
                   MacPro 2.8 GHz Leopard 0.46 0.05

I have no idea what happened with the Linux runs.

3. RandomForest: fit a randomForest model with 1,500 samples with
1,000 variables with the 5,000 trees and mtry = 100. The timings also
include the variable importance calculations.

The rows with >1 node was using a parallel randomforest via the nws package:

                                    group  mean   sd
              MacBook Pro 2.4 GHz Leopard 22.31 0.15
    MacBook Pro 2.4 GHz Leopard (2 nodes) 12.72 0.27
    MacBook Pro 2.4 GHz Leopard (5 nodes) 13.51   NA
 MacBook Pro 2.4 GHz Leopard Snow Leopard 21.47 0.81
                     MacPro 2.8 GHz Linux 17.28 0.05
           MacPro 2.8 GHz Linux (5 nodes)  4.61 0.26
                   MacPro 2.8 GHz Leopard 17.42 0.07
         MacPro 2.8 GHz Leopard (5 nodes)  3.87 0.03

So, basically, Snow Leopard does slightly better but not much (I think
this was expected). I'll be testing more on the Mac Pros soon. The
code is pretty basic, but I'll be happy to send it to anyone who wants
a head-on comparison.

I'm wondering what is the best way is to take advantage of the  
multiple CPUs on a MacPro?  For example, does someone have suggestions  
on how to setup and use parApply functions, in the snow package, on a  
multi-core Mac?

Thanks,

I don't know if it's the best, but lately I like using the foreach  
package with the multicore backend

  * http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/foreach/index.html
  * http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/doMC/index.html
  * http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/multicore/

You might want to take a look at Dirk's course notes:

   dirk.eddelbuettel.com/papers/bocDec2008introHPCwithR.pdf

to understand what R can do in general. I use nws and Rpmi (via the
snow package). I haven't tried the multicore package yet.

You have the required libraries for mpi, so you might want to start
there. The snow package is pretty easy to used, as is foreach.
