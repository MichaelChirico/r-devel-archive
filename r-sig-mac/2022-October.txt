Hi,
what version is best compatible with MacOS 10.12.6?
I cannot get r program on my computer.
Thank You, Julie

Julie,

the R binaries compatible with macOS 10.12 can be seen here:

https://mac.r-project.org/bin/macosx/el-capitan/base/

since those work on Mac OS X 10.11 and higher.

If you need a more recent version of R you would have to compile R and all packages from sources. However, given the dangers of using such an old version as macOS 10.12 I would strongly recommend updating the macOS version instead.

Cheers,
Simon

Dear R-SIG-MAC list members,

I'm attempting to use the function as.bigq() in R's gmp package, but it
always causes an "illegal operation". For example, it triggers the
following output:

*** caught illegal operation ***
address 0x11ffc8b21, cause 'illegal opcode'

Traceback:
 1: as.bigq(1)

Possible actions:
1: abort (with core dump, if enabled)
2: normal R exit
3: exit R without saving workspace
4: exit R saving workspace

I cannot reproduce this on a Windows machine. I'm working on a MacBook Pro
with model identifier MacBookPro18,1.

Thank you,
Noah

Noah,

this looks like you may be using R for older Intel machines on a M1 Mac Book (via emulation). Please double-check that you installed the R version appropriate to your machine - your sessionInfo() shoud show:

Platform: aarch64-apple-darwin20 (64-bit)

If not, install the correct R version.

Cheers,
Simon

Message-ID: <42eba9c5-a681-e34f-38ec-23c42c780f18@stats.ox.ac.uk>

The problem being that devQuartz.c uses a deprecated and now removed 
interface (ATS).

Building with --without-aqua will work.

I am sure that Simon will fix this, but not in time for 4.2.2 which is 
in code freeze.

Note this only affects building: as the CRAN binary distributions are 
built on much older versions of macOS they should continue to build. 
This is purely a heads up for those building from source that they may 
want to delay upgrading to Ventura (but someone needed to to find the 
issue).

For the first time for quite a while, upgrading to Ventura removes the 
Command Line Tools which need reinstalling.

Thanks for the heads-up, Brian.

Older binaries still install and run on Ventura, I hope?

I intend to hold off updating at least the office machine (which builds the tarballs) until 4.3.0, for platform stability. The push for Ventura doesn't seem to have arrived here yet, but probably will come in a few days.

By the way, I have been getting update requests for "Command Line Tools beta n for Xcode 14.1", even though I have no recollection of signing up for beta versions. I'm rather reluctant to install those.

They do, in so far as I have tested (which included some plotting).

That's an Apple trait. As you are on macOS 12.x, I would feel free to 
ignore them: even those for the released CLT 14 (although (I was using 
that on 12.6 for a month with no issues).

Somehow you sent HTML only, and that renders oddly in Thunderbird.

Have you considered GhostScript?  That used to be my viewer of choice 
for Postscript long ago.  I think TeXShop may be a wrapper.

My box has Photoshop as the default viewer for .eps and TeXShop for .ps. 
  I almost never use Photoshop: it comes as part of Adobe's 
Photographers Bundle.

Having found the relevant release note:

https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos-release-notes/macos-13-release-notes

I can add a bit more info.

1) The build failure is only seen if you are using the macOS 13 SDK.  It 
has been possible to build with the 12.3 SDK.  But if you don't yet have 
the macOS 13 SDK you are likely to get upgraded to it soon.  Look at

ls -l `xcrun -show-sdk-path`

to see what you have (it is a symlink, to MacOSX13.0.sdk on my system).

2) If you are, a workaround is to add something like

-mmacosx-version-min=12.0

to CFLAGS.

Hi Prof. Ripley,

Thanks for your reply. Responses inline below.

My apologies on that.?

That is curious and I now see that in looking at the raw message content. I am not sure how that occurred, as I had set the e-mail to plain text when composing, so somehow that changed at some point. What is even more confusing, is that by default, had the e-mail been initially composed as HTML/RTF, it would normally be sent as multipart MIME, which does not appear to have been the case here, leaving me even more confused.

I am sending this now as plain text, so hopefully that is what is sent. I will keep track and if that is not the case, report a bug.

> Have you considered GhostScript? That used to be my viewer of choice

Yes, TeXShop is a GUI front-end previewer as you note below, included in the macTeX distribution, using underlying functionality. Ghostscript 9.55 is also installed as part of macTeX, which I have installed as I still heavily use Sweave to generate PDF reports for clients, some of which use ps-tricks to generate flow chart figures. Thus, the included figure content is generated as PDF and PS/EPS files, which I sometimes quickly preview, until now, using macOS Preview.

There is some coverage now of this change in Preview in various Mac fora, with some hypothesizing that this change in Preview may be security related, pointing to a change by Microsoft in Office back in 2017/2018:

??https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/support-for-eps-images-has-been-turned-off-in-office-a069d664-4bcf-415e-a1b5-cbb0c334a840

Of course, nothing official from Apple that I have seen.

> My box has Photoshop as the default viewer for .eps and TeXShop for .ps.

> Photographers Bundle.

I also have the full Adobe Acrobat application installed, as I have other functionality provided by that app that I need, so pay for that as a business expense.

It is interesting that now that I am trying to open some PS/EPS files with apps other than Preview, if I use TeXShop, the file opens right away, whereas if I use Acrobat, I get a security pop-up asking me if I trust the source that generated the file, which in this case, is me. Perhaps Apple could take a similar approach with Preview, if security was the motivation for this change, and they elect to revert it.

This was more of a heads up for folks, who like me, have been dependent upon using Preview for a quick look at these files, which are commonly generated using R.

Thanks and regards,

Marc

Perhaps Apple could take a similar approach with Preview, if security was the motivation for this change, and they elect to revert it.

 [External] macOS Ventura (13) Preview App Drops Support
 for PS/EPS File Rendering

Hi Rich,

macOS includes pstopdf (/usr/bin/pstopdf) as a local, albeit dated, distiller.?

ps2pdf (/usr/local/bin/ps2pdf) is installed with the macTeX distribution with Ghostscript, and I use that as a last step in a shell script to process the .tex files via latex and dvips, when using Sweave, since the use of PS based components like pstricks precludes directly going to pdf with pdflatex.

The advantage of Preview was that it was a quick way to view a PS/EPS file, since you could just click on the file in Finder and hit the space bar to do a quick visual file view, or also fully open the file and render it as well, if preferred. I would use the former frequently, especially if I had several PS/EPS files in a folder and quickly wanted to confirm which one had the content that I was looking for. That applied whether the PS/EPS file was generated via Sweave or directly using postscript() in an R session.

As noted below, there are multiple alternative options, some "free", some not, and it may come down to specific workflow issues as to which approach may be better suited for useRs that need this capability.

Thanks!

Marc
