Randy,

the good news is I know why (Apple changed a bit the structure of such opening AppleScript event descriptor in Lion), the bad news is I have to go through the scarce documentation. Hope that I find a solution today.

Best,

As a Greek would say "heureka" 

I've just committed the fix :) [R.app revision 6127]

Now it works from MacOSX 10.5 to 10.8.

Message-ID: <010DFB4F-B17A-4D5F-B624-0E5098AEEA4A@remoteinformation.com.au>

G'day all,

this is hopefully straightforward, but I'm not sure where to look.

I am trying to build the surveillance package (which is excluded from the binaries because of a memory problem). I have successfully built it previously on Snow Leopard, but I have recently upgraded to Lion (7.3). I have installed the developer tools and the gfortran from r.research.att.com

When I use the GUI it gets this far :

* installing *source* package ?surveillance? ...
** package ?surveillance? successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked
** Creating default NAMESPACE file
** libs
*** arch - i386
sh: make: command not found
ERROR: compilation failed for package ?surveillance?

thinking that this might be an architecture issue (I'm in R64 and it's trying to build -386) I try from the command line using --no-multiarch, but it fails saying no such file or directory (output below). Knowing just enough to be dangerous, I think that it means the lines in the src file stcd-assuncaocorea.h :

#include <list>
#include <valarray>

are trying to include some sort of resource (library?), but not looking in the right place. This being the case, I'm not sure how to direct it to the right place, nor where that place is. 

If I'm correct, can someone please help me with this?

cheers

Ben

Because it says that make is not found it would suggest that you need  
to provide more details about which version and where the developer  
tools were installed. I'm wondering if the PATH for R may not include  
the proper location.

This package also require package:spc. The one that was used when I  
just compiled from source on a Leopard machine was spc_0.4.1.

Further to this, I am starting to think I missed some thing else : attempting to compile rgeos gives me :

NB: this is a different message to if I do it in the GUI :

So I don't understand why different problems for each, and why problems at all. If any can suggest anything, I'd be very grateful.

FWIW - I installed the new Xcode, but still have the old one - is that likely to cause problems?

cheers

Ben

You don't have Xcode command line tools installed. Note that Xcode 4.3 and later no longer work since they do not install tools in the system anymore. You can modify your PATH to include the tools that are now inside Xcode.app, but probably easier is to install the command line tools (either from Xcode's Preferences or from ADC).

Cheers,
Simon

My lack of low-level understanding may well be at fault here by the path for r do you mean this result from the Sys.getenv() call

in the GUI:      PATH    "/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin" 
in which case - none of them have a make in the them. There are however 'make' commands in :
/Developer/usr/bin (the old Xcode)
and
/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr (I'm guessing the new one for Lion)


In the terminal 

PATH 
"/Library/Frameworks/PROJ.framework/Programs:/Library/Frameworks/GDAL.framework/Programs:/Library/Frameworks/MapServer.framework/Programs:/usr/local/pgsql/bin:/usr/local/mysql/bin:/usr/local/zend/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/X11/bin:/Developer/usr/bin:." 

Which I guess explains the different error messages: So I added the new Xcode location to the system path, and re-ran R in the terminal and tried again :

still no joy - still can't find stdlib.h etc. Is there something else I've missed?


cheers

Ben

You can modify your PATH to include the tools that are now inside Xcode.app, but probably easier is to install the command line tools (either from Xcode's Preferences or from ADC).

That nailed it - I installed the command line tools, (the delay was the ADC network being down) and both rgeos and surveillance built successfully!

Message-ID: <CAF42j22EW7dbaCDG33QP=68768aq=O2iVDsYv8kVtrG3QxYBSA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

Are there plans to modify install.packages() on Mac so that if
type="source", the package is installed for all installed
sub-architectures?

This works for Windows.

Currently,
install.packages("mypkg", type="source")
**may** do the right thing, depending on what type of native code the
package has, whether if has a configure script., etc, but there's no
guarantee.

I might add that even installing a binary is not guaranteed to give
you .so files for all sub-architectures. CRAN and Bioconductor create
multi-arch binaries, but other package distributors may not do this,
in fact, they likely won't, since the procedure for generating such
binaries is not part of R and is therefore not documented as such.

There are of course ways to work around this. But it would be nice not
to have to work around it, and it would be very nice if a single
command could install a package (and, importantly, all its
dependencies) from source for all available architectures.

Thanks!
Dan

The same is true for Windows - to my best knowledge the rules are the same on all platforms -- Makefile or configure prevent a package from being built for more than one architecture, because they may modify the sources in-place and thus the package can only be built once. The only difference I'm aware of is that some Windows packages use configure.win for things other than configuration, so binary maintainers may choose to ignore those but that is not the default AFAIK.

The only difference I'm aware of is that some Windows packages use configure.win for things other than configuration, so binary maintainers may choose to ignore those but that is not the default AFAIK.

But OTOH, section 5.4 of the "R for Mac OS X FAQ" says:

   Once all tools are in place it is considerably easy to build an
   universal binary. If the package does not contain a configure script
   then a regular package installation using either install.packages or
   R CMD INSTALL automatically creates an universal binary. If the
   package contains a configure script then it cannot be compiled
   in-place for multiple platforms, and the following process should be
   used. Assuming that you have a source package called foo_1.0.tar.gz
   that uses a configure script, it can be installed universally using
   the following three-step process:

      # full 32-bitIntel install
      R --arch=i386 CMD INSTALL foo_1.0.tar.gz
      # 64-bit Intel library
      R --arch=x86_64 CMD INSTALL --libs-only foo_1.0.tar.gz
      # 32-bit PowerPC library (will require Rosetta to build)
      R --arch=ppc CMD INSTALL --libs-only foo_1.0.tar.gz

So the question is: why can't R CMD INSTALL just do this? I can deal
with the 3 above steps for a single package (assuming I have access
to the shell). But in general I like to be able to install packages
from R because typically the package I install requires a lot of
dependencies and install.packages() will solve the dependency problem
for me. Unfortunately, using the above trick in that context is a
pain.

Couldn't R CMD INSTALL --merge-multiarch be supported on Mac and do
something like the 3 steps above? That would be a first step towards
a little bit more convenience as I would be able to do

   install.packages("foo", INSTALL_opts="--merge-multiarch")

Thanks,
H.

I meant:

   install.packages("foo", type="source",
                    INSTALL_opts="--merge-multiarch")

and assuming source package foo is available on the repositories
install.packages() is pointing at.

Thanks,
H.

That's my understanding too -- a small list of such packages is already 
known to INSTALL.

Eh?  The recommended approach, INSTALL --merge-multiarch, _is_ part of 
R.  Although I rarely use it on Macs, AFAIK it works equally well there 
as on Windows.  And install.packages() takes arguments to be passed to 
INSTALL via INSTALL_opts .

We are not so far off that, but can only workaround _some_ of the 
strange things package maintainers do.  For example, all but 0.5% of 
CRAN packages which install at all install 'out of the box' on Windows: 
the exceptions need --multi-arch.  On a Mac the figure appears to be 1-2%.

My experience is that there is a _tiny_ small proportion of R users 
installing from source on systems with multiple architectures who care 
about more than one architecture.  (It is a long while since I used 
32-bit R on Windows, Mac or Linux except as an R developer to test 
things.) And I think most of those people are knowledgeable enough to 
write their own scripts to cover the exceptions.

I never knew that --merge-multiarch was available for Macs. I tested
it and it seems to work.
I assumed that it was not available for Macs because it appears in the
"Windows only" section of R CMD INSTALL --help on my R (R version
2.15.0 alpha (2012-03-02 r58567).

Perhaps --merge-multiarch can be moved out of the "Windows" only
section of R CMD INSTALL --help?

Thanks,
Dan

Sorry, it appears that --merge-multiarch never got released except for 
Windows.  We can certainly finish that off.

Your version of R is out-of-date. Binaries are only reliably synced to  
the current major version (and you are asked not to post problems  
until you _have_ upgraded.)

Following on what David said,

Are you equipped to build the package locally? That is, do you have
gcc and g++ installed?

I'm almost certain that a local build (or an upgrade to 2.14 or 2.15
in just over two weeks time) will be the easiest way to fix things.

I'm not sure why you say that. He seems to have a fairly standard / 
R.framework/ location for his /Resources/ and the fact that he still  
posting in HTML suggests he is not likely to have compiled his R from  
source.  A few years ago I would often solve problems by building from  
source, but in recent years when there is a binary package available,  
it generally installs without problems.

(I do see that there is a ../bin/../2.13/  node in the CRAN mirror at  
ku, which is not typical, so perhaps we are both wrong here. Now that  
I check, both the Berkeley and the CMU CRAN mirrors seem to keep their  
Mac binaries a lot longer than is required, so KU is just following US- 
local tradition. The CMU mirror has binaries back to R 2.8.)

Is your experience different?

Oh -- perhaps I was ambiguous and I apologize for any confusion that
caused: I meant to just build the package himself from source so that
it would match his architecture, hence why gfortran wouldn't be needed
as it would to build R.

Incidentally, doesn't CRAN usually support one minor version back? It
seems that it checks for "R-oldrel" (which appears to currently be
2.13.2) -- I don't know if the patch releases are ever incompatible,
though I doubt so since things seem to divide into R x.y folders,
rather than R x.y.z in the CRAN servers.

Yes, that's pretty much the policy.  But with 2.15.0 alpha, 2.14.x is 
now 'one minor release back', and building for 2.13.x has been switched 
off (it seems to have been for Macs on Feb 10, a little earlier than I 
would have expected -- the Windows last updates were on Feb 28).

Inquiring minds would like to ask, why did you change computer then?

R.app has a command editor, and the function source() sources R scripts (i.e. stuff like your file.R).

A good dose of RTFM will help, too.

On the Mac side we never build more than two releases so whenever we start building R-devel packages on daily basis is the time that we stop building R-oldrel. In fact it is very common that after a release packages are coming in requiring the new release so it becomes increasingly pointless to run oldrel builds -- so historically they have been switched off even much earlier. This may be the case even more so in the future because of the new R release schedule and the fact that we may move up OS X target version which will make building old releases even harder.

Mamush,

I might also suggest that you might like to try RStudio, which is an integrated development environment. Furthermore, you might want to look around at TexShop, which can be easily integrated with Sweave/Tangle facilities. And also TextWrangler, which is free text editor (for working on your .r files) also has script integration which allows you to cntl+enter to send text to the R cmd interpreter and display the results.

There are a couple of papers you should look for using Google (it took a while, but I located it on my Mac, too): Learning to Sweave in APA style was very helpful, as was Choosing Your Workflow Applications by Keiran Healey.

Well, the integrated editor in the R.app allows exactly that (the others are usually trying to copy it) and supports R code, Rd files etc. It is the canonical way to work with R,  so it is beyond me why people would suggest millions of different external apps while R has all you need. I can understand if people used to those apps prefer them to R (e.g I sometimes use emacs instead because I'm used to it), but for a new user I would not require them to learn so many new tools.

Cheers,
Simon

Check if you have X11.app in /Applications/Utilities

Also, when you get that sorted out, I think I needed to follow the
instructions here:
http://danbri.org/words/2011/12/08/761

in order to install rgl from source, namely you'd do:

R CMD INSTALL rgl_0.92.798.tar.gz ?configure-args=??disable-carbon? rgl

But, if you're not running R-devel, why not just install the prebuilt
package using `install.packages`?

(pretty sure that you'd still need to ensure X11 is installed, though)

Simon,

Well, it looks like the R.app editor has made tremendous strides since I last looked at it (e.g., nice indenting that conforms to the ESS C++ style, etc.).
Can I infer from  your email that there is some .Rnw support as well?

If so, aside from platform independence, it looks like there's less and less of a reason to stick to emacs-ess.

Can you point us to the Sweave/Tangle documentation for the R.app editor?

Thanks,

dave

Furthermore, you might want to look around at TexShop, which can be easily integrated with Sweave/Tangle facilities.

I can understand if people used to those apps prefer them to R (e.g I sometimes use emacs instead because I'm used to it), but for a new user I would not require them to learn so many new tools.

I'm not well versed in how to check if X11 is properly installed, but
the fact that you don't see it under /Applications/Utilities/X11.app
seems weird to me.

I'm also not sure if it's installed by default just by installing
XCode (I reckon Simon will chime in soon).

I don't think you mentioned what version of OS X you are running, did you?

Anyway, I'm not sure what's gong on, but if I were you I think I'd try
to (re?)install X11 and try again.

I know that you can install X11 from your system install disks -- at
one point in time, you would find this under some "Optional Installs"
something on the system install disk, not sure where it is now.

Alternatively, I think you could also install X11 using the installer
here, if you like:

Hi,
Teaching with R, I find the mac GUI very nice, and so do students once they see the shortcuts etc. (I don?t get why mac people would use R-Studio?)

For myself, I still use a customized Textmate command bundle to work with R.

One thing I miss in R.app at present is themes, especially this one

https://github.com/avian/TextMate-Tomorrow-Theme

It would be great if R Gui could look like this

Instead of this

Hi Tim,

first, of course obviously ;) , you can set the Editor's colours in the Preferences in such a way that it looks like the TM theme.

But, be a bit patient, I'm working on a refactoring of the colour settings in R.app which - amongst others - will allow to export/import themes including the chance to import a TM theme directly ;)

Best,

To narrowly address the "why would Mac people use R-Studio", as a user of Emacs/ESS for >10 years, the advantage is going to be primarily cross-platform support AFAICS. As one who has "evolved" from using R on Windows starting in late 2001, to RH/Fedora Linux in late 2002, to OSX in early 2009, the one constant has been Emacs/ESS.

If one is in a mixed OS environment, I can see much logic in using R-Studio, if one is not open to Emacs/ESS. It can provide a consistent and productive working environment. You don't have to deal with training on multiple "IDEs", recalling instinctively multiple methods of interacting with editors and other functionality, which increases productivity.

I have played with R-Studio and R.app. Both are good and much credit goes to the developers of both.

Also, as one who has been routinely using version control (svn) for a number of years, the support in Emacs/ESS has been extremely helpful. R-Studio appears to have support for both svn and git from what I can tell via the project functionality, though I have not played with it. I don't believe that such support is available in R.app, though I stand to be corrected on that. Of course for svn on OSX, there is always the CLI or GUI based apps such as Cornerstone.

Marc Schwartz

Hi,

I just noticed the following weird issue.  If I go to the menu 'Packages and Data', select 'Package Installer' the installer goes up, but when I tell it to give the list of binaries available (I like to keep up to date, and check every couple of days) the list comes up empty. The list for CRAN sources, and for Bioconductor binaries work fine.

I tried to change the mirror, but it does not make a difference.

Am I the only one with the problem? what's going on?

What is going on is that 
http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/leopard/contrib/2.14/ has an empty 
PACKAGES file.  Given that it hadn't been updated for a couple of weeks 
on Weds, you may just need to be patient.  But in any case, only Simon 
can fix this as only he has sufficient access to the package builder. 
So reporting to Simon is always going to be the most effective way 
forward for similar problems.

Perhaps this can encourage people to test 2.15.0 beta?  Its binary 
package repository does have a populated PACKAGES file.

Few days ago the build machine has lost network connectivity due to a faulty ethernet cable, so maybe it has thrown off mirroring, that's the closest I can get to an explanation...

Yes, we can't stress is often enough that we need people to test betas, reporting bugs after the release is too late!

I've manually updated the index files on CRAN, so when this propagates 
the packages should be seen again.  Also asked CRAN to take a look at 
their mirroring scripts.

Could PACKAGES file be in some damaged state that R cannot process?  
When I change the repository to that value  in the R64 GUI and try to  
see either either the binary versions or the source versions of  
contributed packages in the Package Installer I get these warnings at  
the console:

Warning: unable to access index for repository  http://r.research.att.com/bin/macosx/leopard/contrib/2.14

Warning: unable to access index for repository  http://r.research.att.com/src/contrib

I am able to see the .tgz packages at http://r.research.att.com/bin/macosx/leopard/contrib/2.14/ 
  with Firefox.

I am able to get a list of source packages (but not binary) to display  
in the Package Installer if I use a different repository. And I am  
able to install binary packages with ... for example:

install.packages("actuar", repo="http://r.research.att.com",  
type="mac.binary.leopard")

(Which updated an existing version to the current version.)

Admittedly I am running a somewhat behind the times version, but this  
is completely different behavior than it has exhibited up to a few  
days ago.

I don't know about that, but changing the repo (yesterday) fixed the isse on the R64 GUI (yesterday's latest GUI version). No warnings.

I updated binary packages  this morning (17 March 2012  approx. 9:00 CET) without any problem at all from http://cran.r-project.org. Yesterday no update appeared possible (Get List couldn't retrieve the list of packages ).
Using R 2.14.2.

That is really odd - in particular because the src/contrib one is really just an rsync from CRAN so it is not processed on my side at all. Could it be some proxy or internet setting that is different in Firefox and your R? Or some intermittent Internet problem?

Both directories are populated by rsync and it moves files atomically so there should never be an incomplete file ...

I checked on the master site and there are PACKAGES in all directories:

urbanek at ix:/R/cran/bin/macosx/leopard/contrib$ ls -l 2.1?/PACKAGES*
-rw-r--r-- 1 urbanek urbanek 305553 Jul  2  2010 2.10/PACKAGES

and the last two are updated by the nightly script (on the build machine, so, again, those are moved atomically). I'll double-check the builds, but everything seems just fine ...

Thanks,

Yes, I updated PACKAGES[.gz] on the CRAN master this morning.  There is 
clearly a problem mirroring to CRAN and I have alerted the relevant 
people.  Hopefully mirroring will not wipe out the files I copied over 
without putting later ones in their place.

In case anyone actually needs to use the Package Installer while this  
get investigated, I see that the CRAN repo at "the Hutch" still is in  
a state where it will populate the binaries list.

http://cran.fhcrc.org

Neither the AT&T, the CMU, nor the ETH CRAN repos will do so as of 1PM  
US Eastern time.

David,

thanks, the mystery is finally solved. The list of package was overflowing one of the scripts that collects all packages so it produced an empty PACKAGE file due to "argument list too long". That should be now fixed and http://R.research.att.com/ mirror should be up to date now. I still don't know why it worked occasionally (like last time when I was investigating it) but the bottom line that it should be ok now.

Thanks,
Simon

Hi Hans,

Any solution for this now?
This has been confusing me for a while. I need to open Rdata files very often.

I guess there might be an automatic text substitution problem, but there is no option in Leopard to fully deactivate it. Could it be something else?

We have no idea what it can be since you didn't give us an example (in
R code) of what you are trying to do and the exact error it gives.

Also, when you say R 2.14.12, I guess you mean R 2.14.2 (there is no x.x.12).

If you can somehow provide the file that is failing as well, it would
be easier to help -- one way to do so is put it up on a web server
somewhere that we can then
`source(http://yourserver.com/badfile.txt')` ... (I'm not sure if this
email list strips attachments, is all).

Please use http://r.research.att.com as mirror (or any mirrors that are more recent like the CRAN.r-project.org master ...).

I can replicate this with readLines if I stop
the blocking right after the D but not if
I take the whole line.
I don't get it though with either read.table or scan

[1] "A" "B" "C"

  V1
1  A
2  B

4  D

It looks like it is documented depending on the blocking 
behavior of your connection.

>From ?readLines

"If the final line is incomplete (no final EOL marker) the behaviour 
depends on whether the connection is blocking or not. 
For a non-blocking text-mode connection the incomplete
 line is pushed back, silently. For all other connections the 
line will be accepted, with a warning.


Whatever mode the connection is opened in, any of LF, CRLF 
or CR will be accepted as the EOL marker for a line."

Thanks for all the replies, and thanks Alan for finding the workaround!

For silent operation with.without the final EOL:
suppressWarnings(read.delim(pipe("pbpaste"), header=FALSE))

+ a bit of R-fu to convert 1D data.frame's into vector's when appropriate

cheers,
Mark

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] qtbase installation problems on MacOS
Message-ID: <FF28807F-3239-4704-89A1-DD24D8E5F40B@gmx.de>

Dear R GUI / MacOS experts,

I having some trouble installing qtbase on MacOS (10.6.8).
I installed a recent version of Qt and cmake.
Unfortunately I am a rookie when it comes to installation procedures.
Below I attached the (shortened) terminal output.
I erased some of the parts that reported no failures.
I am especially suspicious the about the line: "include directory "/usr/include;/Library/Frameworks/QtCore.framework" doesn't exist " 
But I do not know what to make of it.
Any ideas what the problem might be?

Thanks in advance!

--Mark

PS. I translated the last few lines as I did not succeed in changing the language settings to english

This line is incorrect. It should read

	set cmd to "${HOME}/bin/Sweave.sh " & "-ld "  & (the quoted form of POSIX path of mypath)

But don't call Sweave.sh directly. Doesn't seem to work properly in BBEdit.
(At least not for me)

Create a runSweave.sh script:

<script>
# run Sweave.sh in directory of input file

cd $(dirname "$1") 
${HOME}/bin/Sweave.sh -ld $(basename "$1")
</script>

This seems to be 
and replace the line mentioned above with

	set cmd to "${HOME}/bin/runSweave.sh " & (the quoted form of POSIX path of mypath)


Furthermore make sure that Sweave.sh and runSweave.sh are executable.

You should have a symbolic link in ${HOME}/Library/texmf/tex to 

/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/share/texmf/tex/latex

so that latex can find Sweave.sty.

This worked for me.

In the end it seems that you can just as well skip the Applescript thing and just make a runSweave shell script.
See the manual on Unix scripting.

Hi,

Sorry to bother you about what is probably a bad configuration of my system. I have the following error when checking a package on my Mac (Mac Pro mid-2010 with Mac OS X Lion 10.7.3 (11D50), running R-2.14.2 from CRAN). I have Xcode 4.3.2 and the GNU Fortran compiler from http://r.research.att.com/. The package is prepRISA and it compiles without problem on R-Forge.

Here is the install.out file of R CMD check prepRISA:

I tried to search about this SystemStubs library, but could only find that it is deprecated in MacOS X 10.7.

Here is my sessionInfo:

The problem seems local to your R or settings - did you perhaps override any PKG_* with bogus flags? This is what you get with released R:

** libs
*** arch - i386
gcc -arch i386 -std=gnu99 -I/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/include -I/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/include/i386  -I/usr/local/include    -fPIC  -Wall -pedantic -g -O2 -c repClass.c -o repClass.o
gcc -arch i386 -std=gnu99 -dynamiclib -Wl,-headerpad_max_install_names -undefined dynamic_lookup -single_module -multiply_defined suppress -L/usr/local/lib -o prepRISA.so repClass.o -F/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/.. -framework R -Wl,-framework -Wl,CoreFoundation
installing to /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.14/Resources/library/prepRISA/libs/i386

note that you have superfluous "-L/usr/local/mysql/lib -lmysqlclient -lSystemStubs" in your linking step which is *not* part of R ...

Cheers,
Simon

Thank you, this probably comes from a previous install of a mysql server implementation. Is there a way to know how these flags get added to the R CMD gcc command line ? I deleted all the R and mysql instances I found on my Mac and re-installed R from CRAN, but the problem remains.

It has nothing to do with those -- it is your user setting. It could be in your environment (try set | grep PKG) or any startup files (.Rprofile, .Renviron or any of the site-configuration files of .R/Makevars and friends ..).

Simon

I'm having basically the same problem (at least to the extent that the  
error message on attempted loading is the same), but would add that  
rgl _was_ working with R 2.14.2 until I updated to the current version  
from rgl 0.87 in a failed effort at answering posting on  
StackOverflow. (I have tried reverting to rgl 0.87 without success.) I  
have had problems in th past related to difference in freetype and  
libpng This is, however, probably a Mac specific issue and should get  
posted to the Mac list rather than the general R help list. I am  
alternate-posting (correct term doubtful) this and do not think it  
appropriate to respond to further replies on R-help.

I generally run the Mac R GUI 64 bit and installed both from binary  
and source (with Xcode installed) using the Package Installer, and get  
the same error message at the point of loading. I get the following  
warnings during installation from source using teh Mac GUI Package  
Installer with a target of rgl 0.92.861 and with the version that was  
current as a couple of days ago 0.92.858 :

No, not without more details from you - as Steve already told you. You should check your installer log (Windows->Installer Log) and provide the details.

Cheers,

Hi David,

I had a similar problem, with install.packages(rgl, type="source") complaining that

This was caused by a (very) old freetype in /usr/local/lib and went away after upgrading it. I replaced it with a current version from macports (I guess you could also use the version from their sourceforge page), although that is probably not the official solution.

In your case it looks like libpng, libX11, and libZ also need to be upgraded.

Best,
Jochen

Below some more observations that might help you locate the problem.

Also sorry for ignoring the posting rules in my last post. I was still on 2.14.1, and installing from source from the GUI version of R64. Installing from source from R64 GUI still works after the upgrade to R 2.14.2, . 

The 32 bit versions of R don't work for me anymore, probably because I have only installed the 64 bit versions of some libraries under Lion. I have never noticed before, since after the problem discussed in this thread https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-mac/2010-July/007609.html I have been using R64 exclusively.

Also note that installing from the command line (Terminal) version of either R32 or R64 gives the error 

> checking for glEnd in -lGL... no
> configure: error: missing required library GL

Presumably, something is wrong with my bash environment and the configure script is picking up the wrong gl libraries.
Installing from source does work after downloading and unzipping the rgl tarball with

./configure --with-gl-libs=/usr/X11/lib --with-gl-includes=/usr/X11/include

(I have tried reverting to rgl 0.87 without success.) I have had problems in th past related to difference in freetype and libpng This is, however, probably a Mac specific issue and should get posted to the Mac list rather than the general R help list. I am alternate-posting (correct term doubtful) this and do not think it appropriate to respond to further replies on R-help.

I get the following warnings during installation from source using teh Mac GUI Package Installer with a target of rgl 0.92.861 and with the version that was current as a couple of days ago 0.92.858 :
