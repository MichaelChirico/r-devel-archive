Message-ID: <8085B038-A10C-443B-854A-4738923F0C29@sauder.ubc.ca>

Hi All,

In R 2.3.X vintage setting options(htmlhelp=TRUE) in my .Rprofile  
caused help files to be displayed in an external web browser.  
However, under R 2.4.1, help files still come through the R-GUIs help  
browser when the htmlhelp=TRUE option is set. Is it still possible to  
have help pages shown in an external web browser, and if so, how does  
one do that?

Hi,

Does anyone succeed in installing RXLisp on intel Mac OS X 10.4.8  
Tiger ?
I often use XLispstat on my intel mac.  I would be happy if it could  
be used as R library.
I have installed xlispstat on my intel mac.

export XLISP_SRC_DIR=/Users/kamakura/work/xlispstat-3-52-20/
sudo R CMD INSTALL -configure-arg='-with-build-dll' RXLisp

Toshinari,

you may want to contact the package maintainer, because RXLisp  
doesn't work on a OS X out of the box. After a bunch of hacks I have  
succeeded in compiling it and get it to load, but it's still not very  
useful, because it is still missing something at the Lisp level.  
Anyway, attached, you'll find a commented shell script that can be  
used to build the whole thing.

Cheers,
Simon

Toshinari,

you have to initialize XLisp with its workspace, otherwise it will be  
missing all the functions that are defined there. There are sevarl  
ways to make it work (e.g. one is to run it directly from the  
xlispstat directory). Probably the simplest way to do that is:

1) copy the xlisp workspace into RXLisp:

cp /tmp/xlispstat-3-52-20/xlisp.wks /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/ 
Resources/library/RXLisp/xlisp/

2) initialize xlisp accordingly:

.XLispInit(c("xlisp",paste("-w",system.file 
("xlisp","xlisp.wks",package="RXLisp"),sep='')))

Alternatively you can set .XLispInitArgs somewhere for good:
.XLispInitArgs = c("xlisp",paste("-w",system.file 
("xlisp","xlisp.wks",package="RXLisp"),sep=''))

Cheers,
Simon

Hi there,

Anybody knows what happened to the nightly builds of R-devel?

  http://r.research.att.com/

Last build was on February 25th.

Any idea when they're gonna be back? Thanks!

Best,

Message-ID: <C22426AA.508D1%tim.bates@ed.ac.uk>

Is it appropriate to make suggestions for R.app here?


I think the value of the command history would be greatly enhanced if a
search box was added (probably as the last line in the command history),
such that text entered into the box filters the command list for matching
commands.


You can see how this would look by going to Safari:

1. type cmd-opt-B to open the book marks window
2. type some text in the search filter box at the bottom of the window

It does a live filter based on finding your text in the url and name of
bookmarked and history pages.

Um  ... when I was checking yesterday it had the 3/17 build online  
and today it's up to date as well... I remember vaguely that R-devel  
was broken for a few days. You may want to check the log - it is  
there even if build is not up there.

I'm using an Intel Core Duo.


I've attached the crash.log below.  Any suggestions.  Thank you.

Thanks, Ken, very nice bug report. I think I have the culprit. It's  
in the GUI, so please install the R GUI from the nightly build tomorrow.

Thanks,
Simon

Hello fellow R users!

I'm currently serving as a committee member at MacResearch.org, a  
website devoted to science, math, and statistics on  Macs. In about  
two weeks, we'll be visiting Apple to talk about issues, needs,  
desires of science users and developers:
http://www.macresearch.org/ 
macresearch_science_related_requests_for_apple

So I was writing to ask if you have particular questions or concerns  
which I can proxy? I think this is particularly important, since none  
of the other MacResearch representatives are statistics folks. (I'm a  
chemist -- I'm a happy user of R for data exploration and analysis.)

For example, are all the R.app compiler problems solved? Do we need  
graphing/plotting libraries for visualization from Apple? What  
feedback can I pass along?

Many thanks,
-Geoff

hello,

I don't have a R- specific issue. what I _can_ say is, that for Macs to be
accepted in scientific environments it's mandatory, that the bare bones UNIX
side of OSX, notably full screen X11 is working competitivly to, say, LINUX or
FreeBSD machines. for scientific purposes I find the combination of some Aqua
apps and many X11 apps and UNIX utilities especially helpful and superior to
using anything else.

right now X11 is OK (but not optimal), but I don't know, how the future support
for that area will look like.

so if you could transport the message, that many many tools require X11 and
many scientists are UNIX 'addicts', this might help (although they sshould know).

what I have noted is, that e.g. manpage support is no good: it seems that
quite a few of them are out of sync with the actual state of affairs.

one specific wish would be a 'canonical' rsync supporting HFS+ stuff, such
as aliases, too. (they did it with `cp', for instance). same for other UNIX
utilities which copy data (dd, tar, ...).

I've been generally pleased with OS X. My main problem (not so much R
related) is that many of the scientific applications I would like to run on
my machine don't like the UNIX "based" operating system and require
significant tweaking in order to get them to compile correctly (if I can get
them running at all). It would be nice if OS X behaved more like standard
UNIX or LINUX.

Best,
Randy

Hi,

Let me second Joerg van den Hoff's call for better X11 support. I'm  
using R via a modified version of the R Commander GUI (that uses the  
tcltk package, which requires X11 on the OS X platform) in a couple  
of different classes. One thing that I found frustrating is that  
Apple seems to be going to greater lengths overtime to hide the  
X11user.pkg. This makes installing R on OS X seem really complicated  
to students. The installation of the course software is comparatively  
much more straightforward on the Windows side, leaving the  
unfortunate impression that Windows is more suited to statistical  
computing.

I'm a bit puzzled about the X11-related statements here. Both  
mentioned "better X11 support" - what is really missing in Apple's  
X11? So far I have found Apple's X11 very enjoyable for all  
scientific purposes and much easier to work with that other 3rd-party  
X11 implementations.

As for installing X11, yes, I would welcome if it was in included the  
standard install mode, but it is in no way hidden: all Mac OS X  
installation DVDs have it and you only have to start the Mac OS X  
installer - one double-click, that's all. (Besides, rumor has it that  
this may change for Leopard anyway.) For a class, why not just supply  
the package?

Concerning R itself, my only worry (and a big headache) is the lack  
of Fortran support in Xcode. We have to install parallel compilers  
and system libraries which is a maintenance nightmare...

Cheers,
Simon

Although better X11 support may be a step ahead for now, it is
a step in the wrong direction. Years ago we already had support
for Aqua Tcl/Tk in command-line R using the infamous event loop
hack. So what must be done is make sure both R.app and command-line
R support Aqua Tcl/Tk -- which is not something Apple can do.
R core has to tweak the event loop mechanism, and then we can all
get rid of the last vestiges of X11.

hear, hear ! this is a continuing battle with Apple,
they maintain they do not have the expertise to support
gfortran, but i guess they do not want to offend several
third parties

as I said, the current state of X11 seems OK to me. it's in the bits and pieces
were some things could need a caring hand and generally, my mail was more a
pledge to keep X11 support in focus in the future. specifically, I mentioned
the 'sync' between utility/command and manpage and partly even missing manpage
(no example at hand, I only notice them by and then when really searching for
something).

more generally, I'm also concerned with command line support in such a way
that HFS+ specifics are handled gracefully in all cases.

another example is behaviour of `.Xauthority': completely unreproducible
but with finite probability (say every two weeks) my G5 comes up from sleep
and the X11 server refuses access so I can't open a new xterm, say. only copying
over the old state of .Xauthority from the evening before (which I have
started to copy via a script prior to sleep) reestablishes the access.
I'm not sure, if this is a specific mac problem, but it looks that way.

regards,

joerg

I would strongly object. concerning R itself, it's great that simon and the
others maintain a package which I can easily install on the mac (thanks!). 

but I myself (and probably many others) are no friends of GUIs, mainly
because I'm happy if I can use `readline' and edit the command line
and use incremental reverse search  etc. the same way in all programmms.
faster for me. 

so I exclusively use R from the command line. and actually
I do that in full screen X11 mode with my favorite x11 manager and everything
goes much faster than it would in the combination R GUI plus aqua. for me.

so why argue against it? sure, many novice users, maybe also 'professional'
users, will prefer the R GUI and that's fine with me, but it's sure not a superior
approach in any way that would make sense to me.

I am not arguing for the R.app GUI. I never use it myself,
excellent though it is.

I was arguing for Aqua Tcl/Tk from Carbon Emacs/ESS or from
Terminal.app.

To be fair, I don't expect Apple to officially support
Fortran. It WOULD be really nice, if they made sure they
didn't break the G95 compiler with their other GCC changes
and provided it unsupported as an optional Xcode tool from
available on their developer website.

I could live with that. Providing unsupported binaries would be  
great. Even just not breaking gfortran in their branch would be a  
huge step forward. It's not optimal (because we'd still have to deal  
with system updates), but better than the status quo.

Hi,

If it is not too difficult, I would like to request that it be made
easier to interrupt the package installer if, for example, the
local mirror is down.  I find that if my local mirror is down, that
when I try to look for packages, I get the spinning beach ball.
I haven't waited long enough to see if it stops with an error, but
I've waited several minutes which I think is a reasonable wait.  The
only way I've come up with for getting back control is by force quitting
R.  If there are less drastic ways, I'd like to learn them, but barring
that it would be nice to have better control of this.  Thank you.

best,

Ken

Have you tried pressing the Stop button in R (resp. pressing <Esc> in  
the console)? If that doesn't help, you can always issue
killall -INT R
in the Terminal which will stop this without quitting R. Currently, I  
know of no way around this, because R is single-threaded, so it's  
stuck in the connect call while the system waits for the host to  
respond, so it cannot even process keyboard or mouse events. If the  
host is invalid or your system already detected that the host is  
down, then there is no timeout and this is then no issue. If anyone  
can think of a solution for this, let me know...

Cheers,
Simon

Hi Simon,

When this happens, I can't access the Stop button and Esc does not respond
because of the spinning ball (or maybe not because, but you know what I mean,
I hope...).  I didn't know about the killall command, so I'll try that the
next
time I run into this.  Thanks for the suggestion.

best,

Ken

Gorazd,

thanks for the suggestion. Unfortunately it doesn't solve the  
problem. There are two reasons:

1) the myWinCtrl is not a local variable, it is an instance variable  
and as such RDocument manages its lifetime and therefore it is  
properly released in -(void)close. (note
		[self removeWindowController:myWinCtrl];
		[myWinCtrl close];
just before the hack and
		[myWinCtrl release];
		myWinCtrl=nil;
just after the hack.

2) even if we release myWinCtrl right away (albeit incorrectly so)  
the problem persists

I agree that there is something wrong, I just don't know what - the  
symptom is that the corresponding entry in the "Window" menu stays  
there and you can click on it and open the document again. So the  
hack fixes the symptom, but likely not the cause. If you have an idea  
what could cause the entry to stay in the list even though the window  
is closed, please let me know.

Thanks,
Simon

Hi,

For the last many versions of R (at least since v2, I think), I did  
not need to worry about getting R to output french accented vowels on  
my plots. I can place comments in french in my scripts without any  
problem. In fact things work so well I even started, now and then,  
using variable names with accents (so much prettier!).

Now I'm trying to introduce a student to R. Actually she'll need to  
use some of my programs (scripts) to analyse her data.

But all the accented vowels come up wrong on her copy of R (the  
default gui she got after installing R from CRAN)and worse, her R  
does not like one bit my variable names containing accents.

I know that on my mac, R is not happy if I don't save my programs and  
my data files in UTF8-no BOM (I'm not sure about the no BOM,  
sometimes R accepts files in UTF8 only, sometimes not, but it always  
accepts them if I set the no BOM encoding in TextWrangler).

I've never told R anything about what encoding to use, it chose UTF8  
no BOM all by itself.

I double-checked with these commands:
 > Sys.getlocale(category = "LC_ALL")
[1] "fr_CA.UTF-8/fr_CA.UTF-8/fr_CA.UTF-8/C/fr_CA.UTF-8/fr_CA.UTF-8"
 > getOption("encoding")
[1] "native.enc"
 > localeToCharset(locale = Sys.getlocale("LC_CTYPE"))
[1] "UTF-8"     "ISO8859-1"


I thought ISO8859-1 was the same as ISO-Latin 1, and tried again  
reading in a data file containing an accented vowel. R did not like it.

The student on a PC typed the same commands and got:

> Sys.getlocale(category = "LC_ALL")
>
[1]"LC_COLLATE=French_Canada.1252;LC_CTYPE=French_Canada. 
1252;LC_MONETARY=French_Canada. 
1252;LC_NUMERIC=C;LC_TIME=French_Canada.1252"


> getOption("encoding")
>
[1] "native.enc"


> localeToCharset(locale = Sys.getlocale("LC_CTYPE"))
>
[1] "ISO8859-1"


It seems that both our versions of R should handle ISO-Latin 1. Do  
you have enough details to tell me why mine does not seem to like ISO- 
Latin 1?

For the collaboration with my student to work (and for her not to  
give up on R), I need to either make my R accept to give me the same  
level of good services in French using ISO-Latin 1, or to tell my  
students's version of R on a PC to accept scripts and data files in  
UTF8.

Which of the two is easiest?

Thanks in advance,

Denis Chabot

Denis,

to be honest, I'm not quite sure I understand your problem. Therefore  
I'll just explain a bit how to work with encodings (you may also want  
to read Brian Ripley's article in R News).

First, the Mac GUI does everything in UTF-8. All files handled by the  
GUI are expected to be in UTF-8 and will be saved in UTF-8 (there is  
an exception for backwards compatibility - if a document to be read  
doesn't appear to be UTF-8, it is assumed to be MacRoman and will be  
converted to UTF-8 automatically) . If you want to read files in the  
GUI from encodings, you have to convert them first.

Now, R can read/write files in a variety of encodings, especially on  
the Mac. The fact that the Mac GUI is using UTF-8 makes it possible  
to display text in pretty much any encoding.

Let's say I have this code:
B?te <- "La B?te"
print(B?te)
in three files: txt-utf8.R as UTF-8 (default when you save it with  
the GUI), txt-mac.R (old Mac Roman encoding that is the default if  
you save it in TextEdit for example) and txt-lat1.R in latin1  
(ISO8859-1, default on Windows). They look like this:

caladan:urbanek$ hexdump -C txt-utf8.R
00000000  42 c3 aa 74 65 20 3c 2d  20 22 4c 61 20 42 c3 aa  |B..te <-  
"La B..|
00000010  74 65 22 0a 70 72 69 6e  74 28 42 c3 aa 74 65 29  |te".print 
(B..te)|
00000020  0a                                                |.|
00000021
caladan:urbanek$ hexdump -C txt-mac.R
00000000  42 90 74 65 20 3c 2d 20  22 4c 61 20 42 90 74 65  |B.te <-  
"La B.te|
00000010  22 0a 70 72 69 6e 74 28  42 90 74 65 29 0a        |".print 
(B.te).|
0000001e
caladan:urbanek$ hexdump -C txt-lat1.R
00000000  42 ea 74 65 20 3c 2d 20  22 4c 61 20 42 ea 74 65  |B.te <-  
"La B.te|
00000010  22 0a 70 72 69 6e 74 28  42 ea 74 65 29 0a        |".print 
(B.te).|

In the Mac GUI you can actually open both txt-utf8.R or txt-mac.R in  
the built-in editor and they'll be fine, because the MacRoman version  
will be automatically converted to UTF-8. But if you want to source  
the code, you have to specify the encoding. Only the txt-utf8.R file  
will work, others won't:

 > source("txt-utf8.R")
[1] "La B?te"
 > source("txt-lat1.R")
Error in source("txt-lat1.R") : invalid multibyte character in  
mbcs_get_next
 > source("txt-mac.R")
Error in source("txt-mac.R") : invalid multibyte character in  
mbcs_get_next

You have to tell R which encoding the file really uses:
 > source("txt-lat1.R",enc="latin1")
[1] "La B?te"
 > source("txt-mac.R",enc="MacRoman")
[1] "La B?te"
 > ls()
[1] "B?te"

The same applies to any other file operations (read/write.table, ..).  
R just has no way of knowing what the encoding of the file is.

Finally, if you want to convert files for other users (e.g. for their  
convenience), you have several options. Unfortunately the Mac GUI  
doesn't have the  option to save in a different encoding (yet), but  
you can use TextEdit or Xcode to open a file and save it in a  
different encoding. Alrernatively you can use iconv directly if you  
want to convert files in a batch, for example:
iconv -f utf-8 -t latin1 txt-utf8.R > txt-lat1.R

One word of caution - if you are *not* using the Mac GUI then R may  
not support non-ASCII characters at, for example:
LANG=C R
 > source("txt-lat1.R")
Error in parse(file, n = -1, NULL, "?") : syntax error at
1: B?

I hope this helps ...

Cheers,
Simon

I've just upgraded from a G4 to a Mac Pro, and copied all my files 
across using the Mac migration facility. R opens ok but throws up 
these two error messages. I've since reinstalled R but the errors 
remain.

See FAQ - this is not an R error, you have some old 3rd party  
software in your home that works only on PowerPC (MagicMenuEnabler  
and Smart Crash Reports it appears). You have to delete them or get  
versions that work on your new Mac.

Cheers,
Simon

Dear R Mac developers group,

I hope this question is appropriate for this list.

I'm a new user (a few months) and R has been great. Thank you!

If it's possible, I'd like to make a simple GUI or other front end to a 
few of my R scripts for my non-coding colleagues to use (or even little 
stand-alone apps.)

Could Automator or AppleScript, or something else, be used to do this? 
(I don't know either yet; looking at Automator it wasn't immediately 
clear to me whether or not it can talk to R.) Any recommendations 
appreciated!

Many thanks,
Linda Palmer

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac]  New user question
Message-ID: <C2307E5E.28F3%Beyerj@students.uni-marburg.de>

Hi Linda, 

I think there is currently no direct, easy and/or satisfying solution for
your scenario. The probably most convenient solution is to set up your
scripts in a way that they can be "source"d in via the menu command "File >
Source File...", which gives you a file selection dialog; R.app will then
generate a source()-command, read the selected file and execute the found
code. This is the same as _manually_ typing "source("path/to/R-script")" in
R.app's console window.

As for Automator, AppleScript and friends, the big picture is a bit more
complex (apologies if you already know that): The question is not in the
first place, whether Automator or AppleScript can accomplish this or that,
it rather depends on the scripting support an application offers. It's a
design decision made by the application's developer(s). No scripting support
in the application -- no scriptability; weak scripting support -- weak
scriptability; ... 

So the question is "Does R.app offer scripting support, and to which
extend?"  A look at R.app's AppleScript dictionary shows that the only
command that could be useful here is "cmd" to send and execute R-code. There
is no "source file" command or something comparable in R.app's scriptability
features. 

You could of course develop an AppleScript-, AppleScript Studio- or
Automator-based solution that simply uses R.app's "cmd" to build and send
"source("path/to/R-script")" commands and wrap some GUI elements around it.
But I doubt that such a solution would be worth the effort, and of course it
depends on the skills you already have with one of Apple's automation
technologies. 

BTW, some month ago I suggested to add a configurable script palette to
R.app's feature set (similar to the palettes in TextWrangler and BBEdit),
which would provide a way to easily select and execute script files. We will
have to wait and see what the future brings. It depends on whether or not
the developers of R.app find the idea useful, and of course whether they
find the time to implement it.

Hope this helps.

I've not done this myself, so I have only a general idea of what might work.

Applescript can execute unix shell scripts, so you could write a 
simple unix shell script that would run R in batch mode.
Actually, Applescript may be able to directly issue arbitrary unix 
commands, which in your case might be something like
    R < inputfile.r > outputile.txt
or maybe
    R CMD BATCH options infile  outfile
(type R CMD BATCH --help at a shell prompt)

I imagine that Applescript has commands for asking the user for 
input, which Applescript could then add to the batch command as 
options.

So I think something could be cobbled together. Might be kind of 
crude, but it should be usable.

Have you looked at the tcltk package?

Hi All,
R.app, as Jorg says, has very-very limited apple script support. I  
originally implemented it and it is very weak (for several reasons,  
e.g. no feedback is returned from the executed command; no synch, etc)
Any contribution to add more scriptability to R.app is welcome.

If it is just a matter of running R scripts, then going directly to  
R.app :File-> Source file is enough. You can also configure R to  
source scripts by default on drag&drop, which should be also an  
interesting shortcut.
Of course, you can create an applescript to source a script into R,  
i.e with something like "tell R.app cmd source(file)"

The tcltk package might be a solution but you need the user to  
install X11, which is usually not installed by default of OS X machines.

An alternative is to create a Cocoa app on top of the cmd line  
version of R for each of your ad-hoc scripts. There are several  
examples of Cocoa GUIs built on top of unix commands (i.e. mplayer,  
ffmpegx, etc)

Many thanks to everyone for your responses!

The information has all been very helpful. So I should be able to put 
something simple together now. (It is just script running, maybe with 
some options, but pathnames seem to make the biologists uneasy...) And 
maybe dream about getting fancy in the future with tcl/tk or Cocoa.

Thanks again!
Linda

Message-ID: <b724186f0703282050s3ccd259cs980d23c8dd6637b5@mail.gmail.com>

I'm a complete newbie using OS X 10.4.9 and R 2.4.1 GUI 1.18 (4038).
I'm trying to use R's package installer to install some packages.
Towards that end, I tried only to get a list of the packages.  I get
this error:

Error in gzfile(file, mode) : unable to open connection
In addition: Warning message:

2: installed.packages()

gzfile() works, so I'm not sure what's going on:

> gzfile("fEcofin_240.10067.tgz","rb")
            description                   class

                  "rb6"                "binary"
                 opened                can read
               "opened"                   "yes"
              can write
                   "no"

Any help?  Any ideas?  If there's any other information I can add, please ask.
