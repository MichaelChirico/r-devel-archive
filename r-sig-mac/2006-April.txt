aless is the command-line version of Aqualess, which
you can get as a universal binary from

http://aqualess.sourceforge.net/

It installs aless in /usr/bin, same as smultron and
bbedit have command line versions.

now add

options(pager="aless")

to your Rprofile, and even if you are using R from the
terminal (or Emacs) you will get output from help()
in a nice Aqua window.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Problems loading Java libraries in R 2.2.1 OS X 10.4.5,
 Java 1.5.0 rev 3
Message-ID: <4433EA21.7070105@gmx.de>

Hi list,

I have a PowerMac G5 running OS X 10.4.5 and Java 1.5.0 rev_3 together
with the precompiled R Version 2.2.1  (2005-12-20 r36812) from CRAN.

I tried to install a Bioconductor package called RMAGEML which depends
on an external Java-tool for data parsing and loading.

Compilation went fine after some configuration issues but the program
crashes with a "Bus error" while parsing testdata with the Java-module,
see below.

Debugging gave the following error message:

To me this looks like it uses the wrong library (1.3.1 instead of

but I have no clue how to change that.

I have set the preferences for Java apps to 1.4.2>1.5.0, so it should
not use 1.3.1 at all I think.

Software had to be compiled with gcc 3 via

dragonfish-g5:~ saric$ sudo gcc_select 3.3

Any idea?

I tend not to use the GUI for just this reason (and the fact it
doesn't support my favourite bash completion stuff).

It is trivial from the command line:

HTTP_PROXY=.... R

And you can set up an alias in ~/.profile if needed.

There are several ways to set environment variables for specific  
applications, but this is probably the most widely used one:

Marc,

I have no idea about RMAGEML, but in general the Java version is  
determined by the compiler flags used. If the configure script is  
reasonable, it should be using -framework JavaVM to link to JNI in  
which case the used version is determined solely by the
/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/CurrentJDK
softlink.
Quick check shows that RMAGEML is one of the few BioC packages that  
fails to build on OS X, because its configure script is nether  
checking nor detecting Java. I'd recommend you to talk to the  
maintainer. Java detection is now part of several packages (e.g.  
rJava on CRAN) and also R itself, so it should not be hard to fix it.  
Of course, chances are that compiler flags are just one part of the  
problem, and the segfault is caused by something else, but better  
start fixing things from the bottom ;).

Cheers,
Simon

And I guess you can put it in .Renviron which contains environment  
variables being set when you run R. I am not sure however that the  
Rgui reads that file? I know there are ways to run R without the file  
being read - I think R CMD BATCH is one of them.

That's exactly what I thought after my initial try to compile the
package did not work (except that it was not clear to me wether the
"CurrentJDK" link was the only place where things could go wrong).

So I did check my setup:

lrwxr-xr-x    1 root  wheel    3 Nov  8 10:47 CurrentJDK -> 1.5

which in turn points to 1.5.0, so this should be correct.

You are right here, the package does not check for the correct Java
automatically, but has to be forced to do it correctly. I managed to
compile it by unpacking the tar.gz and hand-editing

RMAGEML/src/Makevars (and Makevars.perm and Makevars.in) so that it
looks like this

# for macosx of 3/05
#
PKG_CPPFLAGS=-I/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Headers
PKG_LIBS=-framework JavaVM

after that it compiled (actually this code was in the Makevars script
allready and just had to be uncommented -a more clever Makevars should
fix this).

At least the PKG_CPPFLAGS points to

lrwxr-xr-x    1 root  wheel   24 Apr  5 14:56 Headers ->
Versions/Current/Headers

which should be ok (see above).

Will have a closer look at the CPPFLAGS and LIBS settings and try to
find out some more stuff about Java on Mac and try again.

P.S. Got mail from the original author, he mentions that no one tried to
compile it on Mac so far -might become interresting. :-)

The only problem I had with using .Renviron was that the
setting for R_LIBS (which I set in that file) was not
available to the command line invocations for running
check and INSTALL.

But even that is easily fixed as the format of .Renviron
is the same as that of POSIX shell .profile. So in your
.profile, import the desired portion of the R environment
to your shell as well. This solution works on Mac OS X as
well as any Un*x-based setup.



--------------------- .Renviron --------------------------
###
### .Renviron - R environment variables
###

R_LIBS=~/Library/R/library
R_NO_UNDERLINE=1
R_PAPERSIZE=letter
STRICT_R_HEADERS=1


--------------------- .profile ---------------------------
###
### .profile - POSIX shell personal initialization
###

... whatever initialization code exists ...

##
## Setup R
##
export $( grep R_LIBS .Renviron )

Haven't looked at whatever package you're referring to
but if it's attempting to import something and choking,
perhaps there's a dependency you've overlooked.

Just a quick warning: this works only for the login shell, but not  
for anything else (including the R GUI, xterm, Emacs, etc.). This was  
Doug's point - .profile is useless for this. Even system profile is  
not run in xterm (surprise), Emacs or R-GUI, so you have to be very  
careful where you set the variables. The .MacOSX/environment.plist  
albeit less flexible has the advantage of applying to all  
applications launched by LS, so that's pretty much everywhere except  
for remote invocations. Of course, anything you start manually from  
the shell will inherits the environment, but not if 'open' is used.

Cheers,
Simon

Cool! You could augment that by adding your personal
library(*) to the mix as:

spotlight <- function(word) {
    system(sprintf("mdfind -onlyin %s -onlyin %s %s | %s",
                   file.path(R.home(),
                             "library"),
                   file.path(path.expand("~"),
                             "Library",
                             "R",
                             "library"),
                   word,
                   getOption("pager")),
           intern = TRUE)
}


*) mdfind doesn't take a directory path (as one might
expect) and repeating the 'onlyin' argument augments
the search location rather than overrides. What a unique
implementation...

True. I just run my "check" and "INSTALL" from Terminal.app
so this has never caused me any issues. And on regular Un*x,
xterm would have been launched by the shell. Since R.app
reads .Renviron anyway, this method has been adequate for
my multi-environment needs; if you use other Mac OS X
applications, the Mac-specific environment.plist route
is the way to go.

Must admit to being surprised about 'open' though. Would
have thought that (when run from Terminal.app) would have
passed on the shell's environment.

No, that's not quite true - it's launched by the wm which in turn is  
launched by X11, so it is not started by the shell (login shell to be  
more precise) and thus never read .profile. However, depending on  
your X11 setup, you can tell xterm to process .profile, but the  
default setting for Apple X11 is not to (and it's default for some  
other unix systems, too).

If .Renviron is sufficient, that's fine, but as others were pointing  
out, R_LIBS for example must be set before that.

I must admit that you got me there :). In fact `open' actually passes  
the parent environment to the LS, although the documentation says the  
otherwise - interesting. Thanks for that one - this is definitely  
handy for testing things ...

Hi All,

first of all, for those subscribed to bioc, my apologies for the 
cross-post.

i've been trying to build BioC packages on macosx, but i can't get it to work. 
i got rid of fink and installed the g77 that comes with R binary. then i built 
and installed the latest devel version of R using the sequence ./configure && 
make && make install

i built R-2.3.0 from the source (which is the one in my PATH), but when I 
try:

R CMD build Biobase/

from my svn dir, this is what i get (even if i use absolute paths):

** arch - Frameworks
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/share/make/shlib.mk:3: 
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/etc/Frameworks/Makeconf: No such file

`/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/etc/Frameworks/Makeconf'. Stop.
chmod: /private/tmp/Rinst1800553001/Biobase/libs/Frameworks/*: No such file or

suggestions on how to proceed?

Message-ID: <17466.31258.399812.713022@polaris.biostat.wisc.edu>

I sent the following message out a few weeks ago regarding the
disappearance of the R prompt.  I didn't get any responses, but I've
done some more digging and here's what I found out.  In the source
file main.c there is a routine defined as follows:

char *R_PromptString(int browselevel, int type)
{
    if (R_Slave) {
	BrowsePrompt[0] = '\0';
	return BrowsePrompt;
    }
    else {
	if(type == 1) {
	    if(browselevel) {
		sprintf(BrowsePrompt, "Browse[%d]> ", browselevel);
	  .
	  .
	  .

I replaced the `if(R_Slave) {' with `if(0) {' (forcing execution of
the `else' clause) and recompiled and the prompt problem I described
is fixed.  Apparently `R_Slave' is being set (at least of the purpose
of this routine) even though I don't run R with the `--slave' option.
On the other hand, other output normally suppressed by `--slave' still
shows up (and it asks about saving the workspace when I exit), so this
behavior doesn't seem to be global.  Of course, now if I run R with
the `--slave' option, other output is suppressed, but I still get the
prompt, however, since I don't have a reason to use `--slave' at this
moment, this is not a problem for me.

My c skills are pretty rudimentary, so I have no idea what could be
causing this problem in the first place.  Even though I'm now back up
and running, this is clearly the wrong fix.  Any idea what the root
cause is and what the right fix is?

Thanks,

Tom

Hello,
I am having difficulty getting R to work on my Mac OS X 10.4.6 powerbook G4 
and also with downloading emacs. I have been able to download the R but when 
I double click the icon I get a page with the copyright info and a few 
commands about license and to quit, etc. Executing the 'help.start()' 
command from that screen, opens another window with manuals, reference, etc. 
Could anyone help me to get R working with the partition screen from emacs 
on my computer? Or does the Mac have a better editor that I could use to 
navigate through R. I will most appreciate that. Thanks!

 From your description it seems to work: you do just not start R with  
Emacs in this fashion. Emacs is - in my opinion - an extremely good  
editor for use with R, because of the way the help system and other  
things interact with Emacs. However, if you have never used Emacs  
before it will also be along hard road - it takes a _long_ time to be  
familiar with Emacs. Rest assured that you will be (very) frustrated  
at times until you suddenly get it :)

Nevertheless, here is an easy walk through to get R and Emacs to work

1) Download R from CRAN. Install it (while you are at it, remember to  
choose "customize" during installation and install g77 and the tcl/tk  
stuff. This will give you R inside your application folder, which you  
can click on to start. Doing so yields a "standard" R editor.

2) Now you need to install Emacs. There are various versions. I use  
"Carbon" Emacs which is a version of Emacs for Mac which is Unix-like  
in its behaviour. There is also AquaEmacs (google it) which is more  
Mac-centric. I choose Carbon Emacs because I want keyboard shortcuts  
etc. to behave in the same way across platforms - I frequently use  
Unix-like systems. Get Carbon Emacs from here
http://homepage.mac.com/zenitani/emacs-e.html
Install it like any other application. Again you get an application  
you start like any other application.

3) Now it is time to get ESS (Emacs speaks statistics) working. This  
is a package for Emacs which makes Emacs works nicely with R (and  
other stuff). Fortunately, Carbon Emacs comes with ESS installed (you  
may have to install it under AquaEmacs). We just need to activate it.  
In order to do so, use a text editor (eg. Text Edit) to open up a file
   ~/.emacs
(~ = your home directory)
This is your Emacs configuration file. In that file you place the  
following line
(require 'ess-site)
You should now be able to start Emacs without any error messages. If  
you get an error message, you have probably mistyped something.

4) Start up Emacs and type
   M-x R
(you do this by holding either the ALT or the APPLE key down while  
you press x. Then you see "M-x" in Emacs. You type R and return.
You should now see R open up inside emacs. Have fun and type a few  
commands.

5) Finally we need to get graphics working. Open up the file
   ~/.profile
and enter the following line
export DISPLAY=:0.0
You should now be able to plot graphics from the inside of Emacs

Further discussion of ESS/Emacs should be directed at the ESS list.

I think Kasper means Aquamacs Emacs.  It comes with ESS as well.

http://aquamacs.org/

I would recommend Aquamacs over Carbon emacs.  It is the easy to use  
and the developers have gone out of their way to ensure that the user  
experience is consistent with Mac OS X.  It's a better OS X citizen  
than Carbon Emacs.

To get ESS working on Aquamacs you need to first load the ess package  
with the command:

M-x R-mode (Alt/Option + X, then type R-mode and press enter) will  
start ESS

then M-x R (Alt/Option + X, then type R and press enter) will start R  
inside an emacs buffer.

You'll need to have Darwin X11 running to get proper graphics  
working.  As far as I have experienced with Aquamacs, you don't need  
to play with any configuration files to get it work.

You could also get limited graphics without X11, by using the quartz 
() device.  Due to the way R and Emacs interact, you won't be able to  
interact with these plots.

Benjamin,

Emacs and ESS is a powerful way to write and run R code. However, given the
nature of your question, you may want to use R.app for your analyses. You
started this application when you double-clicked the R icon. Choose 'New
Document' from the file menu and you have a code window with syntax
highlighting and autocomplete. Apple-return sends any highlighted code to the
R console and all plot code is sent to an aqua window in the OS X-native pdf
format. Be sure to look at the 'R for Mac OS X FAQ' under the Help menu of
R.app

Good luck, Matt

Not any time really soon.  However, R does benefit from dual processors on 
other systems and so presumably will on the macbooks, just because R can 
occupy one processor and all the other user overhead can be on the other.

First be sure that you have downloaded the latest version of R for
mac. Follow the MacOS X binaries link and download:
R-2.2.1-universal.dmg, then make a custom installation including both
g77 and tcl/tk.

If everything is OK, you should be able to find R on Applications and
all its libraries on /Library/Frameworks.

R comes with its own editor so you really do not need and external
editor. Besides you have the advantage of having help with the
commands options, the workspace browser and installing new packages.
With apple+return you pass instructions from the internal editor to
the console.

If you want to use an external editor, Aquamacs is a very good option.
Once R is already installed. Download Aquamacs, install and follow
previous instructions (read above message) to activate the graphics
window. Then, open Aquamacs and choose: File/New Buffer/R from the
menu and thats it. On the top of the window you will see the R icon.
Click on the icon and you will have an R session. One of the icons
lets you pass instructions from the editor to the R buffer.

As Thomas pointed out dual core is always a win (once you work on a  
dual machine you will never go back to single CPU/core voluntarily).

Also R for Intel Macs comes with ptATLAS tuned for the Core Duo, so  
it uses both cores in parallel for BLAS operations. (Which may or may  
not be helpful depending on the problem at hand). Also note that  
there are ways to parallelize computations in R as well (c.f. snow  
package).

Cheers,
Simon

Dear Mac users,

universal nightly builds of the R 2.3 release candidate for Mac OS X  
are now available as binaries  for testing. Please visit

http://R.research.att.com/

and look for R23-patched or R-rc. You will need Mac OS X 10.4.4 or  
higher. Some binary CRAN packages are also available, use the above  
URL as the repository (i.e. install.packages("foo",,"http:// 
R.research.att.com/") ). The packages are just being built, so check  
later if your package is not there yet.

Please report any issues you encounter directly to me - preferably  
before the release ;).

Thanks and happy testing,

^^^- this is the actual error - it seems that something went wrong  
during the compilation, but you omitted that part, so we can't see  
what that was. Please send me the full output of the build process.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Building package to use OpeNDAP libraries
Message-ID: <p0621020cc06d88fa9343@[128.115.153.6]>

I trying to help someone install a package that uses the OpeNDAP 
libraries (http://www.opendap.org/), and I need to verify a couple of 
things.

We're working with OS X 10.4.6 and R 2.2.1.

The opendap project supplies OS X installers (.dmg files) for the 
libraries, but we have learned that they were built with gcc 4.0.0.

-- 1 --
The current R binary on CRAN was built with gcc_select 3.3 in place 
(or 3.something, at least) ?
(both the powerpc version, and the universal version if installed on 
a powerpc machine?)

-- 2 --
Regardless of any other issues, this compiler version mismatch will 
prevent us from building a working package. Right?

I believe the answers are yes, and yes, and if so I expect the next 
step is to download the opendap sources and build the libraries using 
gcc 3.3.

Thanks

Yes, that is already better :). However, those should be just  
warnings, not errors - does affyplier.so exist? Once R is started,  
the DYLIB_LIBRARY_PATH is set and dyld should find the libraries.

If not, then it really depends on your compilers - check libR.dylib  
and the others in /usr/local/lib64/R/lib with otool64 -L to see where  
they are actually expected. If in doubt, send me the output of
otool64 -L /usr/local/lib64/R/lib/*
and
otool64 -L /usr/local/lib/libg*

Cheers,
Simon

Yes. This will change for R 2.3.0 (see the nightly builds).

Not necessarily. If OpeNDAP libraries use ABIs that don't differ  
between 3.3. and 4.0 then it should work. Note that you still have to  
compile the R package with gcc 3.x, however the library it is linking  
to doesn't always have to be compiled with gcc 3.x.

Cheers,
Simon

Thanks Simon.

Everything fell into place when I compiled the OPeNDAP libraries from 
source, using gcc 3.3, so in this case a match is necessary.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Rgraphviz neato layout crashes
Message-ID: <444826F1.7020405@ucdavis.edu>

Hello,

I am having a problem with Rgraphviz

When I try to plot a graph using the "neato" layout, R crashes with a bus error.  I am posting to this list because I can not reproduce this on a Windows machine.  (but I can reproduce it on multiple macs).

This crash can be reproduced just following the example at the beginning of the Rgraphviz vignette.  Has anyone else had this problem?  Any suggested solutions?

Thanks,

Julin

ps OS 10.4.6, Dual 2.5 G5, 4GB RAM.  Graphviz 2.8, compiled from source.  Rgraphviz 1.8, compiled from source.
pps crash happens both from R.app using quartz and from command line or EMACS using X11.

What I am going to say is not really helpful :) When I tried  
installing graphviz some time ago (around Christmas) I had big  
problems getting it to work. In the end I settled for v2.7 (I guess  
that was before 2.8 came out, the odd numbers are devel versions). I  
remember some of my attempts actually compiled, Rgraphviz compiled  
but I was unable to plot like you are (although I do not remember if  
I used neato or something else). So I have encountered the problem of  
a crash even with successful installations of graphviz/Rgraphviz. I  
looked at my old config-log and the only thing (aside from mandirs  
and such) is --disable-codegens which - again as far as I recall -  
was there just to ensure compilation.

If you are installing from the binary obtained from CRAN, choose  
"customize" during installation. That will give you the option of  
installing the tcltk stuff. And while you are at it, grab the g77 as  
well. And you probably also want to use gcc 3.3, by giving the command
   sudo gcc_select 3.3
in the terminal. The last two advices have nothing to do with tcl/tk  
however.

it have a library folder :  grasslib  that is installed   in   /usr/ 
local
there are other usefool binary packages
  alias libgrass and graphicslib at  http://www.kyngchaos.com/macosx/ 
downloads.php

if i wont install the R-spatial-packages (rgdal, spproy, and other)
how can i use the lib-binary folder ,   to resolve the dependencie  
issue for rgdal and other packages ?
is it possible ?

if is not possible, what are the source library that i must install

Dear Simon

It seems there is the affyplier.so in the directory.
When I start R64 and try to dyn.load
 > dyn.load("/Research/GEO_CEL/pliersrc/affyplier.so")
Segmentation fault

DYLIB_LIBRARY_PATH was set in .tcshrc as
DYLIB_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib64/R/lib

Thank you very much for the helps!!!

I thought so - what you saw were just warnings, not errors - nothing  
really wrong with that.

Ah, that's more interesting - chances are that it's a problem in the  
package itself. Please run
R64 -d gdb
in gdb type "run", then load the library to see what happens
once you have the crash, type "bt" to see where is crashed.

Cheers,

Dear Simon

Does  "/Users/skong/libR.dylib" (file not found).  mean that there's  
missing symbolic link to libR.dylib ?

Message-ID: <20060424131941.2777.qmail@web31612.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

dear mac-users,

i'm on mac osx 10.4.6 (x11, x-code-2.2.1,
Grass-6.1.dmg, R-2.2.1.dmg)

i must install  rgdal (needed for spgrass6)

for this thigs, i must build gdal from source
( beacouse i can't use the libgrass inside /usr/local/
  right?)

can i install gdal source code  with a simple  
"./configure  -  make  -  sudo make install" ?

does R - grass (by spgrass6 connection) works fine if
i've only the 6.1cvs.dmg  installed on grass folder ?

sorry for my newbie questions.
thanks for any suggestion!

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Help with locale on OS X
Message-ID: <p06210202c072f902d9cb@[128.115.153.6]>

For several years I've been running scripts with this expression

   substr(tmp.un[substr(tmp.un,1,1)=='u'],1,1) <- '\265'

whose purpose is to replace the letter 'u' with a 
Greek mu, to change, for example,  'ug/L' to 
'?g/L'. It has been working over several versions 
of R.

Recently, I started (sometimes?) getting error messages from the expression:

>  substr(tmp.un[substr(tmp.un,1,1)=='u'],1,1) <- '\265'
Error in "substr<-"(`*tmp*`, 1, 1, value = "<b5>") :
         invalid multibyte string

In the same R session:

>  Sys.getlocale()
[1] "C/en_US.UTF-8/C/C/C/C"

Yet, in another R session on the same machine (in a different directory)

>  Sys.getlocale()
[1] "C"

If I go back to the first session, that had the problem, and do
    > Sys.setlocale('LC_ALL','C')
then the error goes away. This is good.

But I have no idea why the locale is apparently 
getting set wrong; I don't believe I ever 
explicitly wrote a "set locale" expression of any 
sort anywhere in the scripts for this project. 
Maybe it's a side effect of something, but I 
don't know what.

Any suggestions would be most appreciated.

Thanks

With high probability this is due to UTF-8 locale being used. You can  
check that easily by looking for
"Natural language support but running in an English locale"
in the greeting.

Starting with R 2.3.0 (due to updated gettext) the locale is  
determined from the system settings. Previously, the system setting  
was always ignored. Right now it is used if no other locale setting  
is set, such as LANG, LC_ALL etc. If you want to force C locale, you  
should run your scripts using something like
LANG=C R
and this is what most scripts do if they want to force no-locale  
environment. Note, however, that UTF-8 is required by the system  
utilities, so forcing a non-UTF-8 locale will prevent you from using  
non-ASCII characters in file names or etc. On Mac OS X is it usually  
safer to write everything in UTF-8 including your scripts.

Hi All,

I searched through the list archives but I did not find a simple yes/ 
no aswer: given that I have a PPC Mac (OS 10.4.6) with R 2.2.1 (and  
looking forward to update to R 2.3), with the g77 and Tcl/Tk packages  
installed from the R dmg, can I safely migrate from XCode 2.1 to  
XCode 2.2? I do all the package installation from the R GUI.

Cheers,

Federico

For R 2.3.0 it's a simple yes. (The image should be on CRAN later  
today).
For R 2.2.1 it's a no-so-simple yes, because may have to add - 
lSystemStubs to package LIBS.

I will keep things simple and wait for R 2.3.0 then.

Hi Folks,
I can't install any R binaries any more, and have always done so in

anything called Apple Installer on my machine (if I am supposed to  
have/see that...)?

My machine details follow. Any and all thoughts are appreciated.

If you don't have Installer.app in /Applications/Utilities then
indeed you cannot open mpkg files. If you do have it, then your
LaunchServices database is broken -- try dropping the mpkg on
Installer.app

Yes, it should be
/Application/Utilities/Installer.app

If you don't have it, that's definitely bad. Possibly you can pull it  
off the OS X Installation CD - it's living in /Application/Utilities  
there as well (directly in the root of the CD) - just drag it to your  
disk. Also try to look in your Trash.

Cheers,
Simon

FWIW: it this case you can probably still use the command-line  
version. It can be used like this:

sudo installer -pkg R.mpkg -target /

Hi

[sending here after trying R-help and ess-help with
no success]

With R-2.3.0 (dmg downloaded just now), ess-5.3.0:
  trying to open an X11 graphics window with
X11("octopus:0.0") results in R crashing:


 > X11("octopus:0.0")
Error: Couldn't find per display information

Process R exited abnormally with code 1 at Fri Apr 28 14:05:06 2006




(typing "X11()" doesn't crash, but doesn't open an X window either).

The situation is fine running R from an xterm.  I can
open a window with either X11() or X11("octopus:0.0") from
within an Xterm R session.

I can also open a window fine from R-2.2.1 from within emacs.

Can someone help me diagnose this problem?

Please start the Console application (Utilities->Console) and then  
run the R GUI. After it closes, you should see some new messages in  
the console log (if you don't see the choice of logs, click on the  
"Logs" symbol in the toolbar), please send me that output.

If that doesn't quite work for you, there is an alternative - just  
open the Terminal (Utilities->Terminal) and copy/paste this there:
cd /Applications/R.app/Contents/MacOS/
./R

And send me the full output.

I tried last evening on my PPC powerbook with OS 10.4.6, and the GUI did 
nothing, i.e. it did not crash in 20 minutes or more, but I did not use 
the GUI, I just let it run stay to see if it would crash.

Best,

Obviously, I was using the new R 2.3.0 universal dmg. I also upgraded 
XCode to 2.2. if that makes any difference.

I think there's been a change in R regarding when and how you define the
display.  Instead of within the X11() command, you need to type first, at the R
prompt:

> Sys.putenv("DISPLAY"=":0")

Hope this helps/works.

Hi,

I updtated to R 2.3 yesterday, along with the new version of R.app. I  
launched it and installed packages without problem.

Today I tried to do real work. I opened a relatively large R dataset  
(8.9 M, over 30000 rows). I then opened a work space explorer window,  
and clicked on the large dataframe to see the variable in it. R  
crashed. Here is the log.

Thanks for looking into it,

Denis

Problem #1 - the repository you try doesn't have the packages - try  
the main CRAN site first and then some other mirror near you.

Problem #2 - it shouldn't crash. Strangely enough this crash happens  
even with old builds of R as well. I have traced it down to  
localization of the HTTP code, but can't figure out why it should  
die. Minimal reproducible code is

download.file("http://www.google.com/foo","/tmp/foo")

(the site doesn't matter as long as it responds with 404). I'll see  
if I can come up with a fix (possibly over the weekend) ...

Cheers,
Simon

Denis, please sent me the log directly - apparently it was stripped

Hmm.. this is strange - it works fine in the Terminal, in the GUI and  
in xterm. I suspect that this is some ESS-specific thing, but I have  
no idea what settings ESS changes. I couldn't find the error in R  
sources, either. Martin, do you have any idea where that error comes  
from?

Hi -

I compile R from sources because I want to use quartz graphics widows  
via Emacs/ESS. I compiled & installed 2.3.0 without any trouble on my  
G5 (10.4.6). When I tried the process on my PB G4 laptop (also  
10.4.6), R compiled as usual but on doing "sudo make install" I got  
the following error:

> make[1]: *** [R.1] Error 22
> make: *** [install] Error 1

I guess something is up with my configuration, but I don't know what.  
I have the latest version of xcode tools installed, and the  
configuration for compilation is as follows:

Any hints on what might have gone wrong in my setup are much  
appreciated.

Yup, exact same problem for me .. my config looked like:

R is now configured for powerpc-apple-darwin8.6.0

   Source directory:          .
   Installation directory:    /Library/Frameworks

   C compiler:                gcc  -g -O2 -std=gnu99
   Fortran 77 compiler:       gfortran  -g -O2

   C++ compiler:              g++  -g -O2
   Fortran 90/95 compiler:    f95

   Interfaces supported:      X11, aqua, tcltk
   External libraries:        readline, BLAS(generic), LAPACK(in blas)
   Additional capabilities:   JPEG, iconv, MBCS, NLS
   Options enabled:           framework, R profiling

   Recommended packages:      yes


And my system is an iBook G3 with OS 10.4.6.  I've compiled R several  
times without any problems until this version, so I'm not sure  
exactly what the issue is. Perhaps the problem is somewhere in:
./doc/Makefile.in:HELP2MAN = $(PERL) $(top_srcdir)/tools/help2man.pl

Message-ID: <E87E6251-07E2-4F24-86E8-A7F4E4FE568C@psp.ucl.ac.be>

Dear Mac -useRs,

I worked with R-2.2.1. I tried to install R-2.3.0 and R.GUI-1.15   
from a binary, available at CRAN, without removing the previous R- 
version. When double-clicking on the R.app icon, the R.GUI launched  
but tried unsuccessfully to start R. After few minutes, I need to  
force the R.GUI to stop. However, R-2.3.0 was successfully installed  
and easily started in the Terminal. What can I do ? Any idea would be  
helpful.

Matthieu

Is there a keyboard shortcut to select "Don't Save" from the panel
that R-GUI brings up in response to Apple-Q?  I prefer not to save
worksheets and I also prefer not to take my hands off the keyboard if
it is not necessary.  The only way I have been able to select the
"Don't Save" option from that panel is with the mouse.
