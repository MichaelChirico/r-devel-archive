Dear Colleague			Sunday

My husband died over a year ago.  Although I still use his e-mail address I would be grateful if you would remove this e-mail address from your mailing

I don't have any M3 machines so I can't check myself, unfortunately.

In cases like this, you could contact R-SIG-Mac-owner at r-project.org directly and also have them look for the email on the other r-project.org mailing lists.

Obviously, they would rather have users sort this out for themselves, since it requires manual intervention for the administrator, but this is an exceptional case.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] "R CMD build" ...Error... "processing vignette ...

 Pandoc is required to build R Markdown vignettes but not available."
Message-ID: <b8e66809-8a9f-4915-852d-d0eed514a23e@prodsyse.com>

Hello, All:


	  "R CMD build" fails for me, apparently because it cannot find pandoc, 
even though R in a command prompt finds it. This is with R 4.4.0 under 
macOS 14.5. I get the following in a Terminal:


___% R CMD build fda
* checking for file ?fda/DESCRIPTION? ... OK
* preparing ?fda?:
* checking DESCRIPTION meta-information ... OK
* installing the package to build vignettes
* creating vignettes ... ERROR
--- re-building ?BasisBasics.Rmd? using rmarkdown
Error: processing vignette 'BasisBasics.Rmd' failed with diagnostics:
Pandoc is required to build R Markdown vignettes but not available. 
Please make sure it is installed.


	  "Pandoc 3.2 already installed", per the following interaction with R 
in said Terminal:
	

 > library(pandoc)
 > pandoc_install()
? Fetching Pandoc releases info from github...
? Pandoc 3.2 already installed.
   Use 'force = TRUE' to overwrite.

Don't assume the system environment variables defined at the R command prompt are the same as the environment variables defined at the shell prompt. Various R startup scripts often alter these variables within R. It looks from my obscured position like the pandoc install directory is present in your PATH directory from the shell.

	  I do not find "pandoc" in this path.


	  What do you suggest I do to fix this?

You can add it, and things should be fine.  I'd put it last, just in 
case there's anything else in that directory that might interfere with 
other things.  So you could do

   PATH=$PATH:~/Library/Application\ Support/r-pandoc/3.2 R CMD build ...

(or if you want, the equivalent that makes the PATH change permanent).

Hi, Duncan, Jeff et al.:


	  Thanks for the help. Can I edit "R CMD" so it modifies the path? If 
yes, how? If that's not feasible, can I create a script of my own that 
would first change the path and then call "R CMD"?


	  I asked Apple how to modify the path and was told they do not support 
that.


	  Thanks,
	  Spencer Graves
