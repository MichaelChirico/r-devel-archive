Of course: see what its help says it does (and note what it says about 
where those symbols are, so you assigned to a different variable of 
that name).

It's not Mac-specific, it is an option() on all platforms.  E.g. 
?dev.new would have got you there.  See ?options and look for 
'device'.

Yes, some would.  E.g. quartz() will plot on the Mac screen, even 
when I've logged in from another machine -- only convenient if they 
are side-by-side (and something I have done whilst debugging the 
quartz() device).  There are also some odd font issues with quartz() 
that using X11() can circumvent.

Normally quartz() is the default if you use the R.app GUI, X11() 
otherwise *if* DISPLAY is set. And BTW, the choice of default is a lot 
more complicated than you make out: see src/library/grDevices/R/zzz.R 
.

I think this is a legacy of the time that a Mac terminal did not set 
DISPLAY, but now it does it is unclear whether the user wants to use 
it or not.

Last Nov I ran some 64bit stuff, no problem, and have not installed removed
any R or BioC stuff since then

Now I need to rerun and for several packages I get

package 'xxx' is not installed for 'arch=x86_64'

So I do

source ("http://www.bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite (c("xxx", "yyy", "zzz"), type="source")
And reload them

And then things work

My question: where how why did my 64bit stuff go?

Thank you

It's a bit difficult to comment about what sort of quasirandom event  
may have affected the integrity of your device, but here is a theory  
based on my experience: If you updated from binaries (32 bit) that  
were on the Bioconductor server, then you may have overwritten your  
compiled source 64 bit versions. It is rather easy to do that without  
noticing if you are using the GUI Installer. (The fix is also very  
easy.)

Thank you

I went down the R.app Package Manager list and clicked all the boxes and 6
of them gave the error message so on these I did the biocLite (c("xxx",
"yyy", "zzz"), type="source") drill
And all is Ok again

You might be right, I might have hit the binary buttons

Loren,
Following David's comment, it is hard to determine where/when the  
change occurred. The MacOS X leopard binary for the BioC 2.3 release  
of affyio does contain the x86_64 binary lib:

Patricks-MacBook-Pro-2:~ patrick$ curl -O  
http://bioconductor.org/packages/2.3/bioc/bin/macosx/leopard/contrib/2.8/affyio_1.10.1.tgz
   % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time      
Time  Current
                                  Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100  191k  100  191k    0     0   344k      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--  439k
Patricks-MacBook-Pro-2:~ patrick$ tar xfz affyio_1.10.1.tgz
Patricks-MacBook-Pro-2:~ patrick$ ls affyio/libs/x86_64/
affyio.so

One theory is that you installed the package from source while  
operating on the 32-bit architecture. If you do find a reproduce,  
please post your message to the Bioconductor mailing list since this  
is a packaging/distribution issue, rather than a R Mac OS X one.

Help!   I was running R code and started getting error messages that  
would not stop repeating.  I force-quit R, but when I attempted to run  
it again, it would not start (Icon kept bouncing until I force-quit  
again).  I restarted the computer, then I reinstalled R, but that did  
not fix the problem.  I deleted everything I could find related to R,  
and installed again.  Each time I install I get a "successful"  
message, but it does not start.  I don't know what to try next.

I have the latest versions of the operating system.

Thanks very much for your time.

Can you be a bit more specific about the error messages you were  
getting? (I guess if you can't even start R, it's not likely, but  
maybe you remember something about what the error was saying that kept  
repeating?)

Also, I'm not sure what version 3,1 means in your MBP description,  
which MBP are you runnning? (Though, I doubt it's a problem with the  
type of computer)

In the meantime:

* I think the only thing you need to delete in order to clean R out of  
your system is:

   * the /Library/Frameworks/R.framework directory
   * /Applications/R.app

   Is that what you cleaned?

* After cleaning and re-install (or now, even), can you run R from the  
terminal? Just open up Terminal.app and type "R" (no quotes).

Mary,
  A somewhat similar problem happened to me in January.
Following the advice of Byron Ellis , I removed the .Rhistory file

Yes, remove  .Rhistory and possibly also .RData and your .Rprofile

Some other things that might be relevant

the saved workspace ~/.Rdata
the saved history ~/.Rhistory
any personal library.

One piece of advice that often works is to start R with --vanilla 
(e.g. from a terminal 'R --vanilla'): if that works it indicates a 
problem in one of the startup files and with the help of ?Startup you 
can narrow the search down.

I hope that helps you here.

In order to do that, the OP may need to open a Terminal window,  
determine where the .Rhistory file resides, and issue the command  
'rm .Rhistory'. The Mac GUI hides a lot of the system innards  
including all the "." files.

Hello,

I am a beginner in R and I am having the error message:

> maqc <- read.xysfiles(xys.files)
Error in geometry(get(pkgname)) :
  no slot of name "geometry" for this object of class "platformDesign"

Could someone tell me what this means and how to correct it?

Here is my session history with the error message at the end.

Thanks a lot

Once toubleshooting a persistent problem with R,
to my embarrassment I found that my "clean install"
was not so clean--  the cause of my troubles lay in my .Rprofile
which I had forgotten about.

Can you be a bit more specific about the error messages you were
getting? (I guess if you can't even start R, it's not likely, but
maybe you remember something about what the error was saying that kept
repeating?)

Also, I'm not sure what version 3,1 means in your MBP description,
which MBP are you runnning? (Though, I doubt it's a problem with the
type of computer)

In the meantime:

* I think the only thing you need to delete in order to clean R out of
your system is:

   * the /Library/Frameworks/R.framework directory
   * /Applications/R.app

   Is that what you cleaned?

* After cleaning and re-install (or now, even), can you run R from the
terminal? Just open up Terminal.app and type "R" (no quotes).

It is considered extremely bad behavior to report something like this  
as bug (see recent post on R-devel).

Hi Osee,

I think your email will get lost in the mix because you:

(a) replied to an ongoing thread with a new/different question. Please  
just start a new thread by sending a fresh email to the group; and
(b) you're asking your question on the wrong group. Since you're  
having problems with a bioconductor package, repost your question  
there if you still can't figure out what's going on:

Yes it is a nuisance, but thankfully we seem to have solved the 
problem in the meantiime.

The one thing I at least have learnt is that a note somewhere about 
how to deal with this problem would be appropriate: perhaps in one of 
the FAQs.

Sorry .. I don't follow ... so, just out of curiosity, who reported  
anything as a bug?

I'm trying to help clear up what behavior, exactly,  should be avoided  
in the future.

Thanks,

See https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/2009-March/052359.html:
Mary Meyer did as PR#13565.

(I am about to reply about how I would like this to be handled: and as 
the person most likely to have to clear this up, what I would like is 
rather relevant.)

Ask on one list.  For beginners, only send a bug report if encouraged 
to do so by someome more experienced.  Unless you are sure it is not 
Mac-specific (or aboute Bioconductor), ask on R-sig-mac, not least 
because Mac-specific questions on R-help will get lost and those on 
R-devel might.

[Not just for Mary:]

Please only send bug reports for things you are *sure* are bugs: 
because > 90% of bug reports are erroneous and they do take up too 
much of R-core's time.  But the ones that get me angry are the serial 
offenders.

Also, please be patient: the experts are in short supply: Simon 
Urbanek is currently travelling, I will be next month ....

I tried to install the current version of rgl on R-forge from source  
from the 64 bit R-GUI and get this error during installation :

<entire listing copied below>
checking for X... no
configure: error: X11 not found but required, configure aborted.
ERROR: configuration failed for package 'rgl'
** Removing '/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/library/rgl'

The downloaded packages are in

I do have an X11 installation, XQuartz 2.3.1 (xorg-server 1.4.2- 
apple17), and wonder whether I need to do something to make X11's  
availability visible to the Installer? I believe that it loads under  
the 32 bit GUI although the version appears to be 0.82-2.

I am using the Apple version of X from Xcode, and building rgl works 
for me under an x86_64 build of R: it says

checking for X... libraries /usr/X11/lib, headers /usr/X11/include
checking for glEnd in -lGL... yes
checking for gluProject in -lGLU... yes
...

It's a while since I used XQuartz, but my recollection is that it 
used those locations.

rgl's configure uses the standard AC_PATH_X, which supports

X features:
   --x-includes=DIR    X include files are in DIR
   --x-libraries=DIR   X library files are in DIR

so that is how you specify the paths if you need to.

I used the command line to do this, as source package builds 
ultimately call command-line R as in

~/R/R64/bin/R CMD INSTALL rgl_0.83-751.tar.gz

It looks to me as if this is a path issue, as inside the R.app 
libpng-config is not found.  On my system it is in /usr/local/bin.
And I think the X configuration expects to find /usr/X11/bin/xmkmf 
(R's version certainly does).

So I suggests putting /usr/local/bin and /usr/X11/bin in your path.
(My CRAN build of R.app is showing /usr/local/bin but not 
/usr/X11/bin in its path.)

There are configure arguments and variables you can use to set all the 
pieces, but getting the right paths should be easier.

I think the problem in my case may be different, (and probably relates  
to my UNIX-challenged status) since:

david-winsemiuss-mac-pro:~ davidwinsemius$ $PATH
-bash: /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/texbin:/usr/ 
X11/bin: No such file or directory

I am not sure what the system is telling me, since there *is* a /usr/ 
X11/bin directory. Bear with me as I navigate to it from the root:

It tried to execute your PATH, and didn't find an executable with that 
name.  The usual way to show the PATH in Unix is "printenv PATH" or 
"echo $PATH".

But I don't know why rgl can't see your X11.

The error is because you need to do  "echo $PATH" or the like.  As to  
why rgl is failing, not certain of this, but looking at my path, I do  
not refer to the X11 directory directly  (oy that is bad sentence  
structure) instead have /usr/X11R6/bin  as in:

mendels% echo $PATH
/Applications/Absoft10/bin:/sw/bin:/sw/sbin:/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/ 
sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/texbin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/usr/local/ferret/bin

Give that a try.

David,

On my system libpng-config and xmkmf are in /usr/X11/bin, as on your  
system.
Adding /usr/X11/bin to my path did not help. I think /usr/X11R6 is  
just a link back to /usr/X11.

Did you try the terminal suggestion?

Download rgl_0.83-3.tar.gz from CRAN, then in a terminal

Robs-Intel:~ rob$ pwd
/Users/rob

Robs-Intel:~ rob$ cd Downloads/					# To wherever the rgl.....tar.gz  
got stored

Robs-Intel:Downloads rob$ ls
Cappuccino_Developer_Tools.pkg
Changes.app
Fluid_0.9.6.zip
iphone_sdk_for_iphone_os_2.2.19m2621afinal.dmg
rgl_0.83-3.tar.gz
...

Robs-Intel:Downloads rob$ R_ARCH=/x86_64 R CMD INSTALL  --configure- 
args='--disable-carbon' rgl_0.83-3.tar.gz
* Installing to library ?/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/ 
library?
* Installing *source* package ?rgl? ...
checking for gcc... gcc-4.2 -arch x86_64 -std=gnu99
checking for C compiler default output file name... a.out
checking whether the C compiler works... yes
checking whether we are cross compiling... no
...

I know, it is not the ultimate solution, but it might help to know  
this works on your system.

Rob

Tried that method:

The compilation proceeded without error and was reported:
<snip quite a bit of material attached as rgl-compile.log>
** building package indices ...
* DONE (rgl)


However, in R refreshing the Package Manager and attempting to load  
rgl fails to load with this error report:

Error in dyn.load(file, DLLpath = DLLpath, ...) :
   unable to load shared library '/Users/davidwinsemius/Library/R/2.8/

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Error loading packages, command 'tar' missing from path?
Message-ID: <1415006278.1139251236120733024.JavaMail.root@zm01.stanford.edu>

Hello all,

My appologies for any possible cross-posting--I originally posted a version of this to R-Help, but was refered to r-sig-mac because apparently my problem is mac-specific.

I'm running R2.8.1 on a Mac OS 10.4.11.  While trying to install the package gdata, I was presented with the following (error at end of report):

> install.packages("gdata")
also installing the dependency ?gtools?

Error in sprintf(gettext(fmt, domain = domain), ...) :
  argument is missing, with no default


It seems that 'tar' is missing which (I'm guessing) leads to an error in sprintf().  I've never been presented with this error before.  I tried loading various other packages and received the same error.  When the error first appeared, I was running R2.5.3.  After upgrading to R2.8.1 the error persists.

Thanks in advance for any help--
Andy Rominger

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Editor refresh problem
Message-ID: <52AA4A35-108F-449B-85D6-DF79F625D2D7@mac.com>

Hi all

I can't seem to find any mention of this topic in a google search, so  
I hope someone has solved this already.

I'm getting some refresh/redraw (not sure of the correct technical  
term) in the editor window for R app. I'm using  R 2.8.1 Gui 1.27  
Tiger build 32-bit(5301) on mac osx 10.5.6

When editing code it frequently looks like an entire line disappears  
(example Picture9.png there is a for loop missing), if I then move the  
corner drag tab everything refreshes and its all there (Example  
Picture10.png).

Does anyone know how to fix this?

David,

I did notice in your log.txt file the following message:

	ld warning: in /usr/local/lib/libfreetype.dylib, missing required  
architecture x86_64 in file

It seems a bit far fetched for the missing symbol to come from that  
library though (but this is a
JavaScripter/pythoneer talking :-).

As I normally work on R-2.9, I just went back to R-2.8.1 and tried the  
terminal procedure.
Got the rgl examples running without problems. So that is not the  
cause of the error message either.

I also noticed you are using the latest rgl from R-Forge (83-751),  
while I was using 83-3.
Both versions work on my system.

If someone could help out where _FT_Attach_File comes from ...

Rob

At one time I did attempt to install from that version, but I more  
recently followed your directions and installed from the CRAN 83-3  
version. When I go to the Package Manager dialog, the help file  
indicates that it is looking at rgl 83-3 (even if it won't load). On  
the other hand, the Package Installer still says I have 83-751.

Looking at the installation log I see this line in your installation:
Installing to library ?/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/ 
library?

I do not have that directory. I instead have
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/Libraries   ... and most of  
the package information is in
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/Versions/2.8/library

In that library I do find version 83-751

One  other change that has appeared is that the icons on the PM pages  
are now blue squares with "?" in them.

I don't know how to solve this but I always encounter this problem  
when I'm using the editor that's included in R.app.
Cheers,

I think it probably did -- the FT symbols are FreeType, used by rgl to 
draw nice fonts.

But I don't know how to fix this, other than configuring without 
Freetype (and so without nice fonts).

Regarding PATH and R.app. It is a well-known issue on OS X that R.app  
does not inherit the environment variables set in the shell (for  
example in ~/.profile or ~/.bashrc).

For example, it is complete standard that you get different output from
   # echo $PATH
and
   R> Sys.getenv("PATH")

The easiest way to fix this is to set the environment variable using  
the ~/.Rprofile and set it for example by
   Sys.setenv(PATH = "SOMETHING")
It can also be fixed by editing environment.plist (do a Google search  
for instructions).

And that is the problem.  Simon supplies a libfreetype.a that has

tystie% file /usr/local/lib/libfreetype.a
/usr/local/lib/libfreetype.a: Mach-O universal binary with 4 
architectures
/usr/local/lib/libfreetype.a (for architecture i386):	current ar 
archive random library
/usr/local/lib/libfreetype.a (for architecture ppc):	current ar

/usr/local/lib/libfreetype.a (for architecture x86_64):	current ar 
archive random library
/usr/local/lib/libfreetype.a (for architecture ppc64):	current ar 
archive random library

as part of devpack4-darwin8-bin4.tar.gz (on 
http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools/).

I don't have a libfreetype.dylib, and for anyone who wants to 
distribute packages you do want to link statically.  So if you move 
libfreetype.dylib out of the way (and have devpack4 installed), you 
should get a statically linked build and a loadable package.

I'm not going to try to track down the path issues further: if I add 
/usr/X11/bin to the path in R.app, rgl works for me.  So it must some 
aspect of the R.app environment for others.  For the record

	not found
Message-ID: <49AE8D53.5010100@tu-dresden.de>

Dear R-SIG-MAC developers,

I recently observed a NOTE on several MaxOS X package checks on CRAN:

sh: line 1: gs: command not found
!!! Error: Closing Ghostscript (exit status: 127)!
/usr/bin/texi2dvi: thumbpdf exited with bad status, quitting.


See for details:

http://www.r-project.org/nosvn/R.check/r-release-macosx-ix86/simecol-00check.html

or

http://www.r-project.org/nosvn/R.check/r-release-macosx-ix86/fxregime-00check.html


The check is related to vignette building, does anybody know what's 
wrong here?


Thanks a lot

Thomas Petzoldt

It is specific to your system - experience (see archives) shows that  
either you somehow changed the default PATH and it doesn't include / 
usr/bin anymore or you have somehow deleted tar (/usr/bin/tar).

I appreciate all the help. For me:

 > Sys.getenv("PATH")
                                           PATH
"/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin"

I suspect that I have in the past read that the system $PATH is not  
the correct place to let R know where libraries are located but I  
certainly had forgotten that important fact. I will re-read the  
Installation Manual and modify my .Rprofile accordingly.

I have loaded the devpack4 from Urbanek's website in the past and I do  
have what appears to be a similar version of libfreetype.a

/usr/local/lib/libfreetype.a: Mach-O universal binary with 4  
architectures
/usr/local/lib/libfreetype.a (for architecture i386):	current ar  
archive random library
/usr/local/lib/libfreetype.a (for architecture ppc):	current ar  
archive random library
/usr/local/lib/libfreetype.a (for architecture x86_64):	current ar  
archive random library
/usr/local/lib/libfreetype.a (for architecture ppc64):	current ar  
archive random library

Thank you all once more;

David,

I've created, as suggested by Casper and Brian, a .Rprofile in my home  
directory with a single line:

	Sys.setenv(PATH="/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/ 
X11/bin")

I think there needs to be a return after the line (could that have  
caused my problem earlier???).

This indeed fixes the install from within R.app!!!!!

Could it be that your system picks up another libfreetype.a. Does  
Spotlight show other libfreetype's?
Or good ol' find in the terminal:

Robs-Intel:~ rob$ sudo find /usr -name "libfreetype.*" -print
Password:
/usr/local/gtk2/lib/libfreetype.6.3.8.dylib
/usr/local/gtk2/lib/libfreetype.6.dylib
/usr/local/gtk2/lib/libfreetype.dylib
/usr/local/gtk2/lib/libfreetype.la
/usr/local/lib/libfreetype.a
/usr/local/lib/libfreetype.la
/usr/X11/lib/libfreetype.6.3.16.dylib
/usr/X11/lib/libfreetype.6.dylib
/usr/X11/lib/libfreetype.dylib
/usr/X11/lib/libfreetype.la
/usr/X11R6 1/lib/libfreetype.a
Robs-Intel:~ rob$

Just to make sure, I just reinstalled Simon's devpack4 and installed  
both versions of rgl (83-3 and 83-751). Both build, install and run  
fine from within R.app.

Rob

Thanks to all for your help and suggestions.  I apparently did somehow delete tar.  In the terminal i get:

$ which tar
no tar in /usr/bin /bin /usr/sbin /sbin /usr/local/bin /usr/X11R6/bin

Sorry to be a little slow, but I'm not familiar with working in the terminal so I'm sure there is a way to "reset" the path--but I don't know how to do it.  And I don't want to mess anything up any more!  Could anyone direct me as to where I can properly learn about resetting the path to include tar?

Thanks very much--
Andy

It is specific to your system - experience (see archives) shows that  
either you somehow changed the default PATH and it doesn't include / 
usr/bin anymore or you have somehow deleted tar (/usr/bin/tar).

To Simon: this was Mac-specific as only on Macs does install.packages 
use this piece of code (and we had a surplus comma in the gettextf 
call).

I've never used 10.4.11 and don't know if /usr/bin/tar is part of the 
base OS or of Xcode on that version.  I was hoping the Mac aficionados 
would know, my main reason for referring Andrew here.

My tar is in /usr/bin. According to your output, it is not present in  
that directory. As Kjell, I have Xcode install, but I am pretty sure  
tar is available on a standard (non-Xcode installed) Mac system -  
otherwise the binary distribution would have a bit of a problem.

My conclusion is that you somehow manage to delete tar from your  
system. How you did that I have no idea about. You could
  a) restore from backups (you do have backups, right)
  b) Install Xcode and see if it helps (I doubt that has anything to  
do with it, but it might restore stuff...)
  c) re-install your system
  d) install tar your self

d) is probably not too smart unless you really know what you are  
doing. If you have access to another machine with the same OS version  
you could try copy /usr/bin/tar. If you don't have backups...

tar is part of the base system, i.e. it is always installed on OS X  
(no Xcode needed). On the Tiger DVD it's in
/System/Installation/Packages/BaseSystem.pkg
so you can restore it from there.

.. to be more precise the tar itself is on the DVD in /usr/bin since  
the DVD is the base system ..

Hi,

If I run the following code under R.app 2.8.1 (from CRAN) and close the 
Quartz window *before* plotting finishes, it crashes every time.

OS is 10.5.6

Thanks,

I got a private message from Dr Azzalini this morning which I think  
was intended for the list

I have now been notified that my message below has not been delivered.
Try to send from another server. Hope this one works.

Thanks for the feedback and the suggestion. I have then downloaded
the most recent R version 2.8.1 from http://R.research.att.com/

R version 2.8.1 Patched (2009-02-26 r48012)
i386-apple-darwin8.11.1

but the problem with ask() is still there..

R>  ask('x')
x: c(1, 3,4)

*** caught segfault ***
address 0x4628d484, cause 'memory not mapped'

In one case, I got instead, withou crash

Error in parse(prompt = paste(message, ": ", sep = "")) :
  'getEncChar' must be called on a CHARSXP

Thanks again fro your advice.

Best wishes,

Adelchi Azzalini

I previously could not confirm that the code was misbehaving. but I  
now can with on a R version that I installed yesterday with input  
through the 64 bit GUI. I do notice that the one time that Dr Azzalini  
got an error instead of a crash, the offending call appears similar to  
that listed as the most proximate Traceback.

  *** caught segfault ***

Traceback:
  1: parse(prompt = paste(message, ": ", sep = ""))
  2: eval(parse(prompt = paste(message, ": ", sep = "")))
  3: ask("input")

Hi, all,

Uwe Ligges has a nice tool for creating R binaries for Windows.

http://win-builder.r-project.org/

Is there an equivalent for Mac to create the tgz file?

Thanks,

Not directly. Both R-Forge.r-project.org and rforge.net create Mac  
binaries for hosted projects and we do build Mac binaries for CRAN  
packages, but not from arbitrary sources.

I'm more concerned about abuse than Uwe, we don't have a spare  
dedicated machine for this and I don't want to deal with securing a  
machine to build packages in a sandbox. However, if there was a high- 
enough demand (nothing indicated that so far), we may think about it ...

Cheers,
Simon

It is currently tricky: packages built on MacOS by you or I under 
2.8.1 are likely to depend on things in /usr/local, and there are OS 
differences (Tiger vs Leopard) and the Mac binaries are tied to 2.x.* 
for one x (unlike the Windows ones).  Simon tells me he has now fixed 
some of the issues, so hopefully this will be possible in future.

It is I am told possible to use R-forge to do this (but I have two 
Macs amongst my menagerie, so I don't need to find out).

But winbuilder is a great initiative from Uwe (with some help from his 
friends), so all credit to him.  Stefano's original Mac package 
building service was based on Uwe's work too (same rider applies).

Thanks for the replies from both Simon and Brian.

Brian, I have one clarification question about your comment below. You
say,  "Mac binaries are tied to 2.x.* for one x...." Does this mean
that if I build a Mac binary using R-2.8.*, then someone using 2.7.*
would not be able to install and/or load it?

Thanks,

--sundar

Correct (if it contains compiled code).  E.g. I have

tystie% otool -L tree/libs/tree.so
ree/libs/i386/tree.so:
 	tree.so (compatibility version 0.0.0, current version 0.0.0)
 	/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.8/Resources/lib/libR.dylib 
(compatibility version 2.8.0, current version 2.8.0)

and so it needs at least 2.8.0.

There are lots of other differences: only the Leopard builds have the 
64-bit architectures, for example.

I've tended to just install my own packages from sources: that way 
always works for me.

I think installing a Windows binary package on Mac (or any other  
operating system) is probably not officially supported - so the  
package manager is not going to be too helpful here. In this case  
you're lucky though - WiSP does not contain any native code.  All you  
need to do is unpack the wisp_1.2.6.zip archive (which OS X is  
apparently doing for you already) and put the wisp folder in your R  
library using the Finder. Worked for me anyway. Also, you should  
probably email the package authors and ask them to provide a source  
version of the package as well.

HTH,

Worked for me as well. To find your library directory, just open R and
type ".libPaths()". For me, it's

> .libPaths()
[1] "/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/library"

As Kjell noted, I just unzipped the binary in the latter directory.
Then library(wisp) worked just fine.

Hi!

The wisp package doesn?t contain source code that has to be complied
for a specific platform. There is no src directory in the package.
It just consist of native R code. Installation in this case is  
straight forward.

Unzip the file on the desktop and invoke the following line in terminal:

R CMD INSTALL ~/Desktop/wisp/ -l ~/Library/R/2.8/library

the -l flag specifies your user library. Note, installing in a user
directory is the recommend way. Otherwise the package is installed
into /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/library, the default
library path.

Message-ID: <0E84A0F1-4664-4981-AA5D-1C4BA194BCE5@ed.ac.uk>

Hi All,

This is a slightly arcane question, but I'm wondering if anyone else  
uses vi mode with R? On my platform, across several versions, there is  
some broken behaviour. When executing commands like 'df)' (to delete  
up to the next bracket) the cursor moves to the next ), but nothing is  
deleted. In general, many delete/replace commands work only as movement.

Has anyone else come across this, and if so, did you find a fix?

The same commands work correctly on the command line, so I'm assuming  
the R CLI has it's own built in version of readline, which is causing  
problems.

I'm currently running R2.8.1 on OSX 10.5.6, but the bug has been there  
for both R and OSX upgrades. It isn't present on Linux.

Cheers,
dave

Or your assumption that it is GNU readline is causing you problems.

The editing library on OS X is not GNU readline.  By 'on the command 
line' I guess you mean in bash, which does include GNU readline. 
(Earlier versions of OS X did not use bash.)

If you want GNU readline, the solution it to build R to use it.  This 
is described in the R for Mac OS X FA!, section 2.1.3.

BTW, it is common policy on help lists not to answer questions about 
topics in the FAQ, and the R posting guide asked you to check that 
first. Especially when asked on the wrong list:

See ?options, look at 'device'.

This is getting to be an FAQ ....

ObjectiveC uses the same ABI as C (it's in fact just a very thin layer  
above C), so you can safely use R's C API. In addition, if you want to  
instantiate ObjC objects and pass messages (without going through  
function calls), you can use one of the ObjC packages around: Cocoa (http://www.rforge.net/Cocoa/ 
  ) or RObjectiveC (http://www.omegahat.org/RObjectiveC/ ).

All of the above assumes that you want to use that tool as a library  
(R supports ObjC in packages out of the box). If you want to just  
invoke it on the command line, you can use the regular system()  
interface.

The easiest way for you, is to put your Sys.setenv command inside a  
file called .Rprofile, locate in the root of your home directory, ie.  
~/.Rprofile

Commands in this file gets run when you start R.

Message-ID: <8a4b2cfa0903130652k34962b90v90cd7d9893ca9709@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Mac R users/developers,

Do you have any tips on how to export graphical outputs in R on a Mac
as line drawings, which can be further processed in e.g. Adobe
illustrator or Keynote / Powerpoint?
It seems that Quartz only outputs pdf and grid structured images,
whereas in R Windows, it is possible to copy a graphical output from
the R graphics device as a metafile.

Thanks,

Olivier

PDF supports both vector graphics and bitmaps and is superior to  
Windows metafiles. Both AI and Keynote can deal with PDF files very  
well (the former can even edit individual objects in it).

You can "print" the Quartz window to the Preview program using the  
Preview button in the print dialog. Choosing File/ "Save As.."  will  
let you access 12 format options by clicking the Format button/ 
parameter.

Thanks Kasper and Prof. Brian. Using Sys.setenv in ~/.Rprofile fixed it.

I found two such papers with different Figure number 1's

http://polmeth.wustl.edu/retrieve.php?id=311

This is really a simulation problem if my cursory reading is correct.

And if point of fact, King and his group after offering the Crarify  
package in Statta have more recently incorporated that method into  
mlogit within their Zelig offering, which is an R package:

Hi Simon, all,

thanks for these answers. I did not realize that I could edit pdf
vector graphics by opening the pdf in Illustrator.
I used to simply paste wmf vector graphics into Powerpoint and then
"ungroup" and edit further in Powerpoint. Although Illustrator gives
the option to export as wmf, in my version this is faulty, and so I
have to finalize the graphic in Illustrator, because I cannot import
the graphic as vector into Powerpoint / Keynote. Would you know how
else (other than Illustrator) to edit vector graphics from Quartz
output? (All other save-options are raster-based).

Cheers,

Olivier

Olivier-

In my experince AI is a perfect tool to edit/stylise
R ouput. Inkscape is an opensource tool supporting
advanced vector editing.

I would not recommend converting to wmf, it often behaves
unpredictable (fontsizes, font embedding, linewidths, ?)!
R creates very consistent pdf and postscript output. To my
experience the best ones I know of! Especially in terms of post
editing. Don't "destroy" it by squeezing it into wmf (emf).

AI will by default embend fonts when saved by the application.
Try to solve warnings about Zapf Dingbats font, if they appear!
For example embed AdobePiStd font.

Note, powerpoint will render pdf files on import. Often graphical
quality is remarkable reduced. A better way is to import a png file.
You can create png from preview.app or AI.

Keynote will not rip pdf to screen resolution and keeps figures
as they come .

Have fun!

Roland

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] qqline plots outside plot area
Message-ID: <083A0C62-5967-4F02-9DBE-9812ED684AA8@comcast.net>

I just executed the example in the R graph gallery for qqplot and it  
includes a call to qqline. It plots the line beyond the plotting  
region, unlike the illustration and unlike the behavior of any of the  
other "line" functions in my (limited) experience. the example on the  
help page for qqplot/qqline does the same. It does not appear that I  
have masked qqline with another package version.

y <- rt(200, df = 5)
qqnorm(y); qqline(y, col = 2)

And it now works fine for me as well. When I was running some of the  
graphics examples in the thread yesterday on recreating a JMP graphic,  
I noticed that the behavior had persisted in other plots, but that it  
later reverted to normal clipping behavior. Today rerunning that code  
does not reproduce the problem. I have revisited the webpage ;
http://addictedtor.free.fr/graphiques/RGraphGallery.php?graph=127
  ... and repasted the code and the off-graph plotting does not return.

Oh my - the quality of the graphs on that website is horrible ... it's  
quite embarrassing that people create such horrible output despite the  
fact that R has much better graphics devices ...

To be honest I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about. I  
was not talking about any packages or hidden features at all. Almost  
all default graphics device (quartz on Mac OS X and X11 on all other  
unices) as well as bitmap graphics output (png, jpeg, ...) are now  
producing very nice output and Brian Ripley has spent quite some time  
recently making all devices as consistent as possible and adding cairo  
backend to be default in R to produce good output and support modern  
drawing features. In addition, there are better formats such as PDF to  
consider which also work very well. Hence I don't see why we should  
put up with font rendering reminiscent of the time of 8 color displays  
many decades ago.

In addition we are on SIG-Mac here, and you have to work really,  
really hard to get such horrible output on a Mac ;)

Cheers,
Simon

The following code runs fine on Linux, but not on my Mac.  The error
message is given below, after the levelplot() call.  I was able to run
lattice functions previously on the Mac without any problems.  I don't
know what has changed.  I searched R-help and found a similar problem
that wasn't answered.  My Mac is running Xcode 2.5, in case that is
relevant.

I found a font cache cleaning program online, Font Finagler 1.0, and
installed it as root.  The Font Finagler program is free for 40 font
cleanings, after which it costs $11.  I ran this as root, including all
the different types of font caches in the inspection and cleaning.  On
my first try after rebooting the Mac I still had the same problem, but
then a short time later the problem disappeared, so maybe the font
cleaning was key.  

Thank you for suggesting flushing the font cache as a possible solution.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] cblas on Mac and Linux
Message-ID: <49C320A4.1000500@csse.unimelb.edu.au>

Hi,

I've got a package with some C code calling cblas functions (e.g., 
cblas_dgemm). The code is called using .C() . In order to compile 
correctly either cblas.h on Linux or Accelerate.h on a Mac:

#include <R.h>
#ifdef MACOSX
#include <Accelerate/Accelerate.h>
#else
#include <cblas.h>
#endif

Of course, this doesn't work well with the standard Makevars 
PKG_LIBS=$(LAPACK_LIBS) $(BLAS_LIBS) $(FLIBS) since I need to set the 
-DMACOSX flag for each platform.

Do I need to create another makefile to decide which OS the code is 
running on, or is there an easier way of doing this?

Thanks,
Gad

You use configure -- see 'Wrtiing R Extensions' --  to fill in a 
Makevars.in.  But beware that in general $(BLAS_LIBS does not contain 
a cblas, even on MacOS X, so if portability is any sort of issue, you 
need to set PKG_LIBS via configure too.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] R GUI Cannot load Interface Builder
Message-ID: <AF0689FE-8C8C-4C00-B08B-7BE5BC80E8D6@sbg.ac.at>

Hi!

I'm using the R GUI with joy ever since, despite some occasional
misbehaviour. However, the last days I have noticed some errors
that really waste a considerable amount of time.

I'm sorry, I can't come up with a reproducible example,
but I try to explain how the error was raised in my case.

During testing of code I subsequently executed
lines by cmd + return.

After several times suddenly the working directory
in the GUI shows <deleted> instead of the path.
Maybe I did some strange key combination here,
but in the past I did never deleted the path by accident?

The console then states:

2009-03-20 10:06:08.537 R[620] Cannot load Interface Builder file '/ 
System/Library/Frameworks/AppKit.framework/Resources/German.lproj/ 
NSAlertPanel.nib'

I am not able to save any open files, but can copy
and paste to TextEdit to prevent loss.

Funny to see what sessionInfo() tells invoked after.

Any Ideas what will cause that crash?

Well, the error seems clear: your R session has too many files open. 
Now most OSes do have limited tables of files per process, but the 
numbers are not small: on Mac OS I believe it is 256 (that's what bash 
reports on mine): 1024 is a common value for other Unixen.

You could try closeAllConnections(), in case that helps enough to let 
you shutdown the session (but R allows only 128 connections, so that 
is not the main cause here).

Have you any idea what you might be doing that opens hundreds of 
files (at a lower level than R).  Are you actually using those spatial 
packages (it might be one of those)?

It is possible to raise the limit on the number of open files (in 
bash, ulimit -n), but this is not advisable unless you need it.

Thanks for the hint!

Your guess is absolutely right! Inside a function there
are calls to readGDAL and readOGR (package rgdal).
I did put closeAllConnections() inside that function.
Hopefully that will solve the problem. If not, I will ask
the R-Sig-Geo list about that issue.

I apologise, R GUI is not causing that problem!

Please check your .libPaths() that you don't have multiple versions of  
those packages around - possibly from an older version of R.

I would probably recommend that - given that both messages read the  
same. You can also try to see what's really breaking (e.g. via  
options(error=recover)) and why. Also trying a different mirror can  
often help if the mirror is broken. Finally, if you want us to be of  
more substantial help, please don't forget to post sessionInfo() as we  
kindly ask you and in this case .libPaths() as well.

Cheers,
Simon

There are Apple specific defines in GCC. As far as I know
__APPLE__
means compiling on Apple hardware, whereas
__APPLE_CC__
means compiling using an Apple supplied compiler.

However, the first one seems sometimes to be used when the last one is  
intended.

Note, however, that as Brian suggested neither of the above helps with  
the case under consideration if it is to be portable. Although  
Accelerate can be assumed on (recent) OS X, it doesn't mean that it's  
what R uses or the user wants. In fact BLAS headers are not always  
available, so in most cases the problem listed here is not an issue at  
all since the functions used can be simply declared. The real issue is  
linking against the correct library and R provides no way to do that  
automatically since it doesn't use cblas, so the only reliable way is  
what Brian described.

Cheers,
Simon

Really belongs o R-SIG-Mac list and have copied it there. I cannot  
reproduce on my Mac. I get the same colors on the pdf file with that  
code as I do on the screen device. I have in in the past needed to set  
up a device before plotting:
trellis.device(device="postscript", color = TRUE)  ... but you are not  
using a trellis function or creating postscript.

What does  utils::str(pdf.options()) return?
On mine I get this
List of 15
  $ width      : num 7
  $ height     : num 7
  $ onefile    : logi TRUE
  $ family     : chr "Helvetica"
  $ title      : chr "R Graphics Output"
  $ fonts      : NULL
  $ version    : chr "1.4"
  $ paper      : chr "special"
  $ encoding   : chr "default"
  $ bg         : chr "transparent"
  $ fg         : chr "black"
  $ pointsize  : num 12
  $ pagecentre : logi TRUE
  $ colormodel : chr "rgb"
  $ useDingbats: logi TRUE


Perhaps this could be a cure?:
  pdf.options(colormodel = "rgb")

You probably ought to update as well before raising the bug-flag.

Have you tried viewing the pdf file in another viewer, e.g. Acrobat? 
Preview in MacOS 10.4 had a number of bugs in it; there are fewer in 
10.5, I think.

Dear Simon and other Mac Gui developers,

I have been testing the psych package for 2.9.0 and have found an 
unrelated  problem with the GUI when it is interacting with Rgraphviz.

If I run R.app directly from the X11 window, I can load and run 
Rgraphviz with no problem.

But, when I try loading the Rgraphviz package by
>  library(Rgraphviz)  , the Gui crashes;

Thanks again for the wonderful GUI.  My students who use PCs are very jealous.

What do you mean by "running R.app directly from the X11 window"?

We would also like to get some details on what version of Rgraphviz  
you are using as well as what version of Graphviz you are using and  
how you installed the two versions? graphvizVersion() might be useful.  
It might also be useful to update to the latest version of Rgraphviz  
in the devel branch of Bioconductor, it has version 1.21.9 and install  
it from source.

My naming mistake.  I was running R itself from the X11 window.

[1] "2.20.3"

I installed it by hand.  Copying it over from the 
R2.8.1 library into the 2.9.0 (alpha) library.
I did that because  the R Gui that I downloaded 
yesterday (and again this morning) does not seem 
to allow me to use the package installer or 
manager)
(error message:
Error: could not find function "browse.pkgs"
Error: could not find function "package.manager"


For R in X11 the sessionInfo shows

That won't work. The paths to libR are entirely different - you have  
to re-compile between R 2.8.x and R 2.9.x.

That is fine.  However, I have the other problem 
(not related to the Rgraphviz problem) that I can 
not download packages because of the installer 
and package manager error.

Me culpa - those entry points have been removed, so the GUI needs  
updating. Will fix and keep you posted. Thanks for reporting,

Dear DHines,

It looks to me as if there's some problem with your X11 installation. What
happens if you try to start X11 independently of R -- e.g., by entering
xterm in a (bash) terminal? I'm copying this response to Rob Goedman since
he's much more knowledgeable about these matters than I am.

I hope this helps,
 John

Now, everything works like a charm (again).

As I am sure you know, there is still a problem with installing from 
the Packages and Data menu:

Error: could not find function "package.manager"
Error: could not find function "browse.pkgs"

Hi Marije,

Personally, I would be more concerned with memory than processor.
Running out of memory can be an unpleasant surprise. Base R uses a
single core, but Simon Urbanek's multicore package (the most recent
version of which, 0.1-3, is dated today) does allow you to use multiple
cores at once. I haven't used this package, so can't offer any personal
experience.

I agree with Dan, memory will often be the limiting
factor.  I added RAM (16GB total) to my ppc and have
had a much more productive environment, both for
32 bit and 64 bit applications.

Even if a single R session cannot benefit from multiple
cores, if you can break your processes into parallel
pieces you can use your separate CPUs with cluster
software, or just run multiple R jobs manually.

I'd recommend maximizing your RAM quantity over
RAM speed.  Also, determine the speed gain.
Speed gains of 10-fold or more are noticeable,
speed gains of 2 to 3 fold rarely make much of a 
difference.

Hi Marije,

Personally, I would be more concerned with memory than processor.
Running out of memory can be an unpleasant surprise. Base R uses a
single core, but Simon Urbanek's multicore package (the most recent
version of which, 0.1-3, is dated today) does allow you to use multiple
cores at once. I haven't used this package, so can't offer any personal
experience.

I don't use BioC [you may want to ask on the BioC list instead (or  
hopefully some BioC users will chip in)], so my recommendations may be  
based on slightly different problems.

Unfortunately I cannot comment on Nehalems, but in general with Xeons  
you do feel quite a difference in the clock speed, so I wouldn't trade  
2.93GHz for 2.26GHz regardless of the CPU generation. It is true that  
pre-Nehalem Mac Pros cannot feed 8 cores, so you want go for the new  
Mac Pros, but I wouldn't even think about the 2.26GHz option. Some  
benchmarks suggest that the 2.26 Nehalem can still compete favorably  
if a lot of memory/io is involved, but it was not very convincing and  
I cannot tell first hand.

R can use multiple cores in many ways - through BLAS (default in R for  
Mac OS X), vector op parallelization (Luke's pnmath) or explicit  
parallelization such as forking (multicore) or parallel processes  
(snow). The amount of parallelization achievable depends heavily on  
your applications. I use routinely all cores, but then I'm usually  
modeling my problems that way.

I cannot comment on ongoing work details due to DNA associated with  
Snow Leopard, but technically from the Apple announcements you can  
deduce that the only possible improvements directly related to R can  
be achieved in the implicit parallelization which is essentially the  
pnmath path. There is not much more you can do in R save for a re- 
write of the methods you want to deal with.

In fact, the hope is rather that the packages for R start using  
parallelization more effectively, but that's not something Snow  
Leopard alone can change.

In my line of work (which is not bioinf, though) RAM turned to be more  
important, because the drop off when you run out of memory is sudden  
and devastatingly huge. With CPUs you'll have to wait a bit longer,  
but the difference is directly proportional to the CPU speed you get,  
so it is never as bad as running out of wired RAM. (BTW: in general  
you don't want to buy RAM from Apple - as much as I like Apple, there  
are compatible RAM sets at a fraction of the cost of what Apple  
charges, especially for Mac Pros - but there is always the 1st  
generation issue *).

6GB is very little RAM, so I don't think that's an option ;) - but  
yes, you should care about the size first. The channels and timings  
only define how you populate the slots. Note that the 4-core Nehalem  
has only 4 slots, so it's not very expandable - I'd definitely get a 8- 
core old one with 16GB RAM or more rather than something that can take  
only 8GB ...

I would keep an eye on the RAM expansibility - even if you buy less  
RAM now, a ceiling of 8GB is very low. It may turn out that larger  
DIMMs will become available, but 16GB for the future is not enough,  
either. As with all 1st generation products the prices will go down a  
lot over time, so you may plan to upgrade later. Another piece worth  
considering is that you can always update RAM easily, but CPU upgrade  
is much more difficult.

Cheers,
Simon

Message-ID: <C569FA38-1D74-4141-8351-2B71E928198F@me.com>


R for MAC experts:

When using the current version of R for MAC, I notice a troublesome  
behavior.  Sometimes I need to build complex regression models  
(usually using lmer) or simulations that take 10 minutes or more for  
the computer to compute.  While this computing is going on, I would  
like to be able to take advantage of this "free time" to write more  
code.  But I can't! In my current setup of R for MACs the script  
editor is frozen while the console is computing. That means that my  
only recourse is to go for a 10 minute coffee or to the toilet.  I  
don't believe that my windows version of R has this same problem.

My question:  Is there a way to set R for MAC up so that the script  
editor window is functional while the console window in chomping away  
at some calculations?

Simon,

We've some experience with recent Xeons on Linux serrers, and that 
says that the size of the L1 cache is at least as important as clock 
speed.  The following figures are from memory and rounded ....  A dual 
quad-core 2.5GHz 12Mb cache system (we've an identical pair, one my 
server, bought in January) outperforms a dual quad-core 3CHz 6Mb cache 
system bought 9 months earlier.  That's running R, and in particular 
multiple R jobs.  At least here, the extra cost of the 2.93GHz 
processor is phenomenal.

Also, it looks to us like the Achilles' Heel of the Mac Pro is its 
disk system.  Even if you load it up with a RAID controller and extra 
discs (pretty exorbitant, too) it is still on paper way down on my 
server -- and the 3GHz server does considerably outperform mine on 
disc I/O as it has more discs and a better RAID controller, and our 
Solaris servers are better still.

Just a bit of background,

Brian

Dear list,

calling `help(topic)' always displays in the help system of R.app,  
even if `help.start(browser="/Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/

`help()' should display in the browser specified in `help.start()'.  
Am I wrong? Is there a possibility to make `help()' display in the  
browser? I would prefer this because I like to use functionality such  
as tabbed browsing and "search as you type".
Here's what "About R" says in my case:
R 2.8.1 GUI 1.27 Tiger build 32-bit (5301)

Thanks in advance!

The current GUI is running in the same event loop as R in order to  
allow R to use UI elements directly. This implies that if some C code  
in R hogs the CPU without allowing UI events to be processed, it will  
block the whole UI including the editor. "Good" packages won't do that  
since R provides R_CheckUserInterrupt() call to prevent this from  
happening, but apparently some still do.

Although there is a draft of a GUI that runs R on a separate thread  
from the GUI, but it opens up a whole can of worms since all access to  
system libraries needs to be scheduled on the main thread. Since R has  
no provision for that, it would make it likely that packages will  
violate this rule thus making R unstable, especially since it's OS- 
specific. Unfortunately UIs on OS X have to run on the main thread, so  
we cannot run R on the main thread and the GUI on a separate thread.  
Therefore the best we can currently do is to rely on packages to check  
events during long computations in C code. Note that this is not an  
issue in pure R code because R makes sure the check are done.

Cheers,
Simon

there is no Mac OS binary of rgdal on CRAN?

William Kyngesburye has up to date binaries
