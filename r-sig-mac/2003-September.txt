Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Saving graphs from x11
Message-ID: <2E3EA1CB-E7E9-11D7-8006-000393C940DE@mac.com>

I'm running R through xemacs. I'm wanting to save my output graphs. 
I've found several things that talk about saving the output, but I'm 
using a pre-written taxometrics program that generates the code for me. 
Is there a way I can get the graphical output saved?

thanks,
-Sammy

You should be able to do

pdf("outputgraphs.pdf")
..run your program..
dev.off()

This will send all graphics output to the pdf file rather than to the
screen.

Thanks. It doesn't seem to work, though. Output is still being sent to 
the display instead of to the file. The file is being created, but 
there's nothing in it. I'm having the same problem when using RAqua 
(since it seems to use the x11 display for graphical output). Would you 
mind looking at the program to see if there's something else you can 
see? I'll attach it in an email if you would like. Thanks for your help

One possible explanation is that the program contains a call to 
x11(). Does a new x11 display window open up each time you run the 
program? I'd be willing to look at the program for you (hopefully it 
isn't too long).

Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.43L0.0309240734080.8502-100000@snow>

Hi All -- This is not really an R question, but has to do with the g77
(and gcc) compilers.

I am running OS-X 10.2 and am using g77 from the december 2002 developers'
tools (from apple), with the most recent gcc 3.3 compiler update (august,
2003).  i have a set fortran programs which i compile using g77.
compiling goes fine, but when i run the program it crashes (segmentation
fault).

the same progam compiles and runs fine on a sun machine running solaris.
the only difference with the sun machine compile is that it uses gcc
2.95.2.  however, when i try to compile on my mac with gcc 2.95.2, i get
the following:

% g77 -V 2.95.2 dmattool.f darraytool.f linpack.f
g77: installation problem, cannot exec `f771': No such file or directory
g77: installation problem, cannot exec `f771': No such file or directory
g77: installation problem, cannot exec `f771': No such file or directory


I doubt the problem is with the new gcc (versus 2.95), but I thought I
would rule that out.  Anyway, I am now stuck, so any suggestions would be
helpful.

Correction:  I am using g77 v. 3.1 from fink, with the most recent gcc
compiler update from apple.

you should do
R CMD INSTALL package.tgz

from the shell (Terminal Application)

and R should be in the PATH of your system.

g77 has never been shipped from Apple.

The latest DEv Tools (December + August 2003 update) have gcc 3.3
You should use g77 for gcc 3.3 (which is g77 v3.4).
You can find a copy reading the web page
