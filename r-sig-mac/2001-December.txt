Probably simple for you
Previously you wrote
src/macintosh/ReadMe.MPW in R-devel archive (Aug_22_2001 or later).
But where is this R-devel archive? (an ftp archive, or a CVS?)
I never found this

I searched
http://developer.r-project.org/
rsync on http://cran.r-project.org/
http://rsync.r-project.org/
http://cran.r-project.org/
ftp://cran.r-project.org/pub/R/src
ftp://ftp.stat.math.ethz.ch/Software/R
ftp://cran.r-project.org/pub/R/sources.html
(http://cran.it.r-project.org/	 does not exist)

in searches I end up most of the time with some site for the binaries
http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macos/
http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/


I find also source of 1.3.1
http://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-1.3.1.tgz

before I search longer I better ask.

you can find it on CRAN (any mirror) into the Source page, i.e.

http://cran.r-project.org/sources.html

there you find the link to the .tgz devel, patched etc archives

ftp://ftp.stat.math.ethz.ch/Software/R

and inside this you have daily snapshots of thr R-devel source tree.

Hope this helps

R 1.4.0 is now sinking into feature freeze, and I'd like some help
testing it under Macintosh (from Sys 8.6 to X).


I've put a copy of R140b1 at

there are two files: R140b1.sit and R140b1.sit.hqx

download only one of the two.

Many tests have been done but you help will be precious. Several things 
have been changed or implemented both in R internals and Mac GUI.

Problem reports to stefano.iacus@unimi.it or to r-sig-
mac@stat.math.ethz.ch, please.  (At this stage the features are frozen, 
so no feature requests ....)

thanks

Minor issues:
It seems that the formula display has improved a lot. The demo for 
plotmath() still shows some glimpses. (But I do not htink one should 
spend to much time on this. Better convince someone to provide a 
proper quartz driver).

Very minor issues:

Hi all,

I recently updated my system from Mac OS 9.1 to OS X (Version 10.1).
How can I use my currently invisible .RData files (created with R 1.3.1) 
on the new system?
Is there a way to make these files visible/readable on Mac OS X?

Sorry for this OS X beginner question...
Any advice is welcome!

You can see "invisible" files from the term window using commands like 
"ll"

which version of R for mac are you using ? (Carbon or Darwin)

I use the Carbon version of R.
Is there any problem with renaming the .RData file e.g. in RData? And is 
there any application on OS X like 'creator type convertor' to make the 
RData file doubleclickable?
Anyway, loading the workspace file .RData via menu works fine!

You can rename it as you please, but naming it as .RData and putting it=20=

in the same folder as R binary is, will cause R to load that image file=20=

by default at startup.

You can double click on the file and OS X should pop up a dialog asking=20=

I hope this helps you.

In 10.1 in the Get Info dialog you can associate filename suffixes 
with applications.
This might work for double-clicking .Rdata. Of course, that only 
works if you can get the Finder to show it in the first place!

There probably are some shareware or freeware appliations that will 
cause files whose names begin with "." to be shown in the Finder. 
Browse http://www.versiontracker.com/macosx/index.shtml. I thought 
there was a System or Finder preference for this, but I couldn't find 
it.

If you want to install R on Darwin you must do a number of other things. 
Not all
of it is necessary, but most of it will make your life easier (after a 
while), and it
will make your R faster. Of course you may decide to wait on R-1.4.0.

a. Install Fink from fink.sourceforge.net. Use Fink to install libz, 
libreadline,
atlas, libjpeg, libpng, f2c, dlcompat, tcl/tk, and maybe f77/g77. Make 
sure you source
the init.csh file that comes with Fink. This sets /sw/bin at the 
beginning
of your path and it sets DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH. You could also install all 
of Gnome
from Fink (if you want to use --gui=gnome in R).

b. Become an Apple developer (for free) and download and install the 
Apple
developer tools. Go to www.apple.com/developer or connect.apple.com

c. Download the latest version of R-1.3.1 from 
gifi.stat.ucla.edu/R/builds
and install in /usr/local

d. See if it works. If it complains about missing libraries, try

otool -L /usr/local/lib/R/bin/R.bin

and see what it wants. Provide the missing stuff from either Fink or
gifi.stat.ucla.edu/R/dylibs. In the same may you can use otool -L to see
what the tcl/tk or gnome modules are looking for, and the various
precompiled packages.

You can find it in the usual two forms (full or base+recommended)

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac]R-1.4.0 for MacOS X
Message-ID: <385A0FB0-F6A1-11D5-BA85-00039364CC92@stat.ucla.edu>

Get it from ftp://gifi.stat.ucla.edu in pub.

This contains the base files plus the recommended packages (except rpart,
which does not compile yet).

It is compiled under MacOS X 10.1.2 with the December 2001 version of
the Developer Tools, and with g77 from fink.sourceforge net. It has 
support
for gnome, X11R6, and tcl/tk, and it uses the newest ATLAS from fink. It
has two-level namespaces and has a libR.dylib included.

For R,bin you need on your system (remember to set DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH,
or --better-- install fink and compile these things yourself)

        /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current 
version 55.0.0)
         /sw/lib/libz.1.dylib (compatibility version 1.1.3, current

         /sw/lib/libncurses.dylib.5 (compatibility version 5.0.0, current

         /sw/lib/libtk8.3.dylib (compatibility version 8.0.0, current

Everything in /usr/X11R6 comes from Xfree86 (Xtools would also be OK), 
everything
in /sw/lib comes from fink.

Message-ID: <FDE68498-F6CC-11D5-888F-003065CC4CB8@unimi.it>

I have just uplodaed on CRAN both versions of R 1.4.0.

So starting from Dec 23rd, you'll find the builds for Carbon and Darwin 
directly on CRAN respectively at

http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macos	:	Carbon R (8.6 -> 9.2 and OSX)
http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx	:	Darwin/X11 R  (thanks to Jan!)


specific updates and bug fixing for the Carbon release can be found in

http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macos/base/CHANGES

along with the Carbon FAQ

http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macos/rmac-FAQ.html


Contributed packages for rm140 will come in 2002 !

Message-ID: <4F2872DC-F76C-11D5-B105-00039364CC92@stat.ucla.edu>

You can also install the Darwin/X11 version of R-1.4.0 (base and
recommended) by using fink (see fink.sourceforge.net). This
version (maintained by Jeffrey Whitaker, jsw@cdc.noaa.gov)
uses f2c for the FORTRAN parts.

Fink is a package manager. If you have installed fink (and the
Apple Development Tools) then all you have to say once is

fink install r-base
fink install r-commended

and every once in a while

fink selfupdate
fink update-all

It also makes sense, once you are at it, to install dlcompat, atlas,
g77, and xdarwin from fink.

Hi:

I am a new comer to unix and am trying to install R on MacOSX. I have 
tried both "fink install r-base" and "fink install r-commended" but 
it does not work:

>[gattuso:~] gattuso% fink install r-base
>sudo /sw/bin/fink install r-base

>Failed: no package found for specification 'r-base'!

=46ink seems to work OK because I have successfully downloaded gmt 
(although I am  not able to run it yet...).

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks!

go to /sw/etc/fink.conf and change the Trees: line to

then say "fink install r-base"

=46ink seems to work OK because I have successfully downloaded gmt

Any help would be appreciated.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac]Installing R on Mac OS X.1
Message-ID: <B84FC76F.1E%hannebert@mac.com>

Since December 22th, I'm trying to install R on my mac and it is not yet
running...
Where can I find a complete installation procedure (from A to Z) ?

I understand that before installing R, Xfree86 (for example) or Xdarwin has
to be installed first.

Then some libraries have to be added (but exactly which ones ?) using Fink
for more convenience. I read that "atlas" had to be installed but Fink can't
find it... Same for libz.
Also Fink finds that my installation of Xfree86 / Xdarwin is not complete
(some shared libraries are missing ?) although I used the 4.1.0 / 1.0.5
installer (Mac OS X package)...

Finally, R 1.4.0 has to be installed.
It seems (Jan de Leeuw said it on this mailing list on the 22th of December)
that R can be installed using Fink (fink install r-base / fink install
r-commended) but Fink doesn't fink thoses packages...

Probably I'm too used to Apple installations where any child could do it...

Best regards.

Marc Hannebert.

Those using fink and wanting to install g77, atlas, r-base

Make sure the Trees line in /sw/etc/fink.conf reads

Trees: local/main stable/main stable/crypto unstable/main 
unstable/crypto local/bootstrap

Perhaps you should start off with the Carbon version, for which the
procedure is more Mac-like.  It is apparently a bit slower than the Darwin
version but I'm happy with it even on an iBook.

(a) Go to
  http://cran.r-project.org
and follow the link
    MacOS (System 8.6 to 9.1 and MacOS X)
and then
    base

(b) Download
    rm140_FULL.sit

(c) On my Mac this automatically triggers the UnStuff process, or you may
have to click on the file icon to unstuff it.

(d) Drag the rm140_FULL folder to a suitable place in the Finder

(z) Optionally, drag the <R> icon from that folder to the dock.

Hi:

Jan recommended to modify fink.conf. I have tried to do it with pico 
but it says that it cannot write the file. I guess that it is a 
problem related to permissions. I then search the internet on how to 
change permissions which I tried unsucessfully:


[gattuso:/sw/etc] gattuso% ls -l
total 16
drwxr-xr-x  3 root  admin  264 Nov  4 22:52 alternatives
drwxr-xr-x  4 root  admin  264 Nov  4 22:52 apt

[gattuso:/sw/etc] gattuso% chmod 777 fink.conf

What am I doing wrong?

Thanks,

Compiled with g77, ATLAS, dlcompat.  Support for gnome, tcl/tk, MySQL,
RmSQL, RMySQL, RPgSQL, RPVM, netCDF. Binaries for more
than 150 packages.

This build includes rpart, which was not in the previous build (which
only included the recommended packages).

I will post complete installation instructions (including dylib
notes) asap. Maybe Stefano can put this one on CRAN.

yes, I'll do it next week. Thank you Jan for your efforts.

Anyway, we should merge in some way the installation instructions in the 
MAC-FAQ.

Could you be a tiny bit more specific ? What were the commands and how
did they fail ?

I do not have any of these problems, all your examples run fine. Could 
you
let ne know what Mac, and what Mac OS X you have ? One thing
I could imagine is that ATLAS uses Altivec instructions for single
operations, which means that these problems may occur CPU's
without Altivec. Maybe others could verify. Also, you do need OS X
version 10.1 at least, I think.

Probably simple for you
Previously you wrote
src/macintosh/ReadMe.MPW in R-devel archive (Aug_22_2001 or later).
But where is this R-devel archive? (an ftp archive, or a CVS?)
I never found this

I searched
http://developer.r-project.org/
rsync on http://cran.r-project.org/
http://rsync.r-project.org/
http://cran.r-project.org/
ftp://cran.r-project.org/pub/R/src
ftp://ftp.stat.math.ethz.ch/Software/R
ftp://cran.r-project.org/pub/R/sources.html
(http://cran.it.r-project.org/	 does not exist)

in searches I end up most of the time with some site for the binaries
http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macos/
http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/


I find also source of 1.3.1
http://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-1.3.1.tgz

before I search longer I better ask.

you can find it on CRAN (any mirror) into the Source page, i.e.

http://cran.r-project.org/sources.html

there you find the link to the .tgz devel, patched etc archives

ftp://ftp.stat.math.ethz.ch/Software/R

and inside this you have daily snapshots of thr R-devel source tree.

Hope this helps

R 1.4.0 is now sinking into feature freeze, and I'd like some help
testing it under Macintosh (from Sys 8.6 to X).


I've put a copy of R140b1 at

http://www.ci.tuwien.ac.at/~iacus/R

there are two files: R140b1.sit and R140b1.sit.hqx

download only one of the two.

Many tests have been done but you help will be precious. Several things 
have been changed or implemented both in R internals and Mac GUI.

Problem reports to stefano.iacus@unimi.it or to r-sig-
mac@stat.math.ethz.ch, please.  (At this stage the features are frozen, 
so no feature requests ....)

thanks

Minor issues:
It seems that the formula display has improved a lot. The demo for 
plotmath() still shows some glimpses. (But I do not htink one should 
spend to much time on this. Better convince someone to provide a 
proper quartz driver).

Very minor issues:

Hi all,

I recently updated my system from Mac OS 9.1 to OS X (Version 10.1).
How can I use my currently invisible .RData files (created with R 1.3.1) 
on the new system?
Is there a way to make these files visible/readable on Mac OS X?

Sorry for this OS X beginner question...
Any advice is welcome!

You can see "invisible" files from the term window using commands like 
"ll"

which version of R for mac are you using ? (Carbon or Darwin)

I use the Carbon version of R.
Is there any problem with renaming the .RData file e.g. in RData? And is 
there any application on OS X like 'creator type convertor' to make the 
RData file doubleclickable?
Anyway, loading the workspace file .RData via menu works fine!

You can rename it as you please, but naming it as .RData and putting it=20=

in the same folder as R binary is, will cause R to load that image file=20=

by default at startup.

You can double click on the file and OS X should pop up a dialog asking=20=

I hope this helps you.

In 10.1 in the Get Info dialog you can associate filename suffixes 
with applications.
This might work for double-clicking .Rdata. Of course, that only 
works if you can get the Finder to show it in the first place!

There probably are some shareware or freeware appliations that will 
cause files whose names begin with "." to be shown in the Finder. 
Browse http://www.versiontracker.com/macosx/index.shtml. I thought 
there was a System or Finder preference for this, but I couldn't find 
it.

If you want to install R on Darwin you must do a number of other things. 
Not all
of it is necessary, but most of it will make your life easier (after a 
while), and it
will make your R faster. Of course you may decide to wait on R-1.4.0.

a. Install Fink from fink.sourceforge.net. Use Fink to install libz, 
libreadline,
atlas, libjpeg, libpng, f2c, dlcompat, tcl/tk, and maybe f77/g77. Make 
sure you source
the init.csh file that comes with Fink. This sets /sw/bin at the 
beginning
of your path and it sets DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH. You could also install all 
of Gnome
from Fink (if you want to use --gui=gnome in R).

b. Become an Apple developer (for free) and download and install the 
Apple
developer tools. Go to www.apple.com/developer or connect.apple.com

c. Download the latest version of R-1.3.1 from 
gifi.stat.ucla.edu/R/builds
and install in /usr/local

d. See if it works. If it complains about missing libraries, try

otool -L /usr/local/lib/R/bin/R.bin

and see what it wants. Provide the missing stuff from either Fink or
gifi.stat.ucla.edu/R/dylibs. In the same may you can use otool -L to see
what the tcl/tk or gnome modules are looking for, and the various
precompiled packages.

The latest (final) build of R 1.4.0 has been put in a temporary

You can find it in the usual two forms (full or base+recommended)

full <- c( one archive only containing the base distribution and all the

Get it from ftp://gifi.stat.ucla.edu in pub.

This contains the base files plus the recommended packages (except rpart,
which does not compile yet).

It is compiled under MacOS X 10.1.2 with the December 2001 version of
the Developer Tools, and with g77 from fink.sourceforge net. It has 
support
for gnome, X11R6, and tcl/tk, and it uses the newest ATLAS from fink. It
has two-level namespaces and has a libR.dylib included.

For R,bin you need on your system (remember to set DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH,
or --better-- install fink and compile these things yourself)

        /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current 
version 55.0.0)
         /sw/lib/libz.1.dylib (compatibility version 1.1.3, current

Message-ID: <FDE68498-F6CC-11D5-888F-003065CC4CB8@unimi.it>

I have just uplodaed on CRAN both versions of R 1.4.0.

So starting from Dec 23rd, you'll find the builds for Carbon and Darwin 
directly on CRAN respectively at

http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macos	:	Carbon R (8.6 -> 9.2 and OSX)
http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx	:	Darwin/X11 R  (thanks to Jan!)


specific updates and bug fixing for the Carbon release can be found in

http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macos/base/CHANGES

along with the Carbon FAQ

http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macos/rmac-FAQ.html


Contributed packages for rm140 will come in 2002 !

You can also install the Darwin/X11 version of R-1.4.0 (base and
recommended) by using fink (see fink.sourceforge.net). This
version (maintained by Jeffrey Whitaker, jsw@cdc.noaa.gov)
uses f2c for the FORTRAN parts.

Fink is a package manager. If you have installed fink (and the
Apple Development Tools) then all you have to say once is

fink install r-base
fink install r-commended

and every once in a while

fink selfupdate
fink update-all

It also makes sense, once you are at it, to install dlcompat, atlas,
g77, and xdarwin from fink.

Hi:

I am a new comer to unix and am trying to install R on MacOSX. I have 
tried both "fink install r-base" and "fink install r-commended" but 
it does not work:

>[gattuso:~] gattuso% fink install r-base

>Failed: no package found for specification 'r-base'!

=46ink seems to work OK because I have successfully downloaded gmt 
(although I am  not able to run it yet...).

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks!

go to /sw/etc/fink.conf and change the Trees: line to

then say "fink install r-base"

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac]Installing R on Mac OS X.1
Message-ID: <B84FC76F.1E%hannebert@mac.com>

Since December 22th, I'm trying to install R on my mac and it is not yet
running...
Where can I find a complete installation procedure (from A to Z) ?

I understand that before installing R, Xfree86 (for example) or Xdarwin has
to be installed first.

Then some libraries have to be added (but exactly which ones ?) using Fink
for more convenience. I read that "atlas" had to be installed but Fink can't
find it... Same for libz.
Also Fink finds that my installation of Xfree86 / Xdarwin is not complete
(some shared libraries are missing ?) although I used the 4.1.0 / 1.0.5
installer (Mac OS X package)...

Finally, R 1.4.0 has to be installed.
It seems (Jan de Leeuw said it on this mailing list on the 22th of December)
that R can be installed using Fink (fink install r-base / fink install
r-commended) but Fink doesn't fink thoses packages...

Probably I'm too used to Apple installations where any child could do it...

Best regards.

Marc Hannebert.

Those using fink and wanting to install g77, atlas, r-base

Make sure the Trees line in /sw/etc/fink.conf reads

Trees: local/main stable/main stable/crypto unstable/main 
unstable/crypto local/bootstrap

Perhaps you should start off with the Carbon version, for which the
procedure is more Mac-like.  It is apparently a bit slower than the Darwin
version but I'm happy with it even on an iBook.

(a) Go to
  http://cran.r-project.org
and follow the link
    MacOS (System 8.6 to 9.1 and MacOS X)
and then
    base

(b) Download
    rm140_FULL.sit

(c) On my Mac this automatically triggers the UnStuff process, or you may
have to click on the file icon to unstuff it.

(d) Drag the rm140_FULL folder to a suitable place in the Finder

(z) Optionally, drag the <R> icon from that folder to the dock.

Hi:

Jan recommended to modify fink.conf. I have tried to do it with pico 
but it says that it cannot write the file. I guess that it is a 
problem related to permissions. I then search the internet on how to 
change permissions which I tried unsucessfully:


[gattuso:/sw/etc] gattuso% ls -l
total 16
drwxr-xr-x  3 root  admin  264 Nov  4 22:52 alternatives
drwxr-xr-x  4 root  admin  264 Nov  4 22:52 apt
drwxr-xr-x  3 root  admin  264 Nov  4 22:52 dpkg
-rw-r--r--  1 root  admin    6 Nov  4 22:52 fink-release
-rw-r--r--  1 root  admin  387 Nov  4 22:54 fink.conf
drwxr-xr-x  3 root  admin   58 Nov  4 22:52 profile.d
[gattuso:/sw/etc] gattuso% chmod 777 fink.conf
chmod: fink.conf: Operation not permitted



What am I doing wrong?

Thanks,
jp

In

ftp://gifi.stat.ucla.edu/pub/R-1.4.0-MacOSX-full.tar.gz

Compiled with g77, ATLAS, dlcompat.  Support for gnome, tcl/tk, MySQL,
RmSQL, RMySQL, RPgSQL, RPVM, netCDF. Binaries for more
than 150 packages.

This build includes rpart, which was not in the previous build (which
only included the recommended packages).

I will post complete installation instructions (including dylib
notes) asap. Maybe Stefano can put this one on CRAN.

yes, I'll do it next week. Thank you Jan for your efforts.

Anyway, we should merge in some way the installation instructions in the 
MAC-FAQ.

Could you be a tiny bit more specific ? What were the commands and how
did they fail ?

Peter

I do not have any of these problems, all your examples run fine. Could 
you
let ne know what Mac, and what Mac OS X you have ? One thing
I could imagine is that ATLAS uses Altivec instructions for single
operations, which means that these problems may occur CPU's
without Altivec. Maybe others could verify. Also, you do need OS X
version 10.1 at least, I think.
