Message-ID: <DF8BBD2D-32F3-482C-BE1A-D9EF966A42AA@epfl.ch>

Hello,

I built R from source and when I run R CMD check it prints the  
following error while checking R code for possible problems.

...
* checking R code for possible problems ... NOTE
The process has forked and you cannot use this CoreFoundation  
functionality safely. You MUST exec().
Break on  
__THE_PROCESS_HAS_FORKED_AND_YOU_CANNOT_USE_THIS_COREFOUNDATION_FUNCTIONALITY___YOU_MUST_EXEC__ 
() to debug.
<snip - same 2 lines a whole bunch of times>
* checking Rd files ... OK
...

The package passes R CMD check on linux. Any ideas on how I can fix it?

Thanks,
Kjell

Where do you get into those problems? The above error occurs on  
Leopard when a "fork"ed applications attempts to use CF calls.  
However, It's not clear to me 1) how you get a forked R and 2) how you  
get to call libraries using CF.

So far I encountered this problem only in the setup Rserve+Cairo,  
because Rserve forks R to allow multiple connections. This can be  
worked around by using more recent freetype with cairo (old FT used  
FSRef API unnecessarily which in turn calls CF). Nonetheless, if your  
package relies on both forking and CF, you have no way out - it will  
be unsupported on Mac OS X 10.5.

Cheers,
Simon

Hi Simon.

Just to follow up on this:

I now have a version of rgl that compiles and installs and pretends to 
use FreeType, but it displays junk on OS X 10.4.  It works fine on 
Windows and Linux.  Can you let me know if you've worked out 
instructions for how to get FreeType to work properly?

If you want to see what it's like, you can get a prerelease copy from 
http://www.stats.uwo.ca/faculty/murdoch/temp/rgl_0.77.659.tar.gz. 
example(text3d) will show off a selection of fonts.  It doesn't try to 
get system fonts, only some TrueType fonts that I've included in the 
package.

Just as another data point, I have seen this when running R under gdb 
debugging the quartz() device.  But that did not surprise me (gdb forks on 
the systems I know about), and it worked enough to identify the bug.

After a little digging around...

It turns out that perl is responsible for this error. Although it is  
not mentioned in './configure --help', it appears that if the PERL  
environment variable is set then its value is put in R_HOME/etc/ 
Renviron during configure. This must have been the case for me as R  
somehow picked up a single threaded perl build that is not in my path.

Thanks,
Kjell

I discovered empirically that cat("\r") in the R.app console emits a

found for which that is true.  (The R Windows GUI and all terminals, even 
on Mac OS, just move to the beginning of the line.)

The reason for testing was txtProgressBar() in pre-2.7.0, which expects \r 
to do a carriage return, only (as documented in ?Quotes).  I could change 
this to use backspaces (less reliably), but it would seem better to make 
the console consistent with the documentation and e.g. Terminal.

That's probably because NSTextView behaves more like Classic MacOS
where \r was the newline character rather than \n or \r\n. I'm not
sure there's a straightforward way of changing that behavior without
some pretty big changes to NSTextView.

 From ?quartz and an entry in this list I understand that Quartz screen

and

quartz(width=6,height=6)
plot(1:4)

You didn't tell us the version of R.  quartz() is different in 2.7.0 
alpha, and there the function arguments do work (and the size is really 
as advertised and not at a notional 72dpi).  In fact, it is a much more 
standard device and interface, so less to learn.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Executing older intalled versions of R
Message-ID: <070A5D50-E8CF-4A6C-B2B0-FF1AF6C06F7E@mac.com>

Hi All,

For some automated software building, I need to be able to execute  
older versions of R via the command line.  Currently, even if I  
provide the full path to the R shell script, the current version of R  
gets executed.  For instance,

	/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.4/Resources/bin/R --version
	R version 2.6.2 (2008-02-08)
	Copyright (C) 2008 The R Foundation for Statistical Computing
	ISBN 3-900051-07-0
	[...]

and

	[Straight:~] warnes% /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.4/ 
Resources/bin/R RHOME
	/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources

and

	[Straight:~] warnes% /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.4/ 
Resources/bin/R
	
	R version 2.6.2 (2008-02-08)
	Copyright (C) 2008 The R Foundation for Statistical Computing
	ISBN 3-900051-07-0
	[...]


Is there a particular reason why the R shell script defines

	R_HOME_DIR=/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources

instead of

	VERSION=2.4 # or whatever
	R_HOME_DIR=/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/$VERSION$/Resources

with similar changes through the rest of the file?

-Greg

Please, what information is lacking in my first post?

I've looked at installed.packages() and it seems to me that quartz() is 
"bundled" with the "main software" more than installed with a given 
package.

Is it possible to pass height and width in pixels more than in inches 
working with 2.7.0 alfa?

As I read in http://developer.R-project.org/, R-alpha*.tar.gz packages 
are made automatically available, but I guess there is not *.dmg for 
these stages.

Thanks for your help,

Ricardo

It was missing in the post I replied to.

It is part of package grDevices in 2.7.0 alpha.

Yes, since the dpi can be set.  I'm not sure why you would want to do 
that, mind you.

There are, thanks to Simon Urbanek at http://r.research.att.com/.  (The 
main CRAN Mac OS X page says so.)  (You want the R-2-7-branch version: the 
'tiger' dmg should run on Leopard according to the notes.)

(I've never tested these, as building from the sources is easy enough.)

Thanks. It must be also true for 2.6.2.

To control appearance of graphics produced for the web.

We are trying to introduce R in our workflow. It is easy to figure out 
why. Currently, Excel, SPSS and several software flavors producing 
graphics and tables are involved. A kind of mess that nevertheless 
works. But I am sure R can substitute each and all  of these tools and 
to add a great deal of advantages. We keep discussions about papers we 
prepare in a wiki system. To produce neat graphics from R to be display 
in wiki pages is a must for me now.

To build my own binaries of several FOSS projects I working with is high 
in my ToDo list! But I will take profit of Simon's work to re-start with 
R now. Thanks to Simon.

Thanks for your help,

My understanding is that in 2.6.2 it is part of the R.app GUI.  (There is 
a legacy device in package grDevices.)

In that case you don't want a screen device.  There are new versions of 
png() and jpeg() as well as new bmp() and tiff() devices, and they all 
work in pixels and have options to use Quartz (although that is not 
necessarily preferable to the cairo options, depending on how the latter 
work out by release time).

There are a lot of new features in pre-2.7.0, and with it going into beta 
in a bit over a day now is a good time for MacOS users to start trying it 
out.

Mostly compatibility. A global script would stop working after an  
update if it used hard-coded versions. External tools should make no  
assumptions about the internal versioning scheme. Only embedding  
applications (e.g. the GUI) rely on the versioning scheme and they  
will obtain R_HOME from the linked library so they are not affected  
(ever since the framework has an ID - if you want to use versions  
before the ID introduction, you may have to add one).

Starting R from a different version than the current one is not tested  
or supported, and may not work - in particular older versions won't  
(some versions were explicitly using the "current" version regardless  
of the versioned path).

Clearly, you're free to compile R with a different framework path and  
you're also free to modify the script - it's all up to you - but that  
is not the default setup.

I'm not quite sure why it is an issue in your case - as with all Mac  
OS X frameworks, the established (Apple) way to switch versions is by  
changing the Versions/Current symlink and that is supported.

Cheers,
Simon

Thanks. I see I have a huge range of options. To use a screen device was 
the obvious alternative for a newbie like me, but of course it is absurd 
as it forces me to capture and store each generated Quartz window. So, I 
will immediately move to the functions designed to generate bitmaps.

Following your reply I've also reached Cairo's website. It looks a quite 
interesting project! Thanks again to Simon  and all contributors.

Thanks Demitri. It easy to understand and to use. Even though I think it 
only applies to 72dpi graphical devices, doesn't it?

As you said: the point for you are proportions, so it is not of key 
importance if you are working with 72 or any other resolution display 
device.

Hi, David.  It looks like you have a parenthesis next to the number;
that would explain the error.  If that isn't the issue, you'll want to
include a self-contained example that reproduces the error.

Hope that helps.

David,

Feel free to reply to the list; everyone learns by doing so.

I'm just guessing, but it looks like the file that you sent is an
excel spreadsheet.  It was impossible to tell, though.  You will need
to save that as a text file (csv) from excel before you can read it
into R using read.csv().  Your file should be entirely readable in
textedit if you want to read it with read.csv().  If I am incorrect
about the file type, then you'll need to send along a text version.

Dear R.Gui developers

While testing out the wonderful graphics window in 2.7.0, I decided 
to see about saving a figure.

(Save does not seem to be an option in 2.7.0)

So,  I tried:
>  quartz("test1",type="pdf")
>  plot(1:5,1:5)
>  dev.off()
null device
           1

This leads to a figure that is the mirror image of the correct one.

However, as in 2.6.2,
>  pdf()
>  plot(1:6,1:6)
>  dev.off()
creates a file that is correct.



R version 2.7.0 alpha (2008-04-05 r45110)

Yes, that's known (and I have reported it to Simon).  There is code in 
place intended to do the flipping, and similar code works for type="png".
So we need someone who understands Quartz better than me to look at it.

Thanks, it should be fixed now. [Sorry for the delay, I have  
completely forgotten about it.] Some more GUI-related fixed should  
follow soon.

Could you please test it and let us know?  (As I said yesterday, there are 
builds on r.research.att.com.)

When you last mentioned it I took a look, but my Mac does not have any 
Chinese fonts installed so I can't even plot on screen.  That makes me 
think that only people who use Chinese are likely to be able to test this.

BTW, your message is marked as being in us-ascii when it plainly is not, 
so we are not seeing what I presume are Chinese characters there.  So it 
is not just the quartz device that has encoding issues ....

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] R GUI menu bar quirkiness with new quartz windows
Message-ID: <e1fc21b0804071709o86245e8hf0810bfd599dce14@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

While checking out the very nice new quartz interface I noticed some
oddness with the quartz menu in the menu bar.  I know there's been
discussion of the quartz window lately, but I didn't notice this issue
mentioned.

I am using R 2.7 r45127 and GUI 1.24 r5056 on 10.5.2.  I retrieved
these this morning from the R Mac website, hopefully they are the
latest.

I get multiple quartz menus if I close the plotting window.  I've
attempted to include a screen shot, we'll see if it gets through.  I
am able to reproduce it by calling any plot command, then closing the
plotting window (clicking in the upper left or command-W) and calling
the plot command again.

Thanks for all your efforts,

Peter

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] A .csv question
Message-ID: <47FBB541.3080502@education.wisc.edu>

Hi,

No doubt I'm writing to the wrong R list and some cranky person will 
flame me as a reminder, but I seem to have this problem just on the Mac 
version of R.  Here is the scenario.   I am using SPSS on the PC to save 
a file as a .csv.  I then bring this file into R and have it read the 
file as a .csv.  When I look at the file in Mac Excel, it looks like a 
regular spreadsheet without commas as I might expect.  When I run the 
model, I get the message

Error in scan(file, what, nmax, sep, dec, quote, skip, nlines, 
na.strings,  :
  scan() expected 'a real', got '3196)'


The 3196 is the sample size used for this analysis and it is correct.  I 
can ask it to print the data and the correlation matrix, and everything 
seems fine.  There are no additional characters (such as a parentheses) 
in the file.  My students who are doing this analysis for a class 
assignment do not seem to have a problem on the PC, so I am wondering if 
anyone has encountered an incompatibility problems.

Thanks in advance, and I apologize if this is the wrong list.

David

Hi David,

I'll let others flame you on this.

The question I have is why use the intermediate step of converting the
file to *.csv format? The foreign library allows you to read SPSS *.tab
files directly. The plus to doing it directly is that it has a higher
probability of maintaining the correct variable types then does the use
of a pure text format such as CSV.

A guess, and only a guess, but a csv file at heart is a text file,  
and I would assume it has PC line-enders, which could cause problems.

This is the same problem you had on Monday, in the "Error message "got a 
real'" thread.  That's not a .csv file.  Excel recognizes what it is 
despite what you named it, but R is trying to read it as a CSV file, and 
it isn't.

Look at it in a text editor, and you'll see that it's not really a .csv 
file.

Hi, David.

Might or might not be a problem, but it looks like you are mixing
package versions and R versions.  When writing to the list, you will
always want to include the output of sessionInfo().  In this
particular case, you will want to remove the offending packages and
re-install them.

I know it is hard to remember to do it, but when you use ANY new
function in R, it is essential to read the help page.  I think the
answer is on the help page.

Another comment - this does not look like the latest version of foreign 
(0.8-24). That handles encodings (warning 3) and does not give warning 4.

I've not seen warning 5 before, but presume that like warning 4 it is 
harmless.

Since this is a Mac, all locales are UTF-8 (at least on the console) and 
you do want Windows encodings to be handled.  Please update your 
'foreign'.

I appreciate the time to look at this.  I checked Foreign and now have 
used the updated version 8-24.

Here is my sessionInfo()

foreign_0.8-24     

loaded via a namespace (and not attached):

Here is my error message.

1: In read.spss("~/Desktop/math.sav") :

(1252) looks like a Windows codepage
2: In read.spss("~/Desktop/math.sav") :

Thanks in advance.

And what is there to look at?  The first warning tells you it looks like a 
Windows codepage -- but it will have attempted to handle it.
'Attempted' because SPSS often sometimes marks incorrectly.

The second warning is about something unknown (to read.spss and to me).

Message-ID: <e1fc21b0804091427p3c906685pf3f8985268c6b89e@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

My first message bounced so I am trying again with a smaller image.

While checking out the very nice new quartz interface I noticed some
oddness with the quartz menu in the menu bar.  I know there's been
discussion of the quartz window lately, but I didn't notice this issue
mentioned.

I am using R 2.7 r45127 and GUI 1.24 r5056 on 10.5.2.  I retrieved
these this morning from the R Mac website, hopefully they are the
latest.

I get multiple quartz menus if I close the plotting window.  I've
attempted to include a screen shot, we'll see if it gets through.  I
am able to reproduce it by calling any plot command, then closing the
plotting window (clicking in the upper left or command-W) and calling
the plot command again.

Thanks for all your efforts,

Peter

Peter,

Thanks for your report. I noticed it as well and will be resolved asap.
Also, all the Quartz R.app features/preferences are not yet linked to
the new Quartz code (location, size, etc.).

Regards,
Rob

Rune,
I recently stumbled upon "Keyboard Maestro", a program for defining
keyboard macros.
(I had to deal quickly with a broken key.)
This solves the problem you mention, 
-- and many other peeves with the Mac interface.
You can easily define ctrl-R (restricted to R.app) to be Cmd-Enter
Down-Arrow.
Then you can step through your code comfortably.
It's commercial, but cheap, and I got near instant user support when I
hit a snag.

A few years ago MacroMagic on Windows scared me off of keyboard macro
programs.
(Amazingly, it would diddle a bit in the floating point processor,
which would then fool Splus in its handling of NA's in certain settings
--- bizarre!!)
But so far so good with this one.

Message-ID: <20080411173102.2y89ufeq8s8k44og@imp.inserm.fr>

Hi,

I just saw this on http://www.macosxhints.com/ and it seems
to work OK with R.  If you want to open multiple sessions of
the R GUI, you can run from terminal,

open -n /Applications/R.app

I know that you could always run multiple R sessions using
the terminal, but I thought that you could only have one
R.app running for a given R.app.

I would be curious if there are any down sides to this;
any reasons to proscribe it.

I should add that this seems to be a feature of Mac 0S 10.5 as
I don't see it working in Tiger, nor so I see the -h option
in the man page for open on Tiger.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Unable to do a CLEAN reinstall of R 2.6.2
Message-ID: <C7B152BC-95B5-496D-9F1E-90DEB447840A@gmail.com>

Hello,

I had problems with rcmdr and tcl/tk before but straightened them  
out.  this time, I am really stuck.

I was having alot of issues with Rgrphviz so I fiured I would just  
start over.  I uninstalled all the R folder, libraries, frameworks,  
and packages.  I then downloaded the latest (2008-02-08) version of R  
2.6.2 for my Mac OSX (10.4.11)  I also have X11 installed (1.1.3) and  
was able to run some sort of X11 update from apple.  I also tried  
xcode tools download from apple, but it didnt give me an option to  
install X11 again.

When I install R from the disk image, it says that there was an error  
with the installation.  When i try to install the tcl/tk package  
alone, it also says error with the installation.  It seems like its  
installing R and Rgui, but nothing else.

After starting R (gui) I installed rcmdr and the dependencies.  I  
then started X11 and tried to load rcmdr.  Here is what I got:

Loading required package: tcltk
Loading Tcl/Tk interface ... Error in fun(...) :
   Can't find a usable init.tcl in the following directories:
     @TCL_IN_FRAMEWORK@ @TCL_IN_FRAMEWORK@

This probably means that Tcl wasn't installed properly.

In addition: Warning messages:
1: In library() :
   library ?/Users/brendancasey/Library/R/2.6/library? contains no  
packages
2: In library() :
   library ?/Users/brendancasey/Library/R/2.6/library? contains no  
packages
Error : .onLoad failed in 'loadNamespace' for 'tcltk'
Error: package 'tcltk' could not be loaded
____________________________
I dont mind uninstalling more folders and starting from scratch (X11,  
R, Rgui, etc), but I am not prepared to reinstall my OS if that is  
what it will take.

Can someone please help me with this?

The default works -- you have set options("repos") somewhere.
You can use

options(repos=c(CRAN="http://cran.<insert>.r-project.org"))

*However*, I noticed last night that the 2.7 MacOS binary packages on CRAN 
are way out of date (late Nov 2007), which is worrying when we are 
supposed to be beta-testing (and the Windows equivalent has been running 
for a month now).

I suggest that until that is updated you use

install.packages("pkgname", type="source")

which has worked for me.

Peter,

thanks for the report. This (and a few other issues) should be fixed  
now.

Brendan,

you have likely an infinite softlink in /usr/local. Please verify that  
your /usr/local and /usr/local/lib is in order. If the error still  
persists, please send us the installer log from the failed installation.

Cheers,
Simon

PS: Please don't set high-priority flags on your emails, it's  
superfluous and considered rude by some.

It works with .us. as <insert>. Thanks

$repos
                          CRAN
"http://cran.us.r-project.org"

Available packages are listed in R.app GUI and install.packages() 
command pops up a window with the available packages as well.

What I don't know is how...

$repos
                                                        CRAN
"http://r.research.att.com/bin/macosx/universal/contrib/2.7"

...reached my installation. Must the 2.7.0 beta installer be blamed for 
that?

OK. I'll do that. Please, is there any alert system to be aware of 
updates other than "go and see"? Thanks.

Both.

I've not installed other R.app GUI than the one coming with 
R-2.7-branch-45232.dmg.

Each time I open a new starts a graphics device driver by submitting 
quartz, a new quartz menu is added to the Mac OS X upper menu bar. If I 
close a given device, the menu entry remains.

Is this the expected behavior?

Perhaps I must close quartz in any other way to get this menu gone, but 
even in this case it seems to me that it will be advisable to state this 
clearly in ?quartz.

Thanks!

Thanks for the catch - the builds are online for some time and recent:

imac86:bin$ ls -lt 2.7|head
total 1430480
-rw-r--r--   1 urbanek  admin     19875 Apr 11 02:29 epsi_1.0-3.tgz
-rw-r--r--   1 urbanek  admin    200957 Apr 11 02:28 epitools_0.4-9.tgz

However, the mirroring was not syncing 2.7 packages properly. It  
should be fixed now.

@Kurt, can you, please, add MacOSX R-beta checks results to the  
webpages?

Thanks,
Simon

I just tried running R 2.6.2 for Mac OS X and it crashed. The crash log 
is attached.

Hopefully this can help with the problem.

Thanks. I am afraid I keep messing things up: there is also a Default 
CRAN mirror overwriting any other repos setting. I will update to the 
last nightly build and come back here with feedback.

I've reply some hours ago to the Peter's message but it seems I am 
having some kind of problem here. Please, allow me to re-post here my 
message. Thanks!

*****
Thanks Peter.

I've installed what I see as last builds both for R.app GUI and R 
framework. Here what I have:

 > version
_
platform i386-apple-darwin9.2.2
arch i386
os darwin9.2.2
system i386, darwin9.2.2
status beta
major 2
minor 7.0
year 2008
month 04
day 12
svn rev 45280
language R
version.string R version 2.7.0 beta (2008-04-12 r45280)
 >

And R GUI 1.24-devel (5072)

I get now ONLY one Quartz entry in the upper menu. Great!

Nevertheless, what I am not seing now is the semi-transparent canvas 
when an on-screen devices are launched. This makes a differences whith 
I've been seing before and I think this is not what I must expect by 
reading ?quartz...

"On-screen devices are launched with a semi-transparent canvas. Once a 
new plot is created, the canvas is first painted with the canvas colour 
and then the current background colour (which can be transparent or 
semi-transparent). Off-screen devices have no canvas colour, and so 
start with a transparent background where possible (e.g. type="png" and 
type="tiff") ? otherwise it appears that a solid white canvas is assumed 
in the Quartz code."

Is this worth to be reported any other place or is this the right 
channel? Thanks!!

Cheers,

Ricardo

Not really - please check your R.app preferences ...

Message-ID: <e1fc21b0804131500y299eb3e6tfb1be035a8e69afb@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I'm having trouble with the quartz.save(), I know this is an
undocumented function, and perhaps it is to be removed in 2.7.0.
However, I find it very useful though I have been having trouble with
it lately.

Specifically, I get:

> quartz()
> plot(0,0)
> quartz.save('temp.pdf')
Error in .Call("QuartzSaveContents", device, file, type, list(...)) :
  C symbol name "QuartzSaveContents" not in load table

I know that quartz.save() has been discussed recently on the list, but
I didn't see this particular issue addressed.

Thanks

Peter

Message-ID: <p0624080cc428536d652b@[165.124.162.151]>

Dear Simon and the R-Gui wizards,

Following up my post of last night, I tried the same sequence in the 
most recent release. The problem reoccurs, but seems to be a problem 
with the way Acrobat is interacting with the pdf file.

x <- 1:10
y <- x^2
quartz(type="pdf")
plot(x,y,typ="b")
dev.off()

This creates the new file Rplots.pdf.  When I open this with Acrobat, 
some of the points are missing.  The line is there. The scale size in 
Acrobat is 266%.  But if I rescale the Acrobat window down to 150% or 
less, the points come back,  but then disappear again if I rescale 
up.  (At a large scale you can drag the figure around.  Points come 
and go as you move the graph around!)

If I open the file with Preview,  the points are there to start with 
no matter what.

I'm getting exactly the same behavior here. Same R.app GUI, r5072, 
version.string R version 2.7.0 beta (2008-04-12 r45280).

And I also find this function really useful. Sorry, I've not followed 
previous discussions, so I am not aware of possible alternatives. Accept 
my apologies if they are quite obvious.

Thanks,

Ricardo

Hi Peter & Ricardo

The same thing can be done in 2.7.0 with:

quartz(type="pdf", file="/Users/username/wherever")
plot(0,0)
dev.off()

help(quartz) for additional options


Best wishes,

Todd

I don't think so: that does not save the current plot.  You could adapt 
dev.copy2pdf() to come very close (or just use it -- R's pdf device will 
copy well enough unless you need exotic fonts).

I think the changes needed are from

     oc$device <- pdf
     oc$onefile <- FALSE
     if (is.null(oc$paper))
         oc$paper <- "special"
to
     oc$device <- quartz
     oc$type <- "pdf"

but I'm not sitting in front of a Mac.

(Had quartz(type="pdf") been working at feature freeze for 2.7.0 we might 
have made this an option in dev.copy2pdf, but it was broken until 
recently.)

quartz.save() can also be easily emulated using dev.copy:

quartz.save(file,type="pdf",...) {
 dev.copy(quartz,file=file,type=type,...)
 dev.close()
}

which also lets you do things like...

quartz.save("clipboard://")

which copies directly to the clipboard (handy for people making
Keynote presentations)

Well, dev.copy2pdf *is* using dev.copy, and would also allow 
file="clipboard://".  It does a number of other things necessary to 
produce a reasonably accurate copy, though, which is why I suggested 
starting from it.

I've been trying to see how this .Rprofile works here, but it seems to 
me that whatever option I set there, the one active when I launch R.app 
is the one set in Startup preferences.

I am guessing, .Rprofile has not effect at least with this setting when 
R.app is used, am I wrong? Thanks!

Hello Simon -
I am unable to get locator() to terminate, either using ESC
or using the middle/right mouse button.  This is also true
when I use the quartz device when running R from the
command line.  Closing the graphics window does terminate
the device, and generates a bus error.

With the x11 device all is fine, whether from R.app or from
the command line.

Hi Dr. Ripley:

The previous quartz help did not list "pdf" in the output formats, but
nevertheless seemed to save "pdf" files, although with the recently
discussed upside down and backwards problem that has been corrected...

The quartz help now includes:
"Off-screen output types produce output files and utilize the file argument.
type = "pdf" gives PDF output. The following bitmap formats may be supported
(on OS X 10.4 and later): "png", "jpeg", "jpg", "jpeg2000", "tif", "tiff",
"gif", "psd" (Adobe Photoshop), "bmp" (Windows bitmap), "sgi" and "pict".
(The availability of some formats is OS-version-dependent.)"

This is using the latest R 2.7.0 r45298 and R GUI(5074)

Best wishes,

Todd

Just upside down in quartz(type= "pdf").

Yes, I can read the help (I even wrote some of that)!  If by 'previous' 
you mean in 2.6.2, it was a different quartz device and quartz.save() did 
not use dev.copy (it was part of the R.app GUI's quartz() device).

So I don't see your point.  Mine was that I added "quartz" options to e.g 
png() because quartz(type = "png") worked at that point, but not to 
dev.copy2pdf() because quartz(type = "pdf") produced useless output at 
that time.

Which messages?  R.app and R itself handle this differently for their 
messages.

You will find a discussion in the 'R Installation and Administration' 
manual.  You don't give an address, but I suspect you are in a 
Spanish-speaking locale.  I believe the Mac OS port of R uses the stanard 
libintl from the R sources, in which case you can read for yourself how 
libintl determines the message language in the src/extra/intl directory.

Even simpler: it was an encoding issue with my data file. I was saving 
it in MacRoman when UTF8 is possible, advisable and required. Thank you 
so much for your help.

"Prof" is not universally ranked above "Dr". I remember my first job in 
Canada where academics were often miffed at being addressed as 
"Professor" rather than "Doctor". It seemed to imply that they didn't 
have a PhD.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] a question of alphabetical order [follow-up]
Message-ID: <48067653.8050208@xen.net>

Hi,

This issue comes from a thread of the same title, "a question of 
alphabetical order", initiated yesterday in r-help at r-project.org list. 
As it affects  now only Mac environment, I follow Brian Ripley's advice 
and move it to this list.

It is now clear that ordering lists/variable values is a kind of 
nightmare whatever platform we use. As I (and possible many others!) 
need to get a right order, or an "as right as possible" order, for list 
of strings using non-ASCII character, namely ?????, ????? and ?,?, we 
have been considering a number of options.

Hans-Joerg Bibiko proposed a customized function to do the trick. Brian 
Ripley spoke about es_ES.ISO8859-15 doing almost the right thing for 
these characters.

Here what I get working in a MacBook which environment I describe at the 
bottom of the message:

http://mire.environmentalchange.net/~webmaster/images/toPlot.png

Here the code:

Sys.setlocale(category = "LC_ALL", locale = "es_ES.ISO8859-15")
toPlot <- data.frame(medio=c("avi?n", "barco", "bicicleta", "?ngulo", 
"choco", "cami?n", "coche", "tren", "aleta", "luna", "llave"),

As you see in the order of labels, accent is not ignored, and ch and ll 
are considered as single instances. These are not longer the case with 
Spanish alphabetical order. It changed in 1994.

So, Hans's solution seems the only one available to the correct order. 
At least working with in the environment described below.

In any case, please,

1. Are you aware of any new locale we could try to see if it is already 
updated?
2. If it doesn't exist, how/where must we go to propose/start creating 
such e locale?

Here the environment:

Your 'nightmare' does seems specific to Mac OS.  Your example is collated 
correctly in all the es_ES locales on my Linux box, and also in 
es_ES.UTF-8 on Solaris 10.

We have no idea what data you collected to assert 'whatever platform we 
use'.  UTF-8 locales on Mac OS X are the only instance in C where I am 
aware of the use of Unicode point order (quite a few scripting languages 
do it, though).  If the problem were widespread I would expect it to be 
reported more than it is (and 'ls' output is locale-specific in recent 
versions of Linux, and my IT team did get several help requests about 
that).

Collation is a tricky area, but that does not mean that OS designers are 
in general shy of it.  There was a concerted project, the Unicode 
Collation Algorithm, and several OSes have implementations including 
national 'tailorings'.

What can be done about it?  The obvious answer is to use a reliable OS. 
Alternatively, R is making use of the system's C collation functions and 
those could be replaced.  In current R (>= 2.7.0) this is centralized in 
src/main/utils.c, in the code (not Windows)

# ifdef HAVE_STRCOLL
#  define STRCOLL strcoll
# else
#  define STRCOLL strcmp
# endif

int Scollate(SEXP a, SEXP b)
{
     return STRCOLL(translateChar(a), translateChar(b));
}

Mac OS X has strcoll (it is a C99 function, so that test is historical), 
and what would be needed would be to replace it by a more functional 
version.  My suspicion is that Mac OS X does have proper collation 
functionality (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Locale_Data_Repository 
appears to claim it uses CDLR data), but that it is not used in the ISO 
C99 part of the OS.  For example, Cocoa seems to have a function 
'localizedCompare'.


BTW, Ei-ji Nakama was already replaced the broken wctype and wcwidth 
functions in Mac OS: see file src/main/rlocale.c

I was clearly wrong. I must be more cautious in using this asseverations 
as I am a simple user with some experience working in Windows boxes,  a 
very recent nice feelings working with Mac OS X and a very short 
knowledge in Suse Linux 9.x. So it is not advisable pick up comments 
here and to pretend reach a solid conclusion. Please, accept my apologies.

Well, I am afraid I have to invest some hours trying to digest all what 
you have said here! I will come back as soon as possible with feedback.

Thank you so much for your time and insight.

Best regards,

Ricardo

Hello All,
I am having a problem with loading tcl/tk particularly when using the
install.packages function on Leopard. I have custom build my binary for my
dual core leopard and use type="source" argument in install.packages. No X11
issues any where else and X11 is launching as required when install.packages
is invoked. Can somebody suggest a way to overcome this problem. I am
attaching my R transcript file for the session.
Thanks in advance,

No, you didn't something wrong. This menu item is missing in the  
German version caused by issue, I believe, it's relatively new.

To solve that problem quickly, you can replace to "old" file  
"MainMenu.nib" in

Applications > R.app > Contents > Resources > de.lproj

by the attached file "MainMenu.nib". (Make a backup of the old  
MainMenu.nib in beforehand for safety reasons!)

Hint: To open the content of R.app press CTRL+mouse click (or the  
right button of your mouse) and choose "Zeige Paketinhalt" (I believe  
that's the name in German for Show Package Content)

Otherwise, I believe that this bug will be fixed as soon as possible  
by the R.app developers with the new release.

Cheers,

--Hans

Shripad,

my guess would be that you don't have working Tcl/Tk developer setup.  
The fact that your Tcl/Tk doesn't work is not apparent until run-time,  
because missing symbols are reported only at load time. Make sure you  
have installed X11 Tcl/Tk that comes with R (or compile one yourself).

Cheers,
Simon

Sorry for not answering your first message. It didn't work, and I've had

As for the loops, far clear. Thanks!

What version of R do you have installed on the Intel Mac?

I suggest you take the problem to the R-SIG-Mac list.  It appears that
there is a mismatch between the libraries on the machine that
generated the Mac binary package and your machine.

Needing to install certain versions of libraries in /usr/local is one
of the reasons that I don't bother trying to run R on a Mac, other
than for the vanilla stuff.

Well, then you have to enlighten us as of where you get it from,  
because it's not from CRAN. If you compiled it yourself from sources,  
then you cannot just move it from one machine to another unless you  
also copy the dependencies (gfortran library in your case). Please be  
specific about what you are doing otherwise we have no way of helping  
you.

Cheers,
Simon

It appears that he is not using our binaries at all which is why he  
runs into problems (it is unclear because he failed to supply basic  
details).

The seems to be a rather wide-spread urban legend. R does *not*  
install anything in /usr/local, it is completely independent of /usr/ 
local for its functionality. We go into great lengths to provide self- 
contained binaries even for some packages that require 3rd party  
libraries. The only exception to this rule are some UI kits as there  
is no way to embed them (without installing them into R framework  
completely).
The R installer provides *optional* tools that can be installed in / 
usr/local if desired, but those are not necessary in order to run R  
(and are not part of R itself).

Cheers,
Simon

Dear Simon,
   many thanks for your reply!
   oops, sorry for the confusion........that was a typo. I HAVE 
installed the latest version 0.999375-13 (I dropped a 9 in my 
message......). It is this latest version that DOES not install in R 
2.6.2. I should mention that I need this latest version because 
earlier versions generated divergent scale estimates and Dr. Bates 
has very nicely reworked the estimation scheme so that divergent 
estimates would not appear. I know that 0.999375-13 DOES WORK on a 
Power PC Mac. As my message stated, it does NOT install on an Intel 
Mac

SO, the problem remains. Any help is much appreciated!

Hello Simon,

Thanks for the suggestion. I have looked in the corresponding directory:

/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.6/Resources/library/tcltk/libs
$ ll
total 80
-rwxr-xr-x  1 root  admin  37564 Mar  5 13:19 tcltk.so

And I do have the tcltk.so file. I have followed all the instructions given
here 

http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/RMacOSX-FAQ.html#X11-TclTk-headers-and-
libraries-_0028optional_0029

for installing Tcl/Tk.

 

I have even downloaded the R source and used the source in to compile again.
Then used the tcltk.so from there. Still no luck.

So if I need to recompile tcltk.so, can you/anyone please help me by giving
some details about how to go about it.

Thanks,

Well, that binary is not from CRAN. Please file this as a bug report  
with R-Forge. Apparently they require you to install gfortran (see http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools/
) in order to use their binaries.

That doesn't say much - you need to use otool -L to see which Tcl/Tk  
it's referring to (if any).

I have no idea what you're tying to do ;).
Can you, please, start by stating your goal? Are you trying to compile  
R from sources for some reason? Do you want a specific (non-standard)  
Tcl/Tk version?

If you just want a working R with Tcl/Tk then please download it from  
CRAN and you're all set (the full installer contains R and Tcl/Tk).

If you want your custom R with some custom Tcl/Tk then you have to  
compile and install Tcl/Tk *first*, then configure R and make sure it  
is using your custom Tcl/Tk during the configure run (and also showing  
"tcltk" in the end output). Then compile and install R. Note that Aqua- 
based Tcl/Tk doesn't work properly with R, because they use a custom  
event loop that is incompatible with and other application (including  
R), so unless you are testing that, I'd recommend the X11 version  
(which is what we supply on CRAN).

Cheers,
Simon

Hi,
Did you ever get any response to your query?
I just started playing w/ R-Mac recently and noticed the same hangup 
with the Save dialog box.  I'm using R262 and OS X 10.4.11.

Query from a new user of R for Mac:  I saw the thread from last fall 
about <- vs =  in which someone mentioned that <alt><-> was a shortcut 
for <- .
Is there a list somewhere of all keystrokes or shortcuts built into the 
Mac interface?

Carl,

Which version of R.app (E.g. click on Abour R) are you using?

Exactly what did you do? Save history?

For the second instance, you open terminal and type

# open -n -a R.app

This only works on Leopard.

It is ok for the first instance also.  Moreover, one can specify an

open ~/r/project1 -n -a R.app

Dear R-Mac people,

If I build R (2.7.0) from source on a 64-bit Mac, will it be a 64-bit
app? I don't care about the GUI.........

If you use 64-bit compilers, yes. (FWIW the GUI in 2.7.0 compiles in  
64-bit, too).

Only if you specify '-arch x86_64'  My config.site is

CC="gcc -arch x86_64"
OBJC=$CC
F77="gfortran -arch x86_64"
FC=$F77

You probably want

./configure --with-blas='-framework vecLib' --with-lapack

for speed, and --with-aqua if you want to use the quartz() device (which 
unlike earlier versions is fine from the command line version of R).

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] NA handling  in 2.7.0 versus 2.6.2 for SD
Message-ID: <p06240809c433c3d19567@[192.168.1.101]>

Hi,
When comparing how R2.7.0 handles missing values  I discovered that 
it differs from 2.6.2 (at least for the sd function).   In 
particular, if a column of a matrix is all NA, sd in 2.7.0 throws an 
error while in 2.6.2 it just returns NA for that column.  Is this 
intentional?

I presume you mean sd(na.rm=TRUE): the default behaviour is unchanged.

This is intentional and documented in the NEWS file as a BUG FIX.

     o   co[rv](use = "complete.obs") now always gives an error if there
         are no complete cases: they used to give NA if
         method = "pearson" but an error for the other two methods.
         (Note that this is pretty arbitrary, but zero-length vectors
         always give an error so it is at least consistent.)

sd() calls var = cov.  Why would anyone expect

> sd(numeric(0))
Error in var(x, na.rm = na.rm) : 'x' is empty
> sd(NA_real_, na.rm=TRUE)
[1] NA
> sd(na.omit(NA_real_))
Error in var(as.vector(x), na.rm = na.rm) : 'x' is empty

(from 2.6.2)?

Yes, please see NEWS:

     o   co[rv](use = "complete.obs") now always gives an error if there
         are no complete cases: they used to give NA if
         method = "pearson" but an error for the other two methods.
         (Note that this is pretty arbitrary, but zero-length vectors

Also this is not Mac-specific so I wonder why ask here?

The compile and install seemed to go fine, but then I could not find
an executable. I expected it to be in /usr/local/bin. I looked also in
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/Current and found libraries
but no executable.

Any ideas?

Many thanks,

So, has the problem with 64 Mac builds failing "make check" due to the
system log10 function returning incorrect results?

See R for Mac FAQ 3 "Command line version of R".

Relative to where you built it it's
bin/R
and if you installed it as a framework then it's in
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/bin/R

Cheers,

delete your history (~/.Rhistory), that should allow you to use R.app  
again. It seems as if your history contains entries in in different  
encodings and hence fails to load (ungracefully). Fix should follow  
soon.

Hi Jarrett,

I was able to install the R-forge lme4 and Matrix
packages by invoking R from a Terminal window
(I used $ sudo R 
 so the process would have enough privileges
 to modify directories in the library)


  Dapple:~/Rtest stevenmckinney$ sudo R
  Password:

  R version 2.6.2 (2008-02-08)
  Copyright (C) 2008 The R Foundation for Statistical Computing
  ISBN 3-900051-07-0
 

I installed lme4 alright with the suggested command
from http://r-forge.r-project.org/R/?group_id=60

  
  > install.packages("lme4",repos="http://R-Forge.R-project.org")

  opened URL
  ==================================================
  downloaded 345 Kb


  The downloaded packages are in
          /tmp/Rtmpakk1fU/downloaded_packages

So lme4 installed alright.

Matrix choked for some reason.

  ==================================================
  downloaded 1.7 Mb

  Error: cannot remove prior installation of package 'Matrix'

This is what I was trying to avoid by running the process via 'sudo',
not sure what went wrong.

Installing from source worked:

Hey, all!  I'm trying to use the current version of lme4 over at http://R-Forge.R-project.org 
  but have been unable to do so thus far.  I get errors stating that  
it requires a i686 architecture or otherwise, and installing Matrix is  
a mess.  I have a G4 mac.

Has anyone here been able to install it on a non-intel mac?  If so,  
could you post instructions as to how?  Thanks!

Hrm.  Well, I just tried that, but got the following output

Warning in install.packages("lme4", repos = "http://R-Forge.R-project.org 
") :
   argument 'lib' is missing: using '/Users/jearbear/R/powerpc-apple-

Warning: unable to access index for repository http://R-Forge.R-project.org/bin/macosx/universal/contrib/2.7
Warning message:
package ?lme4? is not available


This might be a versioning issue (I installed 2.7 the other day -  
maybe I should go back!) but,  what is up with the argument lib being  
missing?  Odd...

I also had an odd error when installing Matrix from source

What's up with the cc1 error?

Suggestions?

Completely normal.   To read the help page for you (fortune(14) applies)

      'install.packages' can be used to install new packages/bundles. It
      takes a vector of names and a destination library, downloads the
      packages from the repositories and installs them.  (If the library
      is omitted it defaults to the first directory in '.libPaths()',
      with a warning if there is more than one.)

I think you need to install from the sources, as it seems R-forge does not 
have a suitable binary.

Update your Xcode (and I know that from past postings on this list).

Please update your Xcode. Xcode 2.4 or higher and gcc 4.0 is required  
if you are using R from CRAN. You can use any other compiler, but then  
you have to compile R from sources as you're using tools different  
from what we use on CRAN.

I'd recommend asking R-forge to fix their Mac OS X binary building  
process - their binaries don't seem to work properly.

Cheers,
Simon

Message-ID: <2C65004D-1DAA-48C6-A3B5-56ED7E4C9007@gmail.com>

Since installing new version (2.7.0) officially available from CRAN,  
I've been experiencing extreme slow-down when visualizing data in  
quartz device. If using same data with 2.6.2 branch everything works  
just fine. I have tried clean installs in both cases (defult settings  
for 2.6.2 and 2.7.0) with same results - quartz works flow less in  
2.6.2 and 2.7.0 is just much much slower. I just can't wait 10 sec to  
get one graph when I need to plot 10 other. For now I stick to older  
version but....

Is there anyone else with the same problem?

Could you post an example of a plot that is so much slower in 2.7?

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Can NOT print horizontal
Message-ID: <4814319F.6020601@yahoo.com>

This is a problem both on 2.6.2 and 2.7.0 for Mac.

When I try to print a quartz window drawing directly with the File/Print
command, it will only print vertical. Setting to print horizontal with
Page setup does not work.

One way to get around this is to save the .pdf file and print it with
Acrobat Reader. It's a pain.

Can this be fixed in the new revision?

Hi all,

I've the same problem + the resizing of the window is really really  
slow... for all datasets. I'm running leopard 10.5.2 and the latest  
macOS R dmg.

For all datasets. But when i use quartz() then plot, it seems ok (slow  
again but... usable). So right now, i use quartz(file, type="pdf")...

Best regards,

Charles

I found where is the problem, however have no solution for it right now.
To demonstrate (I have chosen 6000 to match my datasets size):

x=seq(1:6000)
y=rnorm(6000)
plot(x,y)

Absolutely no problem until now, everything is responsive, no lags.

Problem appears when I insert parameter 'type':

slowdown and unacceptable lag for "l", "o", "s"
plot(x,y, type="l")
plot(x,y, type="o")
...

however no problem at all  (instantly plotted) for "p", "b", "c", "h"
plot(x,y, type="p")
plot(x,y, type="b")
...

Does anyone know possible reason for this behaviour. Once again, I use  
clear install of R version 2.7.0 (2008-04-22). When I try the same  
stuff with latest 2.6.2 version everything runs smoothly without any  
problems.

Some versions of Windows GDI have a superficially identical problem -- 
stroking a path is quadratic in the number of segments.  The solution we 
used (in gdrawpolyline, in src/extra/graphapp/gdraw.c) was to split the 
drawing into pieces of length 1000, and that could be used here.  It would 
be a simple modification to RQuartz_Polyline and RQuartz_Polygon, so 
please try it and let us know how you get on.

It would also have been helpful to (C-level) profile the call and find out 
where the time is being spent -- I expect it not to be in R at all but in 
Quartz.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] [bug report] R.app GUI Color Configuration Dialog -
	Unable to change background color
Message-ID: <cea6642a0804261141x347c997dh7314898a64e5e1e8@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am new to using R and I have come across a behavior which might
possibly be a bug. Although it could just be my unfamiliarity with the
system.

I have installed version 2.7 of R on Apple iBook running OS X 10.5
(Leopard). I am using v1.24 (5102) of the R.app gui tool. I have been
trying to change the default background color for this tool (from
white to something else), but no matter what I try on closing the
color selection dialog, the background reverts to blue. The only other
color I have working for me is the default one - white background (set
using the default button).

I am not sure if I any additional steps are needed to change colors.
If so, I would appreciate directions (or pointers to directions) of
how to go about this. And if it is a bug, I'd be glad to provide any
additional information and/or testing to help resolve this issue.

Thanks for making available the gui.

Punit Agrawal

Please read what I actually asked you to do -- yes, I do know the code, 
but I asked you to change it following gdraw.c and test the change.

I understood it unfortunately that modification is supposed to be done  
in RQuartz_Polyline or RQuartz_Polygon.
Right now I am away from my computer so I'll check it tomorrow and let  
you know.
To alter anything in my case it takes some time, I'm quite new to C  
programing. However I give a try.
Thanks for patience.

Message-ID: <A8117E56-E172-4065-8EC7-D1BCF320B872@uni-freiburg.de>

Dear colleagues:

In all probability my request is trivial, please bear with me if so.  
Problem: installing packages (be it via the GUI or using  
"install.packages" meets with a response "can't access index of ...  
repository ..." (it's in German, but that's the gist). Since it works  
at home, I assume it's a firewall problem here in the Medical School.

I found documentation that a proxy can be defined like so:
Sys.setenv(http_proxy="http://USER:PASSWD at wwwp.ukl.uni-freiburg.de:80")
but that has no effect, even if I do it immediately after R's startup.
Possibly the reason is that that URL actually references a PAC file in  
my case.

Any help greatly appreciated! And thanks for a great GUI making R more  
approachable.


Best, Michael

Then that will not work -- basically your IT people are making life 
unnecessarily hard for you, and you should ask them for a solution.

Meanwhile, you could try installing wget and using 
options(download.file.method = "wget"): see ?download.file.  You will 
still have to setup wget to work with your proxy, and I suggest you ask 
your IT people to show you how.

Just a wild guess (not using 2.7.0): maybe there is some memory  
allocation going on Quartz-internally, and the block size has changed  
between Tiger and Leopard?

The following sample code from apple might be related, it shows and  
measures performance of 4 different ways of drawing lines: (1) as  
separate CGPaths, (2) as a single CGPath, (3) using the new bulk line  
drawing function in Tiger, and (4) by limiting the number of lines  
drawn: http://beta.devworld.apple.com/samplecode/QuartzLines/ 
QuartzLines.zip

In a nutshell,
(1) for() { CGContextBeginPath(); CGContextMoveToPoint();  
CGContextAddLineToPoint(); CGContextStrokePath(); }
(2) CGPathCreateMutable(); CGPathMoveToPoint(); for ()  
{ CGPathAddLineToPoint(); }
(3) /* construct point array in memory, then */  
CGContextStrokeLineSegments();
(4) as (3), but use fewer points. not quite as accurate due to  
undersampling

On my system, benchmark results are
(1) 28.1 ms (10000 lines, 356k lines/sec)
(2) 4.9 ms  (10000 lines, 2053k lines/sec)
(3) 4.0 ms  (10000 lines, 2484k lines/sec)
(4) 1.6 ms  (898 lines, 561k lines/sec)

The current approach used in RQuartz_Polylines, (1), seems to be  
slower than what can be achieved by, e.g., using (2) or (3).

Hi,

I've just installed R-2.7.0 on my mac, and all works well.  Would it
be worth adding a symlink to Rscript in /usr/bin, as is done
for R?  This would make the !# statements at the start of standalone
scripts nice and short (`/usr/bin/env Rscript' does not find
Rscript.)


Thanks for all the good work!

Stephen

That is not what RQuartz_Polylines uses. It uses calls from (1) but  
loop from (2). Interestingly, this is one of the fastest way:

(1) 82.6kl/s
(RQuartz) 1469kl/s
(2) 1138kl/s
(3) 1556kl/s
[iMac G5, 100k lines test modified from the sources above]

As you can see, the way we draw lines is just slightly slower than (3)  
which would require us to allocate extra space. Using a path is slower  
than what we use. Hence I'm not convinced that it is the issue.

However, I agree that Thomas' example is surprising to say the least  
(given the speeds above it should take fractions of a second). I'm  
running  some more tests to find out what causes it (the time is spent  
in CoreGraphics, but the question is why as there is no reason).

This is a paradox situation, because the new R Quartz device uses  
Quartz Extreme and GPU rendering, so especially things like drawing a  
line should be very fast ...

I'll keep you posted.

Cheers,
Simon

It would be interesting to know which machine Thomas is using. If it
were, say, an iBook it wouldn't be that surprising to learn that
Quartz Extreme was not working as well as one might hope and falling
back on a software renderer.

FYI, so folks don't go off in the wrong direction troubleshooting, I have
observed the same slowing on OS 10.4.11 using R 2.7.0, so the problem is not
limited to 10.5.

Tomas,

the issue should be addressed in R-2.7-patched now (by splitting the  
lines as suggested by Brian and using CGContextStrokeLineSegments).  
Please try tonight's build tomorrow (from http:// 
r.research.att.com/ ). That gives already a boost of several orders of  
magnitude.

Thanks to everyone involved,
Simon

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Can NOT switch working directory
Message-ID: <481688DF.7030108@yahoo.com>

I'm using R 2.7.0 on iMac G5 runing Mac OS 10.4.11.

On version 2.6.2, I can switch to a new working directory by using menu
command. However, since the new 2.7.0, this menu command ceased to work.
I have to type in the R console.

Can this be fixed?

Here is the info:

is R.app GUI 1.24-devel (4944)

And the same thing happened to me again today.  The "extra" Save dialog 
box (two of them in series) didn't respond to clicking on Save or Cancel 
until after I clicked on a couple other open R windows.

Previously...
Carl,

Which version of R.app (E.g. click on Abour R) are you using?

Exactly what did you do? Save history?

Regards,
Rob

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Slow Drawing Fix - is there now a different problem?
Message-ID: <C43D66CE.D539%hanson@depauw.edu>

Hey Folks, I?m rather tired tonight, but I think I?m really seeing what I?m
about to report. I was working on some plots (on the Quartz device), and ran
into what seemed to be discontinuities in what should have been nice smooth
plots.  Then, I tried the following:

> plot(c(1:100), c(1:100)) # plot of individual points looks OK
> plot(c(1:100), c(1:100), type = "l") # produces a line with breaks/gaps
> plot(c(1:100), c(1:100), type = "l", lty = 3) # dotted line with breaks/gaps

If instead I direct this to a pdf file with, e.g.,

> pdf("test.pdf")
> plot(c(1:100), c(1:100), type = "l", lty = 3)
> dev.off()

There are no gaps in the "line".

Am I just too tired to see what's going on here, or was a new problem
introduced along with the fix for the slow drawing problem in the patched R
2.7.0?

Thanks, Bryan

You need to update your tools.  Since you are using a binary version of 
R, you need the same (or later, I guess but cannot predict future 
versions) version of Xcode as that used to build R.  The FAQ at

http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/RMacOSX-FAQ.html#Additional-resources

says Xcode 2.4.1 is required

I know because this comes up on this list quite often, e.g. the thread 
starting at 
https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-mac/2008-April/004886.html last week.

Indeed, and just for completeness, from:
http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/RMacOSX-FAQ.html#How-to-install-packages

"5.3 Installation of source packages"
[...]
Important: When using binary R installation from CRAN, you must use  
Xcode 2.4.0 or higher (available from see Apple Developer Connection).  
Although R can be built using older tools, the way it is build depends  
on the version of the tools and therefore your must upgrade at least  
to the version of Xcode that the CRAN build uses.

Cheers,
Simon

Mea culpa, indeed, it was introduced by the fix (it was plotting only  
half the segments in each batch - blame Apple's documentation on  
that... :P). I have fixed that now (use SVN or wait for tonight's  
build).

Thanks,

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Tiny bug for chooseCRANmirror(graphics=TRUE) using a
	GUI list [select.list() issue]
Message-ID: <4C1BA277-B681-4A78-A496-75E24A0C6D25@eva.mpg.de>


Hi,

there is a very tiny bug if I invoke chooseCRANmirror(graphics=TRUE).
If I press 'Cancel' the following error message will be prompted:

Error in if (res > 0) { : argument is of length zero

due to the fact that the GUI function for 'menu' returns 'integer(0)'  
for canceling.
[Actually caused by select.list(). It returns character(0) and  
'match(character(0), c("a","b"), nomatch = 0)' returns integer(0)]

One could either write in the chooseCRANmirror function instead of:

if (res > 0) {

this:

if (length(res) && res>0) {


or change select.list() in such a way that it returns 0 for canceling,  
what should be the best way, I mean. The function 'menu' invoked by  
graphics=FALSE will be also canceled by typing 0.

This shouldn't interfere with other OSs. (On Windows it works)

MacOS 10.5.2 ppc; R 2.6.2 and R 2.7.0

Best,

--Hans

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] problem with X11() after install of 2.7.0.
Message-ID: <20080430143432.GA11438@marco.fz-rossendorf.de>

hi everybody,

today  I  decided  (unwisely,  it  appears) to install 2.7.0
under MacOS 10.4.7. now, when I  run  R  from  the  terminal
command line and do something like

plot(1:10)

a  X11 graphic window pops up, the 10 points are drawn on an
otherwise blank canvas (no axes, no labels, no  ticks  etc),
CPU  time  goes  to 100% and stays there and R does not come
back to the prompt ("hangs"). I tried to `ktrace'  this  but
this  produced a one Gig logfile in a few seconds from which
a learned nothing ...

a quick search of the  archive  did  not  yield  a  hit.  so
please: what's going on here?

thanks

joerg

Ancient system? As a very first step for your own good I'd recommend  
updating your system which is way out of date (the current version  
Tiger is 10.4.11). Then if the issue persists, please report your full  
sessionInfo() and machine used. The above works without problems on  
both 10.5.2 and 10.4.11 (Mac Pro and iMac).

Thanks,
Simon

thanks a lot for this "real time" response.

well, no. actually I _have_ 10.4.11 installed (I somehow was sure it's 10.4.7,
still. that's probably alzheimer casting his shadow :-)).

10.5.2 is no option for me since I need a working fullscreen X11 mode.
I now checked it again both on a dual 2Ghz G5 PPC and a 1.5 GHz power book PPC G4, 
both running
10.4.11: same problem. actually, R hangs only when really plotting. so
I can first open the device with X11() and get back to the R prompt. only
when executing the `plot(1:10)' R apparently hangs and everything is as described
in my first mail.

here comes the session info:

R version 2.7.0 (2008-04-22) 
powerpc-apple-darwin8.10.1 

locale:
C/de_DE.ISO8859-15/C/C/C/C

attached base packages:
[1] stats     graphics  grDevices utils     datasets  methods   base     

other attached packages:
[1] micropet_1.7.0 psflib_1.0     pkc_1.1        fzrutils_1.3   roiutils_1.3  

(identical on both machines).

any hint/help really appreciated.

regards,

joerg

I had the same (?) problem after upgrading to R 2.7.0 on a MacPro with
MacOS 10.5.2, using XQuartz 2.2.0.1 instead of Apple X11. I didn't try
to dig it as I decided to start using the quartz device (very good job)
instead.

The x11 device has no problem with tcltk though, and even with tkrplot.

thanks for this information. so at least there seems to be a
reall issue (though I'm still under Tiger  wit  Apple's  X11
and I don't see bus errors )

Hmm - I have tried even the PowerPC version now and it works without  
problems for me.
Are you using Apple's X11 or something else? Also do you get the error  
in the "regular" (non-root) mode?

Thanks,
Simon

Well that above doesn't say anything in that respect - the CRAN binary  
is meant to work with Apple's X11 only. If you use anything else,  
you're on your own and possibly have to compile your own version. For  
example if you have a different version of fontconfig it is enough to  
crash since fontconfig changed the internal format of the cache.

Cheers,
Simon

FWIW, we have a machine using XQuartz 2.2, and both my own build of R and
