Yes, I have symlinks like this in my library directories. I also have  
no idea how they got there .

I removed the symlinks, but haven't had a chance to see if it fixed my  
problem because I already updated all my out-of-date packages  
manually. Thanks for the tip!

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] tools for compiling R from source on Leopard
Message-ID: <74440450-D044-4A0B-BCDC-D7C94A1430C0@mit.edu>

Hi.  This week I received my very first Mac (I was previously a Linux  
user), and I am now trying to compile R from source.  I am running Mac  
OS 10.5.2, and I have downloaded and installed Xcode 3.0.  Following  
instructions on the R for Mac OS FAQ page I see that I need to install  
gfortran 4.2.1.  However, Xcode only comes with gcc 4.0.1, and I  
understand that the versions need to be the same.

The R for Mac tools site mentions that the Apple version for gcc 4.2.1  
is available from ADC, but I just cannot find it anywhere (I Googled,  
searched, etc, with no luck--can someone please point me in the right  
direction?).  So, I ran  the provided gcc42build5531.pkg installation  
file.  The installer ran with no errors, but it doesn't seem to  
install anywhere (I even created a test folder to install to, but  
after the installation, that folder was empty).   gcc --version still  
indicates that the version is 4.0.1.  The gfortran-42.pkg file  
installed correctly.

I know this sounds more like a Mac OS problem than an R problem, but  
since I am using tools (and following instructions) designed  
specifically for R, I thought I'd ask for help here.   I suppose that  
all I really need is to be able to effectively install either gcc  
4.2.1 (since I have the R-approved gfortran 4.2.1 installed) or an R- 
approved gfortran 4.0.1 (since I have gcc 4.0.1installed).

Either way, thanks in advance for any help you can offer.

G'day all,

I had this problem as well using the latest R2.6.2 from cran and  
trying to install RdbiPgSQL on 10.5.2 on MacBookPro

I was able to compile from sources, but I also noticed that it seemed  
to work the second time I tried for most packages.

This wasn't the case for Rdbi - but it did restore some of the ones  
that didn't work the first time, and not others... It seemed to depend  
on whether they were at head or older versions.

Sorry I can't offer much more help than this.

cheers

Ben

Michael,

the instructions you are referring to (gcc-4.2-based) are for  
experimental R builds using cutting-edge unreleased tools, so you're  
pretty much on your own there. So let me first address "offical" way  
as documented in the FAQ:
The gfortran compiler the FAQ refers to is on CRAN (http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools 
) - it is also the first download on the R for Mac Tools page. That is  
all you need (Xcode + the above Fortran) and both the FAQ and the  
tools page specifically say so.

Now to your quest for experimental, unsupported tools (see also  
comments inline below). The only reason to use gcc-4.2 is if you want  
to play with OpenMP. Note that the gcc-4.2 is known to have bugs, so  
tread with care.

That is not true (and I'm not sure why concluded it). Only the major  
version (3.x vs 4.x) has to match (as the FAQ tells you), so gcc 4.0.1  
+ gfortran 4.2.1 are just fine.

ADC: http://connect.apple.com/
Login, click on Downloads -> Developer Tools -> GCC 4.2 Developer  
Preview 1
If it's not there, please let me know.

Try typing
gcc-4.2

Which is expected - try enabling the installer log (Window->Installer  
Log) if you're interested in the details. If you're more comfortable  
with command-line tools and want to learn more about packages on OS X,  
have a look at "man pkgutil" and "man installer". For old-style  
packages (which are bundles) see also "man pax" and "man lsbom".

Yes, gcc is a link to gcc-4.0, not to gcc-4.2.

There is no problem, really ;).

No, that is wrong (see above). If you followed the instructions you'd  
use gcc 4.0.1 from Apple and gfortran 4.2.1 from CRAN. This is how the  
release is built.

FWIW: Although it is a nice exercise, I'm not quite sure why you want  
to build R from sources unless you want to modify it - note that your  
result is likely to be incompatible with the packages we create  
(unless you build the full multi-arch universal build).

One more side-note on the tools: now that you have installed several  
tools in your system (gcc 4.0, 4.2, two different gfortrans etc.), you  
should be aware that although you can use any combination of them, the  
library lookup is common to all, so unless you de-install the gfortran  
from /usr/local/bin (the CRAN verison) [via /usr/local/bin/gfortran- 
uninstall], even the binaries compiled with the Leopard gfotran (/usr/ 
bin/gfortran-4.2] will be linked to the /usr/local/lib/libgfortran  
dynamic library, because it has higher precedence than the static  
library that the system gfortran supplies. This is not really a  
problem as long as you are aware of it, but it that reduces the  
portability of your binaries a bit (you'll have to ship the gfortran  
shared library with your binaries if they use Fortran). If you don't  
understand what I'm saying, don't worry too much :) it doesn't affect  
anything as long as you stay on the same machine.

Cheers,
Simon

Simon:

Thanks for clarifying all of this.  The statement in section 2.1.2 of  
the MacOS FAQ is what threw me off a bit (I thought when matching 3.x  
and 4.x, the x had to match as well.  My mistake).  Certainly, I don't  
need to be using experimental, unsupported tools.  Again, I probably  
just read way too much into the instructions.

  But I do want to be sure that I have a 64-bit build of R  that  is  
linked to the vecLib BLAS (similar to my current configuration on  
Linux).  Is there a way to do this without compiling from source?  I  
see there are instructions on the R for MacOS developer page, but  
these are also flagged as "experimental."  If I don't want to be too  
experimental, I'm not sure how to get to where I want to go otherwise.

Thanks,

Michael

Normally you can get 64-bit build from
http://r.research.att.com/
but right now the x86_64 build doesn't pass make check, so it's  
officially not available for download. The problem is a bug in the  
gcc-4.2 compiler that miscompiles some code.

Anyway, if you feel like it, you can try either
http://r.research.att.com/R-devel-leopard-universal.tar.gz
or
http://r.research.att.com/R-2.6-branch-leopard-universal.tar.gz

The latter is a 2.6-branch so it's a bit less experimental.
To install, just unpack to root,e.g.
sudo tar fxz R-devel-leopard-universal.tar.gz -C /

Let me know if that works for you.

As of vecLib - that's really easy - you can always symlink the vecLib  
framework as libRblas.dylib, but all CRAN builds use vecLib anyway.

Cheers,
Simon

Simon:

Thanks, I'll try the research.att.com builds.  That's a lot easier  
than what I was trying to do.

I appreciate your help, and all of the work you do to make R happen.

Message-ID: <1204555998.47cc10de6ef11@webmail.noc.soton.ac.uk>

I have a problem installing R 2.6.6 on my macbook running 10.5.2

I run the installer in the usual way. It gets almost to the end and then I get 
the error message:-

The Installer could not install some files in ?/?. Contact the software 
manufacturer for assistance. 

This is repeated in the console with no more information.

Any idea what is going on and how to solve it?

I am an administrator so I should not have permission problems and I have 
installed older versions of R with no problem.

I have tried repairing file permissions and that doesn't help.

cheers

I get the error message

Warning: unable to access index for repository 
http://www.sourcekeg.co.uk/cran/bin/macosx/universal/contrib/2.6

when I try to update my list of R packages using Get List within the 
R Package Installer. Trying to access that URL gives an Internal 
Server Error. It happens on both my home and work machines, which 
makes me think it's a server problem rather than mine.

Curiously, when I email mirrors at sourcekeg.co.uk to report it, I get 
an error message saying the mailbox doesn't exist.

I've just started using R 2.62 on OSX 10.4.11 on a macbook 2,1 and
found that in the Editor on Windows ctrl-R runs the current line and
goes to the next line. On Mac cmd-return runs the current line and
stays there. Shouldn't the cursor go to the next line, so a program
can be run stepwise with multiple cmd-rtn instead of cmd-rtn
down-arrow?

Is there a search option in the web archive? I couldn't find it.

Tim,
can you, please, post this to the cran mailing list? This is not  
really Mac related, it is a CRAN mirror issue.
Thanks,

It was not designed to do so, but clearly it could be changed,  I'm  
not sure it's good idea, though, as it combines an action (execute a  
line) with a change of selection and that is usually not desirable (I  
know that WIndows is known to breach UI design principles all over the  
place, but that's another story). Most commonly one uses selection to  
select the program/function that will be run instead and you don't  
want to change the position there. Any comments on this from other  
users?

In Windows the mental image is that there are two functions attached to 
Ctrl-R:

  - if something is selected, then submit it.
  - if not, then single step through the script.

The second function is what Rune is asking about.  I'd say it's good to 
have a "single step" function on a key.  It doesn't need to be the same 
key as "submit the selection", but it doesn't seem to lead to confusion 
if it is.

On a Mac in the Xcode debugger, what's the key for single stepping?  (My 
Mac is at home, I can't check.)  It would make a lot of sense to use 
that key for single stepping in the script editor too.

Some similar sort of functionality would be great - I have used both,  
and found it was a logical sort of approach.

Hi all
I have been seeing some issues with R 2.6 (both 1 & 2) that when I  
normalize data using rma() or justRMA(), the data is transposed i.e.  
probes are columns and samples are rows. Currently I am transposing  
my data, but this does cause inconvenieces in analyzing data further  
with our normal routines.
Can this be fixed?

Wrong list - R-SIG-Mac is about Mac related questions concerning R (as  
the name says). Your question has nothing to do with R itself or with  
Macs. Try BioC help lists since you're talking about 3rd party (BioC)  
contributed packages below.

I can see the benefit of single stepping in some cases, but I 
wouldn't want to lose the current behaviour.

Whiile on the subject, cmd-return has an odd feature. Once a line has 
been submitted using cmd-return, it needs two returns not one to move 
from the end of the line to the next. I suspect this is not intended 
- can it be changed?

Thanks,

In Aquamacs, I most often use C-c C-n; this submits a line and step  
to next. I like it because I can keep my left pinkie finger on the  
Crtl key to execute it. (I am not much of a typist).

This is actually a feature of ESS (http://ess.r-project.org),  
available for all flavors of Emacs.

For me, this is also the "way to go". And for submitting without  
stepping to the next command, there's always C-c C-j.

You can compile R for the iPhone for quite a while now, it's just of  
limited use, because you don't have a GUI (unless you're willing to  
use MobileTerminal ;)). For now there are no plans to write a UIKit- 
based GUI if that was your question.

Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.58.0803080628010.2619@capecod.bwh.harvard.edu>

I just taught a course based on R-2.7.0dev, where many bioconductor and CRAN
packages were required.  For the windows students, I take my
loaded R-2.7.0dev folder, in which all needed packages have been installed,
zip it, and have them unzip it in some specified location so that
there are no conflicts with existing installations.  A shortcut is set
to the new Rgui.exe, given a name that distinguishes it from existing
distributions, and this is used for the course.

Can a similar process be conducted with a MacOSX distro?  The desiderata
are that a single decompression step yields an image of R with all
desired packages, and a distinguishable icon is made available so that
the course-specific GUI is selectable from doc or finder.

I posted without much thought after I watched the exciting SDK release

I used to have a Palm device with some statistics and graphics  
functionality that I liked. It obviously did not have anything more in  
it in terms of features other than descriptive statistics, basic  
inferential statistics, and plots, not more than covered in an

Yes.
There are several ways to achieve this with various levels of  
complexity:

1) Compile R with FW_VERSION=2.7-VC (or any other identifier),  
install, and compile the GUI. This guarantees a unique name that won't  
conflict with any other R installation.

2) Use R-devel from CRAN. This is easier as 1) since you don't need to  
compile anything, but by definition it will conflict with any other R- 
devel CRAN framework (or 2.7.x to be precise).

3) Use any binary and use install_name_tool to relocate it. All  
installed frameworks are linked with full paths to libraries.  
install_name_tool allows you to change those such that you can move  
the binaries anywhere.

4) Use non-framework version of R. Those are relocatable, but require  
a start script to set DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH to $R_HOME/lib. Although this  
allows you essentially to create one "R" icon containing the entire R  
(which can be place anywhere, even run from an image), care must be  
taken when compiling the GUI since there is no framework. Also it may  
be necessary to set DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH in the GUI.

1) and 2) use the regular framework location (/Library/Framerworks/ 
R.framework) such that the version to use can be selected using  
RSwitch. Note that the GUI starts always the version it was compiled  
for regardless of the RSwitch setting. Therefore by removing the  
"R.framework/Versions/Current" link before packaging you can make sure  
that the existing version is not touched.

On a Mac, I'd recommend a bit different approach that makes it easier  
for you: just get the regular R-devel from CRAN (e.g. in the  
tar.gzipped form to not have to worry about Apple's Installer  
upgrading the existing R) and archive only the packages. You can  
unpack them anywhere, just set R_LIBS or .libPaths() to the correct  
path.

I hope it helps. Let me know if you have questions about the details.

Cheers,
Simon

Following the point brought up by Vince Carey, I thought I'll share  
some info how you can create a version of R that is fully contained in  
the R.app bundle. i.e. all you have is just the "R" icon that can be  
moved/copied anywhere.

Prerequisities:
- Mac OS X 10.4 or higher
- Xcode developer tools installed (see R for Mac FAQ)
- somewhat recent, working R.app + R framework (e.g. from CRAN) in  
default locations

For simplicity I assume that you'll be assembling the R on your  
Desktop and you are using regular CRAN binary, but you can do that  
anywhere with any R.

copy/paste in Terminal (I hope your mailer doesn't wrap this):

cd ~/Desktop
# copy R.app
ditto /Applications/R.app R.app
cd R.app/Contents
# copy the R.framework inside
mkdir Frameworks
ditto /Library/Frameworks/R.framework R.framework

# fix all executables and libraries
for f in `find . \( -perm +a+x -a -type f \)`; do
if otool -L $f 2>/dev/null|grep Versions/.../Resources/lib >/dev/null  
2>&1; then
libs=`otool -L $f 2>/dev/null|sed -n 's:.*\(/Library/Frameworks/ 
R.framework/Versions.*\) (.*:\1:p'`
for lib in $libs; do
nlib=`echo $lib|sed 's:/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/ 
Versions/...:@executable_path/../Frameworks/R.framework:'`
echo $f:$lib
install_name_tool -change $lib $nlib $f
done
fi
done

Now you have a fully working R.app on your desktop that you can copy  
anywhere and it is self-contained. All paths are relative to the  
executable, hence relative to R.app.

[Note: in order to test the fact that it is relocatable, you have to  
move/rename/delete /Library/Frameworks/R.framework first, otherwise  
rogue packages might fall back to that]

CAVEAT: There is a caveat, though: you *cannot* install any packages  
with such R. Installing source package is a no-no (they won't compile)  
and installing binary packages will only work if you fix them before  
use (i.e. cd into R.app/Contents and re-run the script above starting  
with "for f...")
[Another caveat is that the command-line version of such R won't work,  
but that is expected, because the R start script contains hard-coded  
R_HOME path, so you'd have to fix that whenever you move R.app.]

Therefore you should install all necessary packages (in the system- 
wide location) *before* you package it.

This is indented for those who wish to carry R with them on a USB  
stick temporarily and/or give a specifically setup version of R to  
others (class/workshop ...). It is not intended for "regular" use and  
is not officially supported. Use at your own risk ;).

Hint: to create a compressed disk image of this R such that you can  
use it without installing, run
cd ~/Desktop
mkdir R
mv R.app R
hdiutil create -srcfolder R R.dmg

Cheers,
Simon

For advanced users: you can also use install_name_tool -id to change  
the IDs of libraries in $R_HOME/lib. If you do that to your system R,  
all compiled packages will be correctly linked so you don't need the  
fixup anymore.

This is a very nice entry to the faq. Thanks Simon.

btw, wouldn't it be possible to create a small app (with an embedded  
script) to do this?
Which possibly makes a copy of R.app, so if you discover you need a  
additional package, you  install it in the original R.app and repackage.

p.s. I'm not volunteering though :)

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] OSX R Gui Data editor
Message-ID: <47D595D4.1030309@uchsc.edu>

G'day

I just tried to introduce a naive user to R via doing a t-test on her
data using Rcmdr on OS X. Now I'm not sure if this is the right mailing
list but I must say that  the introduction was a complete and total
failure because of the OSX data editor that is called by Rcmdr. I think
this is the one that comes with the R GUI. We tried to enter her data
into R and I couldn't do it using the OS X data editor. When I had to go
to the command line she was clearly initialy put off by the poor editor
and by the need for the command line to fix it.  As she said, "how can I
trust a stats program with my important data if they can't get data
entry working?". She promptly went back to Instat

I know that the criticism she voiced isn't valid and that some learning
is required for any program, but I think she has a point. The data
editor as it stands is a failure. The idea that you can add a column but
not change the variable name and that you have to double click on each
cell to enter data is crazy. It is simply a pretty looking window with
less functionality than the old x11 interface.

I'm aware that the current model is "prepare your data elsewhere and
import it into R" but this is an absurd stance. It works for large data
sets that statistical experts deal with but then the  casual t-test
requires several programs and an import step. A silly approach
especially when the data sets are small (about 10-20 entries) and all
the user wants to do is a simple t-test.

If braoder adoption of R is an aim then the OS X data editor needs to be
at least as functional as the X11 one. The ability to double click to
change variable names and right click to change the variable type (or
menu entries to do this) is important if not essential. The ability to
tab to the next data entry slot is also a simple but important function
that needs to be included.  Right now it is a barrier to new OS X users
who want to try out R using a simple t-test on a small data set.

John,

I think you may be mixing up the R package Rcmdr [^1] with the Mac OS
X R gui.  I've haven't used Rcmdr in years so I cannot comment on your
issue, but I think you were commenting on the Mac gui.

Yes, I agree that the edit() function leaves a bit to be desired and
using it as the primary data entry point would be painful.  Your
suggestions for improvement would make it more user friendly.
However, the gui currently implements the edit.data.frame() function
which is a part of R (as opposed to the gui) and thus works on other
platforms, it appears to allow editing of row names, but not column
names.  I don't believe it has ever been intended as the primary means
of getting data into R.  It is, however, useful for fixing the
occasional incorrect value in a dataframe.

Perhaps what you are looking for is something along the lines of the
xlsReadWrite package, which purports to read and write Excel files
(though having excel save as csv usually works for me).

If your colleague isn't interesting in learning to use a command line
program, then I suspect that R is not the correct choice for her.
Developing guis is a lot of work, and actually I think that the Mac R
gui is impressive and quite nice to work in compared to the windows
gui.

Lastly, please keep in mind that R is an open source project.  The
people who develop have kindly license their work so that we can all,
use it, learn from it, and improve it to match our needs if we desire.

Peter

Your colleague's reaction is completely correct. If all you need to do
is hand enter 20 data points and run a t-test then even Instat is
probably overkill and R is definitely overkill. Hell, I'm pretty sure
the last graphing calculator I owned could do various sorts of
t-tests. The ones kids have these days can probably do glm.

R is mostly aimed at people whose data is already in electronic form
so the data entry mechanisms simply don't get used very much
(certainly not by me, the idea of hand entering data mostly strikes me
as a good way to introduce errors). Think of R like a big industrial
CNC mill or something. It's big, clunky and kind of a pain, but if you
need to make a set of intricate wheel rims to very high tolerances
there is nothing on this earth that can match it. However, not so
great for paper snowflakes, unless you've been using it forever in
which case its mostly out of habit... and you've lost your scissors.

Now, would it be nice if there was a full-blown spreadsheet interface
built into R? Hell, yes. But, unless someone is volunteering to write
it, I'm more likely to discover that my alarm clock is made of pound
cake.

I think this notion that data entry and data analysis should happen
"in the same place" arises from two different things, one cultural and
one practical. The cultural reason is the rise of the spatial
programming language in the form of the spreadsheet, which encourages
the conflating of the data entry and the analysis phase through the
spatial environment. The second is the practical fact that there's no
such thing as an efficient data interchange format aside from,
perhaps, ye olde delimited table. Take a look at InStat (it's a
GraphPad thing for those who don't know), since it was the software
originally mentioned, you can important a couple of different
delimited text files, but you couldn't talk to a database even if you
wanted to and there's a pretty harsh limit on the size of data that
can be processed (1000x26 seems awfully arbitrary in this day and age,
but so it goes).

Message-ID: <47D6B700.8070508@uchsc.edu>

Thank you for the responses to my email. I'd like to further the
discussion a little because I think it may be productive.

I'll take major points from the responses and deal with them one by one
although not necessarily in order.

With regard to my colleague's willingness to learn a command line
program. She is an extremely intelligent person and has learned Latex to
typeset her documents - no question she is able to learn. But she
requires some evidence that the program is worth learning. To her mind
and to mine, simple things should be simple to do and complex things
made easier by any software. My point here is that entering in data via
the data editor failed. Whether or not that is the best way or the right
way is irrelevant. R offers an option to enter small data sets via an
editor - the edit function. In the X11 interface and the Windows
interface to the edit function, the functionality is present. In the mac
editor it is not. I agree that the GUI interface to the command line is
nice and functional and the programmers are to be applauded. The fact
remains that the data editor in the Mac interface is inadequate.  When
someone tries a program for the first time and a simple function fails
then there is no incentive to go further.


As regards the best way to enter data.  I think statisticians are used
to investigators coming to them with very precious post processed data.
Consequently data entry is handled using programs that emphasize data
integrity, security and organisation. Hence the use of Excel (sic!!!) to
handle data for export to R.

In reality in lab work, data abounds. The scientist  performs ad hoc
experiments daily and tries to see what is going on. Sometimes, as in
this case, he/she wants to find out if a rough <preliminary> experiment
is showing a difference. For the scientist, the ability to enter data
quickly and see if the difference they think they are seeing is real
<is> important. When the experiments have settled into a routine and
data collection becomes part of a protocol, the data should and does go
into a data entry program ( a database with data entry front end or a
spreadsheet). That is the data the statistician sees and has been
collected with great care and expense, but it is not the only kind of
data the scientist deals with

Yes the t-test could be done on a calculator, but few scientists in the
biomedical sciences actually use a calculator for a t-test. They all use
a computer based stats program. To my mind, if they do it in R, two
things are accomplished; a broader adoption of R and the preliminary
data are in R to be added to and if difficulties arise to be handed to
an analyst who also uses R. (Please don't go off topic and tell me they
should have seen a statistician before starting; a.) I know the reasons
and b.) it isn't always necessary)

Mathematical statisticians regard data as holy. Scientists who collect
the data know it to be dirty, unkempt and often scribbled on pieces of
paper or on the margins of notebooks -especially when the experiments
are just getting started. Not all data are important. Many experiments
simply confirm that there is no difference due to a treatment. The
ability to quickly enter small data sets and check to see if there
really is a difference is important to investigators. Fisher knew that,
so did Student/Gosset hence the development of small sample statistics.
I'm suggesting that if 'R' wants to address the needs of scientists, a
method for entry of small data sets is important. The command line is
fine. I use it and I am happy with it. But R <offers> a data editor.
Those who want to use it should be able to. This does not mean a full
blown spreadsheet interface. I agree that would be stupid. All I am
suggesting is that the Mac data editor be functional. The Unix and
Windows ones already are.

So, is this an offer to contribute an improved data editor to the OS X
GUI? We could certainly use one, it would be much appreciated.

Thanks, Rob.

In the interests of wasting many hours to save a few seconds of hateful
clicking around,
I have written an applescript solution for saving the history.
It works (most of the time).
Why I want it:  (a) automate my paranoia,  (b) sometimes, to load
current history into a script window
to refine and save some juicy section of code.
(The latter can be done with loadHistory(file.choose()) followed by
history().)

The applescript below assumes 
	--	1.  there is a file "~/cred.Rdata" that contains
username and password as string objects (could be safer!)
			(This is not necessary if you always have
Universal Access turned on.)
	--  	2.  there is the following function on your search path:

	saveHistory=function(verbose=FALSE, echo=FALSE) {
		if(is.na(match("file:~/cred.Rdata", search())))
			attach("~/cred.Rdata")
		if(verbose == FALSE)verbose = "false"   ## arg in 
		else	verbose = "true"
		the.command = paste(
			"nohup /usr/bin/osascript
~/R-applescript/saveHistory.app ",  
			Sys.Date(), ".history ", username, " ",
password, " ", verbose, " &\n", sep="")
		## the "nohup" helps a lot
		if(echo) cat(the.command)
		system(the.command)
	}

	--   	3.  	you prefer "universal access" to be disabled
after this is done (this is easy to change).
	--	4. 	there is a compiled applescript file
~/R-applescript/saveHistory.app containing the following: 

on run {historyfilename, myUserName, myPassword, verbose}
	-- TO DO handle the "replace existing" case (but maybe it's
better this way!)
	-- TO DO figure out why it is so SLOOOW-- much better if no
"say"s.  (verbose=false)
	-- TO DO sometimes the accessibility fix doesn't work even
though .AccessibilityAPIEnabled was created .
	--       If so, set it by hand, using System
Preferences/Universal Access.
	my enableAccessibility(myUserName, myPassword 
	if (verbose = true) then say "this is the app version"
	tell application "System Events"
		tell process "R.app"
			if not (exists drawer 1 of window "R Console")
then
				if (verbose = true) then say "beginning
to open the drawer"
				click button "History" of tool bar 1 of
window "R Console"
				if (verbose = true) then say "opening
the drawer"
				-- delay 1
			end if
			if (verbose = true) then say "Now I am clicking
the Save History button"
			click button "Save History" of drawer 1 of
window "R Console"
			if (verbose = true) then say "Clicked."
			tell window "Save history File"
				if (verbose = true) then say "history
file name is " & historyfilename
				--click text field 1
				set value of text field 1 to
historyfilename
				--  item 1 of argv is just the first
letter
				if (verbose = true) then say "file name
is inserted"
				-- It's necessary to enable the Save
button by clicking the dropdown button.
				-- click text field 1  does not do the
job.  Therefore...
				if title of button 3 = "Cancel" then
					-- file list is expanded-- hide
it!
					click button 4
				else
					-- file list is hidden-- expand
it!
					click button 3
				end if
				click button "Save"
				-- An overwrite dialog might now appear.
				-- This is left for user interaction.
			end tell
		end tell
	end tell
	my disableAccessibility(myUserName, myPassword)
end run

on enableAccessibility(myUserName, myPassword)
	do shell script "echo a >
/private/var/db/.AccessibilityAPIEnabled" user name myUserName password
myPassword with administrator privileges
end enableAccessibility

Right now, there isn't in R.app.

The history file is updated on exiting R, which is clearly of no use to
you. The updated history file can be read by both R and R.app, this is
the interoperable part.

If I recall correctly (it has been a few years!), to do what you need,
would require a call back from R. I seem to remember this would not be
hard to do but at that time was not available. Don't think it is today
either.

A possible approach is to run long interactive sessions from within the
editor. Add a couple of statements and submit selection to R. If you're
using the internal editor, save the file before submitting. From within
an external editor, saving is less critical.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Installing Updated R does not update version info
Message-ID: <653CDA49-B51C-4AA3-892E-26D3A6D00A1F@utoronto.ca>

This is about the updated R GUI (R-GUI-4944-2.6-Deployment), released  
in February 2008.

Installing the updated GUI version of R 2.6.2 causes the version  
number to revert to that of the older version. This may not be a big  
problem from the perspective of function, but it could cause confusion  
when people are checking version numbers for R.

I always check the version number (displayed in the "info" window of  
the application icon) when I upgrade to verify that upgrading was  
successful. Before moving the updated R to the Applications directory,  
info says its version is: 1.24-devel (4944). But after moving updated  
R to Applications, info says the version is: 1.23 (4932), which is the  
version shown for the older (non-updated) R 2.6.2. Note that I had  
moved the older version to the Documents dir prior to moving the  
updated version to Applications.

Here's the kicker: when I run the updated R and examine "About R", it  
says that the version is 1.24-devel (4944). Yet, the info box still  
claims it is version 1.23!

Maybe someone should fix? Or is it supposed to do that?

By mistake I typed:

.3*4 /

to which R responded with +
but when I hit Esc, it then needs to be forced to quit.
(I've tried this several times).

(This does not happen on a PC -- it recovers just fine).

Please update to the latest GUI version from CRAN, this has been fixed  
a while ago (and posted here many times..).

Just out of curiosity - when and how did you install your R? The buggy  
version has been on CRAN only for 5 days, so one would think that  
chances of having it would be very low by now...

Thanks,
Simon

Simon and other.

Sorry. Obviously I need to update more than once a week, and I must  
have missed the discussion
about the bug with all the recent talk about data editors and gui's.

Apologies. I'll try to be more proactive with my downloads.

Michael,

I suspect you are just looking at the wrong info box - remember that  
moved and deleted files are still kept in the system - look at the  
"Where" field to make sure you are looking at what you think you are  
looking. I get always "R GUI 1.24-devel" in the short info and "R.app  
GUI 1.24-devel (4944), ..." in the "Version" field on the updated  
R.app, regardless where I copy it. When you look at the files in the  
image, there is nowhere "1.23" to be found at all, so it is not an  
issue with the update (and I'm pretty sure about it, because Finder  
uses the same file that the R.app does for showing the version).

Cheers,
Simon

Have you opened a new one? Finder doesn't update the info box when the

Maybe there is a better way, but I just duplicate the R app and then  
double click on each one.

Don't forget you can run R from Terminal. So there you can have any
number of Terminal windows open, each with its own R. You can even open
a quartz device (although non-interactive). You can also run it under
X-windows (from xterm for example) and there you have an x11 device.

Just to expand a little on David's answer...

In the last few days I have been running four or five simulations  
simultaneously on a Mac Pro by starting them from the command line.  
The code for the simulation is in a file foo.R and it is run from  
Terminal with

	$ R CMD BATCH foo.R &

Issuing a similar command multiple times results in multiple parallel  
instances of R to run.

For nice R graphics on OS X, use the quartz device with the CarbonEL  
package. I have in my ~/.Rprofile file:

	library("graphics")
	library("CarbonEL")
	options(repos = "http://cran.ca.r-project.org", menu.graphics =  
FALSE, device = "quartz")

As an aside, if you frequently want to run multiple instances of R  
(e.g. to work on different projects), I would recommend using R from  
within Emacs with ESS; see

	http://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html#R-and-Emacs

On OS X, I use Aquamacs (http://aquamacs.org) which comes bundled with  
ESS. No setup necessary!

[I know, this is more of a Unix than Mac-like approach...]

Hope this helps!

Christina,

Tiger does not have 64-bit X11, so you either have to disable X11  
support (--without-x) or install 64-bit version of X11 from somewhere.  
If you use the (rather old) R-25-br binary, then it expects X11 to be  
in /usr/local/X11R7 (you can download it at you own risk from
http://r.research.att.com/Xorg-quad.tar.gz
I didn't test it recently but it is the full client including headers  
etc. for all four architectures

Cheers,
Simon

The Max (OS X) is a great Unix box.  Some things are best
done on RGui, and some (more, the way I see it) on the Unix side.
There are less than 10 ESS commands one really wants, maybe

ESC-x R                     (start an R process)
                                      (if required do it again &  
again, but Xple
                                       processes can breed confusion!)
ESC-x ess-rdired      (get a list of objects in the workspace, mark
                                        d or D for delete, u to undo,  
and x to execute)
                                       (This is a truly great feature.)
C-c C-d   (dump obj or function into an edit buffer)
C-c C-l    (load from edit buffer back into R)

C-c C-n  (feed lines one at a time from a .R buffer into R)

C-x 4f     (emacs command to load file into a split of the current  
window)
C-x 5f     (emacs command to load file into a new window)

Plus, there are the emacs commands that search back through the
buffer.

There are a few others that I use infrequently.  Also, some of these
can be done from the menu.

Mac users should consider using emacs and ESS, sticking, until greater
adventure calls, to just a small subset of its features.

Why are you using R-2.5, when you try to compile R-2.6.2 from source?  
This seems to indicate that you do not really need an older version...  
Without being sure I would think that if you use 2.6.2 on Tiger you  
can use CarbonEL to get 64bit display quartz device functioning from  
the command line.

Did you install 64-bit GTK+ in the first place? A package won't give  
any errors at compile time if you don't have 64-bit binary of a  
certain library, because it is hoping to resolve dependencies at run  
time. I don't have 64-bit GTK+ (and I don't even know whether you can  
get one), so you're entirely on your own. Beware that GTK+ is an  
extreme pain to build - one of the many reasons is that they hard-code  
machine-specific information in the headers thus preventing a native  
"fat" build.

Cheers,
Simon

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] FreeType on osx
Message-ID: <47DC07A2.8090808@stats.uwo.ca>

I'm trying to add FreeType support to rgl.  I see that there are 
versions that ship with OSX, and also versions on DarwinPorts and fink. 
  What would be the recommended advice to users on this, and what would 
a configure script need in order to find FreeType?

On Linux, looking for freetype-config works, but that's not working on 
my OSX 10.4 laptop.  Would it work in Leopard out of the box, or does a 
user need to install FreeType explicitly?

FreeType is a bit of a pain (I'll elaborate on that below). For CRAN  
binaries of packages that use FreeType we use a static build instead  
of the system one because those are too old. From a package's point of  
view it's easy, though, because you only have to ask pkgconfig or  
freetype-config. I wouldn't bother doing anything Mac-specific,  
because both Tiger and Leopard have freetype-config, but their  
versions are too old or buggy to bother.

It should - do you have X11 on your PATH?

Sort of - X11 in Leopard is broken out of the box, so you have to fix  
that first, but once you do, it works. Both Tiger and Leopard come  
with FreeType.

The real problem is that FreeType (even the last release) is somewhat  
broken on OS X. It doesn't support system fonts properly. The CVS  
version is a bit better, but still has a bug that causes font styles  
to be mixed up. In addition, it is incompatible with the one shipped  
in the OS. But anyhow, I don't think you should worry about all this  
as a package maintainer - I'll have to sort those things out anyway  
now that we use FreeType in R :).

Cheers,
Simon

Do anyone have experience using the intel compilers and the MLK  
library with R? If so, what is the speedup approximately (I know this  
depends heavily on what task you are doing, but I am just looking for  
some general impressions).

The results will also depend on the CPU and the version of the Intel 
compilers, but generally differences between compilers are a few percent, 
and fast math libraries even less.  One exception is an accelerated BLAS 
on some intensive matrix algebra tasks, especially where multiple CPUs or 
cores are available 'for free'.

I've not tried on MacOS, because the experience on Linux has not been 
good. i386 Intel compilers have consistently generated wrong code at high 
optimization levels (to the point that 'make check' fails) and whereas 
x86_64 versions work correctly, they seem rarely to generate code as fast 
as gcc.  As an accelerated BLAS, MKL seems uncompetitive with ATLAS or 
Goto (especially on dual core chips).

The chip also matters, and recent experience on an Intel Core 2 Duo has 
been better than in the past on Xeons.  But my home PC has a very simlar 
Core 2 Duo to my iMac, and that's the main basis for the previous para.

I remember a couple of reports from Jan de Leeuw of incorrect results on 
early Intel Macs, which were traced to use of Intel i386 compilers.

Gcc/gfortran does a good job, especially if you turn the optimization 
levels up -- using -O3 gains ca 10% on x86_64 Linux.  I've also got 
SunStudio compilers there and on Solaris, and despite their excellent 
reputation the speed gains are small (although they are very useful in

Thanks, it was the lack of X11 in the path that was the problem for 
detection, but now I'm seeing some bad glyphs.
I'm using FTGL as a wrapper for Freetype, so the problem might be there, 
or it might be the broken Freetype.

I've seen that, and in all cases it was to do with which font freetype was 
told to use.

You could try to make sure that the Apple TrueType fonts (what Simon is 
calling 'system fonts') are used -- it seems that almost everything else 
gets used incorrectly on MacOS.  I'm not sure FTGL has support for those 
-- its demo hardcodes paths to .ttf fonts, for MacOS in a user area.

Finding suitable fonts is probably also a concern on Linux and other 
Unix-alikes.  There are some free ttf fonts available that you could ship: 
they are not as nice as the Apple ones, but they would provide a good 
platform-independent default.  (E.g. Liberation, mentioned in 
R-admin.texi.)  If you want a symbol font, you are going to be out of luck 
-- the only symbol fonts I know of are the Apple and Windows ones, and 
freetype does not use the Windows one correctly (or at least, no 
freetype-based program I have tried does, and it seems to do with the 
encoding).

I've taken three from the Amaya project (FreeMono, FreeSans, and 
FreeSerif).  They also have some symbol fonts ESSTIX*, with a non-GPL 
compatible license; I haven't seen how good they are.  Amaya also has 
bold, italic and bold-italic versions of the basic fonts, but I've only 
taken the regular ones, to avoid a huge increase in the rgl file size.

I see the same problem using /System/Library/Fonts/times.dfont.  It 
looks as though FTGL or FreeType is building a bitmap, then misapplies 
the dimensions:  some of the characters are fine, others end up really 
slanted (sometimes wrapped) within a rectangular box.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac]  X11 problem after migration to Leopard
Message-ID: <47CDCF10-ACA9-4E40-B064-08BD9F383B6A@farmbio.uu.se>

Hi,

After migrating to Leopard I have problems with X11 when sunning R  
from the command line (which I prefer). I acknowledge that this most  
likely is not an R issue, but I thought that somebody else on this  
list might have had the same problem and has a nice solution to offer...

When trying to plot something in R from the command line (it works  
however from the R GUI) I get the following error message:

===========================================
Error in X11() :
   could not find any X11 fonts
Check that the Font Path is correct.
In addition: Warning messages:
1: In X11() :
   locale not supported by Xlib: some X ops will operate in C locale
2: In X11() : X cannot set locale modifiers
===========================================

So, it seems like R cannot find the fonts. Issuing xset -q in the  
terminal generates the following output:

===========================================
Keyboard Control:
   auto repeat:  on    key click percent:  0    LED mask:  00000000
   auto repeat delay:  660    repeat rate:  25
   auto repeating keys:  00ffffffffffff7f
                         00ffffffffffffff

                         ffffffffffffffff

Bug Mode: compatibility mode is disabled
PMS (Energy Star):
   Display is not capable of DPMS
Font cache:
   Server does not have the FontCache Extension
===========================================

To me the font path in this output seems correct.

I have disabled all DISPLAY settings that I previously had in  
my .bash_profile and my PATH variable is set according to: export PATH= 
$PATH:/usr/local/bin:/Applications:/usr/X11/bin:/usr/X11/lib:.

Any suggestions about how to fix this problem is greatly appreciated!

Thank you very much!

Best regards,

Martin.

Martin,

as per posting guide you have forgotten all of the very important  
piece of information - R version and the locale. I cannot reproduce  
the problems you describe, so please share with us at least the output  
of sessionInfo().

In general, if you want to use X11 on Leopard seriously, you may want  
to upgrade it (see http://trac.macosforge.org/projects/xquartz ),  
because the version shipped with Leopard is known to be quite broken.

Cheers,
Simon

I recently updated to Leopard and have not gotten the error Martin is  
alluding to when using x11 from the command line. However I have been  
careful to remove any user-specific setting of the DISPLAY variable as  
this is no longer required nor recommended under leopard.

My guess is that you may have stuff from an older configuration file  
around. Did you do "archive and install" and how exactly are you  
running R - under ESS or straight up from the Terminal?

A suggestion that one sees fairly frequently on other mailing lists 
for this class of problem is to create a new user, login as that new 
user, and try from there. If things work, then the hypothesis of 
lurking config files  (or in some cases, broken preference files), is 
considered to be confirmed.

Hmm, I would fire up R on the command line and do something like

Sys.getenv("DISPLAY")
Sys.getenv("PATH")

that way you can figure out what environment variables R is using. How  
they are set is hard to know, but as I said, candidates are (all in  
the HOME directory or perhaps in the directory where you run R)
.profile
.MacOS/.environment.plist
.bashrc
.bash_login
.Rprofile
.Rlib

Having said that, my _guess_ based on the warning messages is that you  
probably have a locale problem (which may or may not be connected to  
whether X11 finds the fonts). I am using the default locale (= I have  
a clean install, uses english as my system language and have not  
touched anything) and I get the following from sessionInfo():
  locale:
  en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/C/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8
whereas you seem to have something different:
  locale:
  C/UTF-8/C/C/C/C
I know little about locales, except that they sometime cause  
problems... :)

Another thing you could try to help debug is to run X11 from the Aqua  
GUI.

As you say, I did indeed have a locale problem. I've never had any  
reasons to worry about locale settings before and therefore know  
hardly anything about them, but if I change the locale according to  
Sys.setlocale("LC_CTYPE", "C") plotting works like a charm. However, I  
have to change the locale every time I start a new session. Is there a  
way to permanently change this setting?

Thank you all for your help!

Best regards,

Martin.

Setting LC_ALL=C in the environment does that.

However, it seems pretty unlikely that you really want to do that in 
Sweden. The issue seems to be that you have the encoding set to an invalid 
value

>locale:
>C/UTF-8/C/C/C/C

is wrong.  So try setting LC_ALL=sv_SE.UTF-8, or if you only want the 
character set to be UTF-8, LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8

I just tested

blacklark% env LC_CTYPE=sv_SE.UTF-8 R
> Sys.getlocale()
[1] "C/sv_SE.UTF-8/C/C/C/C"

and it is displaying correctly on X11 plots.

I suggest you track down the incorrect setting of LC_CTYPE.

Thank you - that did the trick. I simply added

LC_ALL=sv_SE.ISO8859-1
export LC_ALL

to my .bash_profile, and it now works perfectly.

Cheers,

Martin.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] upgrade to 2.6 removes 2.5?
Message-ID: <47E2F325.6070008@ucdavis.edu>

Hi

I just upgraded from R2.5 to R2.6.2 .  When I went to use the 2.6 package installer "Select packages from..." function (i.e. clicking on the magnifying glass) I found that 2.5 was not listed.  A little poking around revealed that my 2.5 installation was gone (/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.5  no longer exista).  It was there the last time my "locate" database was updated, and I used 2.5 this morning.  Has anybody else seen this?

Julin,

R for Mac FAQ  1.4 says
"Mac OS X also keeps an installation receipt if an application was 
installed using the Apple Installer. These receipts are usually kept 
in /Library/Receipts and Apple's Installer decides based on the 
receipt whether a program will be installed or upgraded. If you do 
not want to perform an upgrade (e.g. if you want to keep multiple R 
versions in parallel), you will have to remove the corresponding 
receipt(s). Depending on the OS X version rm -rf 
/Library/Receipts/R-* may work. The exact details are 
system-dependent, please see the corrensponding documentation by 
Apple."

What this means is that if you want to use the previous packages, you 
need to go to the Library/Receipts and drag the  R (something) 
receipt to the trash. In this case, you will get a new installation 
but your old one is still there.  In particular, the old libraries 
are there and can be dragged to the new installation.

A useful add on is to download the  Rswitch GUI from the development 
Mac page at http://r.research.att.com/.  Then, when you download a 
new version (after trashing the receipt to make sure that you keep 
the old version) you can choose which version to use.

Bill

Thanks Bill,

The curious thing is that installing (earlier releases) of 2.6 on other machines did not cause their 2.5 directories to be removed (and I did not delete the installation Receipts).  Maybe this behavior changed between 2.6.0 and 2.6.2?

I don't think this is anything to do with MacOS, and without the 
reproducible example the posting guide asks for there is nothing I can 
see that anyone can do to help.

And what did the maintainer say? (See the posting guide.)

R-help would probably be a better place for answers to your question
(this isn't a Mac specific problem), but at a guess the number of
variables you've specified isn't the same as the number in your
example. Though, I've never used e1071's LCA function (didn't even
know they existed until just now) so I'm not positive.

Agreed this would be better in r-help, but we've got this far, so may  
as well continue.

The lca function isn't particularly good. It is a bit specific about  
data, it requires a matrix, which is probably what is happening here.  
There are also some other failings, such as not allowing for the  
models to be fitted for a selection of random starting values, so is  
likely to get the wrong answer when fitting more than 2 or 3 classes.  
It also requires an observation for every subject rather than  
specifying frequencies. Yes, I should send my comments to the  
maintainer.

A better package is poLCA, but also doesn't allow frequencies to be  
specified. I would set the nrep parameter to at least 10, but 20 is  
better. Has a nice user manual.

I have a package in submission randomLCA which is mainly for LC  
incorporating random effects but fits LC as well. For the moment this  
can be downloaded at http://www.kjbeath.com.au/randomlca/ and  
installed as a Local Source Package. Comments welcome.

I'm not sure if your problem is related to mine - 
today I chose to allow the Apple update program
to update Safari and install security updates.
R.app crashes now every time I try to open it.
(Full crash report at end)

See e.g.
http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=1453379&tstart=0

Did Safari 3.1 get installed on your new drive?

I'd recommend skipping the Safari update to
anyone who gets prompted to install updates
until this issue is resolved.

Today's updates:
2008-03-25 11:59:46 -0700: Installed "Safari" (3.1)
2008-03-25 12:00:05 -0700: Installed "Security Update 2008-002 (PowerPC)" (1.0)

I can still run R in Emacs or at a terminal prompt
but no joy with R.app GUI.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] BLAS/LAPACK/Accelerate on Leopard with R 2.6.2
Message-ID: <F31A28BE-561B-454A-918C-79724E766A0C@gmail.com>

Greetings -- which BLAS/LAPACk are used by R 2.6.2 with gfortran 4.2  
on Leopard?

Macresearch.org instructs to use Accelerate, effectively switching from

# LIBPATH =  -L$/usr/local/lib
# BLAS = -llapack -lf77blas -latlas

to

BLAS = -Wl,-framework -Wl,Accelerate

-- per:

http://macresearch.org/performance_tutorial_part_i_introducing_accelerate

-- is this compatible with that packaged gfortran?

Also -- if I want to try out xlf from IBM, how does that affect the  
choices of BLAS/LAPACK/Accelerate -- are they compatible or does xlf  
come with its own?  (And why I can download trial versions of xlf for  
AIX/Linux but not for Mac?...)

Cheers,
Alexy

Whatever you compile it against!  It looks like you didn't consult the 
R-admin manual before posting, so please do study it now.

I believe that the binary versions distributed from CRAN are compiled 
against vecLib:

blacklark% otool -L libRblas.dylib
libRblas.dylib:

/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.6/Resources/lib/libRblas.dylib 
(compatibility version 0.0.0, current version 0.0.0)
         /System/Library/Frameworks/vecLib.framework/Versions/A/vecLib 
(compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 192.15.0)
         /usr/lib/libgcc_s.1.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current 
version 1.0.0)
         /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current 
version 88.3.9)

since the recommended configure sequence is

./configure --with-blas='-framework vecLib' --with-lapack \
   --with-aqua --enable-R-framework

(see the R-admin manual).

Note that we prefer to have correct answers rather than fast ones, and the 
reference BLAS given by the default options is often more accurate and 
more reliable (and so is the LAPACK distributed -- is is 3.1 so has 
bugfixes against 3.0, but not the several incorrect bugfixes that some 
Linux distributions have). So personally I only recommend using an 
optimized BLAS when you need the performance (and few R sessions use 
enough matrix algebra to do so).

I've checked that --with-blas='-framework Accelerate' also works, but I 
see no real performance difference (and small differences can be hard to 
detect).  (I tested i386, but x86_64 seems also to work.)

> Macresearch.org instructs to use Accelerate, effectively switching from

Hmm, actually it tells you Accelerate uses vecLib for BLAS/LAPACK.

That's always wrong: lapack should never be part of the BLAS.

Ultimately, we don't know.  Different compilers can have different 
argument-passing conventions on the same platform, so we would have to 
look at every call (in vecLib, which is not AFAIK Open Source) on each 
MacOS X architecture to *know*.

This is not idle speculation: gcc3 and gcc4 ('Gnu Compiler Collection') 
have used different calling conventions on x86_64 on Linux and Solaris, so 
it is likely that not all Fortran compilers on x86_64 on MacOS are 
compatible.  (And AFAIR that is why there are vecLibg95c.c and 
vecLibg95f.f in the R sources, and why there are configure tests in R for 
this.)

Only for completeness, the CRAN binary currently ships with both  
vecLib-based Rblas (libRblas.veclib.dylib) and reference Rblas  
(libRblas.0.dylib) libraries. Which one is used can be influenced by  
setting libRblas.dylib symbolic link to one or the other (thanks to -- 
enable-BLAS-shlib option):

cd /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/lib

# for vecLib use
ln -sf libRblas.vecLib.dylib libRblas.dylib

# for R reference BLAS use
ln -sf libRblas.0.dylib libRblas.dylib

(I have added this info to the R for Mac FAQ).

Cheers,
Simon

Shared libraries on MacOS X are dylibs.  These are independent of the  
compiler used to build them.  It matters not if it was gcc 3.x, 4.x  
some Intel/IBM thingy or LLVM-clang.  They are not like shared objects  
on other UNIX/Linux.

The ABI differences do matter when you try to link object files or  
static libraries.

In Tiger/Leopard veclib is a subframework of Accelerate.framework.   
Apple recommends including and linking it as Accelerate.  At some time  
in the future veclib may be merged into Accelerate.  All that matters  
is that Accelerate provides the APIs you would expect from BLAS/LAPACK  
all optimised for the Mac you are using.  Don't worry about what goes  
on inside.  That's Apple's business.

If you think you can build a better BLAS/LAPACK than they do, you are  
welcome to roll your own, but using Accelerate means your code  
automatically, without recompiling, acquires any fixes/optimisations  
that Apple supplies in software updates (and they have supplied such  
updates in the past).

Message-ID: <5D743B28-7999-49CF-AF47-165A16295D0B@mit.edu>

I am a recent convert from Linux to Mac (OS X 10.5.2 on a Mac Pro),  
and  am trying to direct some output from  compiled C code to the  
R.app GUI.  For simple things, of course, I use Rprintf from the R  
API.  But there are other cases (e.g., using the matrix print routines  
in GSL) for which Rprintf is inappropriate.  When I was in Linux-land,  
I could direct the output to stdout with no problem (and I can still  
do that running R from a terminal window on OS X).  But if I run my  
app under R.app, the output never makes it to the screen (naturally,  
because R.app is not standard output).

So, is there an output file that I can use in place of stdout that  
will get my output to the R.app GUI (and preferably, to a terminal  
window session as well)?

Thanks!

If we are to assist you, you should tell us more about your  
application (the C code), because R.app *does* print stdout and stderr  
(just try running system("ls")). Your application is very likely doing  
something to prevent the output from being processed (not flushing the  
output, printing unterminated lines, not allowing R to process  
events...).

My C code is complex (and obscure), so I'd hate to bore the rest of  
the list with the details.  But perhaps this simple example will  
narrow things down. (My shared library is compiled using R CMD SHLIB,  
and loaded into R using dyn.load("xxx.so").  I call the function using  
the .C() function.  The application is straight numerical computation,  
with no fancy graphics or anything like that.)

If I print text using the R API function

	Rprintf("This is some text\n");

then I see that text, whether I run R from either the terminal or  
using R.app.  But, if I use, from the standard C library,

	printf("This is some text\n");

then I see it if I run R in the terminal window, but NOT in R.app.

A more complicated example is if I try to print a gsl vector

	gsl_vector_fprintf(stdout, X, "%.3f");

The result shows up in the terminal window, but not in R.app.  What  
I'd like to do is find something to replace stdout that would  
guarantee that the output goes to the appropriate R window.

I'm not doing anything special to flush output (I'm a new C  
programmer--is this something I need to do?).  I get this problem if I  
am trying to print a single line, as above, or a HUGE number of  
gsl_vectors (it was being caught in an infinite loop of printing  
vectors--and not seeing the output to let me know I was in the loop-- 
that led me to this question).

I hope this is detailed enough.  Please let me know if more  
information is needed.

Thanks,

Michael

Message-ID: <C86D3B66-54D5-4247-90A1-FBDA3897E1D9@cc.usu.edu>

Dear all
We have an old Apple cluster that we use for our stats via R and  
webbioc. It is long overdue for an upgrade. However we have also  
created inhouse tools that we cannot afford to not have daily access to.
While it is highly overdue for an upgrade, there aren't any Panther  
binaries for the latest R either.
Is it possible to install R from source code and not remove the old  
version, which we would still keep until our apps are completely  
transitioned? Is there a link or webpage that explains how-to's on  
this question?

If all you need to do is print a GSL vector, why not just do something  
simple like the following:

for(i = 0; i < n; i++)
     Rprintf("%.3f ", gsl_vector_get(X, i));
}

That is strange that gsl_vector_fprintf is not working, so an  
explanation as to why would still be interesting.

Thank you for everyone's help on this.  I think I have narrowed the  
issue down to the buffer.  When I run R in the terminal, the line:

fprintf(stdout,"testing\n");

gets flushed after each line, but when I run under R.app, all calls  
get flushed at the end of my program.

If I add the line

fflush(stdout);

after each fprintf call in R,app, the text is flushed as expected.

The line

fprintf(stderr,"testing\n");

gets flushed line-by-line in both cases.

So, for some reason, I need to flush the stdout buffer after each line  
in R.app, but not when I run R in terminal.  This is an easy  
workaround, although I am interested by this would work differently in  
the terminal and GUI versions of R.

That is the (POSIX) standard behaviour: stdout is line-buffered when 
writing to a terminal and fully buffered otherwise, and stderr is 
unbuffered.  (I understood that R.app displays output from these files 
only when they contain a complete line.)

I was going to ask what buffering had been set on stdout, and suggest it 
would be worth setting line buffering (via setvbuf) if the above analysis 
is accurate.
