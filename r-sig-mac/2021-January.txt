Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Problem R with Big Sur
Message-ID: <BA212F42-6868-46CC-94EF-2BA2D1038209@univ-rouen.fr>

Dear all,
I have change my MacBook Pro since a few months and now, I have a MacBook Pro 16 with a Touch Bar. 
Yesterday, I have updated my computer with Big Sur and now, when I open R (4.0.3), I have this message when R opens or every time a window opens:

2021-01-05 09:55:30.150 R[1275:42594] Warning: Expected min height of view: (<NSPopoverTouchBarItemButton: 0x7f9f306b3f50>) to be less than or equal to 30 but got a height of 32.000000. This error will be logged once per view in violation.

Before updating to Big Sur, I had not this problem with Catalina.
Has anyone had the same problem? How can I fix it?
Many thanks,
Aur?lie

This has been discussed here on the list recently and I think the
short term fix is to use Rstudio or R from the command line.

I am sure this will sort itself out over time.

I had the same problem (it is with the R  GUI, Big Sur and a Mac with Touch Bar).

The Mac R GUI: "R-GUI-7903-4.0-high-sierra-Debug" works fine.
Those warnings disappeared with this R GUI (with a 16-inch MacBook Pro 2019, Big Sur 11.0.1 operating system and R 4.0.3).

You can download the last R GUI at this address:
https://mac.r-project.org/

The last version is now the 7905. It will probably work fine too.

Dear Maria-Angeles,
Thanks for your experience!
Actually, I have a MacBook Pro 16 ?  2020, Big Sur 11.1 and R 4.0.3. A new version of R 4.1.0 for Big Sur is still under development and unstable. I think we just have to wait?
Following Dr E.W. Lisse advices, I have installed RStudio and all is ok.

I purchased a new 13 inch Apple MacBook Pro with the M1 System on a Chip. I understand that R is not yet available compiled for the M1 SoC hardware, and so I am using Apple?s Rosetta 2. 
However, this MacBook Pro requires Apple macOS Big Sur. From what I see at https://mac.r-project.org/ R has not been compiled for macOS Big Sur. Is there an executable of R for macOS Big Sur available to download?

It is my understanding that R is working via Rosetta 2 but I don?t have an
M1 machine yet to test.
See here:
https://developer.r-project.org/Blog/public/2020/11/02/will-r-work-on-apple-silicon/index.html

There is rapid movement on native ARM compatibility across all languages
and software. Stay tuned but plunge in and report issues when you can.

I use the homebrew R for the Intel and then install.packages(), update.package() from scripts and??Rstudio?s Tools->.

I don?t have an M1 (yet) but would be interested in seeing how that works on the M1. Probably this will pull the sources and hence I would be grateful to read about that.

I have been using both Rosetta emulation and the homebrew builds and
everything looks very good so far.

Here are two Twitter threads on M1 benchmarks.

Hi

Both versions seem to run fine indeed, but on my Mac mini M1, the arm version (homebrew R) is much slower than the intel version (CRAN R), which is quite disappointing.

The speed ratio I get is about 4 times slower for the arm version compared to the intel version, both in single processor and parallel computing mode.

Any idea about why I get these results ?

Thanks,
Jean

Jean: _guessing_ this may be about parallel processing in BLAS? Does your

Yes it is mostly linear algebra, but the slowdown is the same in parallel processing and in single processor mode (4 times slower in both).

For native builds - nothing to report for x86_64 builds running under 
Rosetta which almost all the time 'just work' (and work fast).

The goal remains to release a native binary distribution with R 4.1.0 ca 
April: all but the intrepid are advised to use x86_64 until then.

- There is an experimental R-devel build of the R framework at 
https://mac.r-project.org/ .  That page reports 'failed' but usually the 
framework is complete.

- R.app will need to be partially re-written as it uses Objective C 
features which are no longer supported in Xcode 12.  (I guess this is 
why the page is reporting a failure.)

- There are most parts of a toolchain and a Fortran compiler at 
https://mac.r-project.org/libs-arm64/ (not the earlier versions at 
libs-arm).  These install into /opt/R/arm64, and the R-admin manual has 
been re-written to reflect that and point out some pitfalls.

- Binary packages are planned but the vast majority of packages install 
from source.  I currently have 240 CRAN check failures with 35 failing 
to install and 98 others requiring those (or BioC ones).  If you are 
interested in a particular package, 
https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/bdr/M1mac/ has recent logs for those 
failing directly, listed as 'additional issues' on their CRAN check pages.

Is there a large speed difference for linear algebra operations between the Rosetta x86_64 builds and the native arm64 builds ?
On a Mac mini M1 8/256 I get only a slight speed increase (15% faster) with the arm version (experimental R-devel build).

Thanks
Jean

Speed differences were covered in an earlier report so please look in 
the list archive.  Speeds are really dependent (for both Intel and ARM) 
on the load on the machine and the size of the task: typically the ARM 
version is 40% faster, with a very wide range.

macOS Big Sur has shipped with all Apple Mac computers since Thu 2020-11-12.
The web site https://mac.r-project.org/ shows that as of Thu 2021-01-14 00:56 
1. R compiled for Big Sur for Macs with the Intel CISC x86_64 chip is not available.
2. R compiled for Big Sur for Macs with the Apple M1 RISC chip (=ARM64) FAILED to compile.
So, R is not available to any of us who have bought Apple Mac computers in the past 2 months.

A note posted to R-SIG-Mac on Thu 2021-01-14 by Brian Ripley says 
"The goal remains to release a native binary distribution with R 4.1.0 about April 2021."
A similar note posted on Fri 2021-01-08 said 
"We hope this will be solved by the end of January 2021."

Waiting until April 2021 to run an application on a computer purchased in Nov 2020 seems like a very long wait. I suggest a goal of releasing R compiled for Big Sur for Macs with the Intel CISC x86_64 chip before the end of January 2021.

Hi

- On Intel Macs:

R 4.0.3 binary is available for macOS 10.13 (High Sierra) and higher (including Big Sur).

- On M1 Macs (Big Sur) :

You can use the above R binary in Rosetta mode (faster than on most intel macs)

And, if you are "intrepid" (according to Prof. Ripley): There is an experimental R-devel build of the R framework at https://mac.r-project.org/.  That page reports 'failed' but usually the framework is complete.

Both are doing quite well on my Mac Mini M1 and run faster that on my Intel Core i5 2018 MacBook Pro.

And you can also use RStudio in Rosetta mode.

You are being quite rude, repeating the same incorrect information.

Prof Ripley's notes were not about your system, they were about the M1 Macs.

For your system,

https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/

contains a build of R 4.0.3 that is "for macOS 10.13 (High Sierra) and 
higher".  That's what Jean Thiolouse was referring to.

It's possible that the package on CRAN doesn't work on your system, but 
it doesn't sound as if you've tried it.

Greg,

Perhaps you're confused by the wording? It says "R compiled for High Sierra
OR HIGHER". This is a minimum OS version. It doesn't mean you need to run
High Sierra to use this binary.

Best,
Kasper

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Swift + embedded R
Message-ID: <CAA-FpKU_ff5mHJ+CviCOKL_Erc5eVON7vSrV1vzh2d6-mSnMVw@mail.gmail.com>

Hey folks,

In case there's any interest in using embedded R with Swift/SwiftUI,
I've started a blogdown series on that very thing.

Updates will be over at https://rud.is/books/swiftr/ & the associated
repo is at hrbrmstr/swiftr-book-examples

The book and repo are leading up to an eventual release of two
(Swift/C) packages that will make the bridge easier to integrate into
macOS Xcode Swift projects.

That library will have two modes. One will be the traditional way
embedded R works now with C code (Rf_?, SEXPs, etc).

The other uses a new/recent capability of Swift that makes the
language a bit more dynamic (at the cost of some type safety which is
sad but useful enough to make it cool).

That second mode will make Swift code like this possible:

    _  = try R.evalParse("options(tidyverse.quiet = TRUE )")

    // in practice this wld be called once in a model
    try R.library("ggplot2")
    try R.library("hrbrthemes")
    try R.library("magick")

    // can mix initialization of an R list with Swift and R objects
    let mvals: RObject = [
      "month": [ "Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun" ],
      "value": try R.sample(100, 6)
    ]

    // ggplot2 ex. `mvals` is above, `col.hexValue` comes from the color picker
    // can't do R.as.data.frame b/c "dots" so this is a deliberately
exposed alternate call
    let gg = try R.ggplot(R.as_data_frame(mvals)) +
      R.geom_col(R.aes_string("month", "value"), fill: col.hexValue) +
// supports both [un]named
      R.scale_y_comma() +
      R.labs(
        x: rNULL, y: "# things",
        title: "Monthly Bars"
      ) +
      R.theme_ipsum_gs(grid: "Y")

    // an alternative to {magick} could be getting raw SVG from {svglite} device
    // we get Image view width/height and pass that to {magick}
    // either beats disk/ssd round-trip
    let fig = try R.image_graph(
      width: Double(imageRect.width),
      height: Double(imageRect.height),
      res: 144
    )

    try R.print(gg)
    _ = R.dev_off() // can't do R.dev.off b/c "dots" so this is a
deliberately exposed alternate call

    let res = try R.image_write(fig, path: rNULL, format: "png")

    imgData = Data(res) // "imgData" is a reactive SwiftUI bound
object; when it changes Image does too

All of the "R.?" calls are dynamically looked up in the embedded R session.

It's a WIP (~70% feature complete) and will be introduced in the
bookdown series and repo in a couple weeks.

It likely isn't super useful to a general audience (or perhaps only
useful to me :-) but the latest Swift 5 update made working with R
directly from Swift much, much easier than previously possible.

https://twitter.com/hrbrmstr/status/1344036731855769600?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw
has a running example of the above code.

Cheers?

Message-ID: <B04CF9A4-A78B-4274-A6E8-A2F6A53ED4F2@gmail.com>

Hey! 

I just installed the binary from cran for R-4.0.3 and for some reason I'm missing the R and RScript commands on terminal. I'm on Big Sur 11.1 and when I check if there are symbol links on /usr/bin/ related to R I find none. 

I'm not the only one https://stackoverflow.com/a/64920581/6888648 <https://stackoverflow.com/a/64920581/6888648> 

Does anyone experience this behavior too? If you have updated perhaps you still have those from previous releases, but in case this was a clean install since I decided to change from homebrew to the binary form cran. 

Thanks for the help. 

Cheers!
Luis

I'm not on Big Sur, but I see this:


$ which R
/usr/local/bin/R


So maybe you're looking in the wrong place?

Hey! 

I was and I realized after sending the email. But that path doesn't have also any R symbolic link either. 

Can anyone tell me how many symbolic links to R binaries are there? 

Thanks!

 From the manual

'The installer puts links to R and Rscript in /usr/local/bin. If these 
are missing (as they may be under ?Big Sur?), you can run directly the 
copies in /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/.'

(Footnote 25 in R-admin).

We don't know the exact circumstances when the installer fails (it 
worked for both my Big Sur machines, one upgraded and one new), but you 
can probably for link yourself.

Hey! 

Thanks a lot for the info. Yeah, I've manually symbolinked them. But I just wanted to know if this was documented or it was an error on my side. 

Cheers!

 releases.
Message-ID: <CAD6tx94E94-tAtmnqrcvJt_9Cyn_HY+8JjjxgCftJQ6EOaYbvg@mail.gmail.com>

Recently it seems to have become much more common for the PACKAGES*
metadata to get out of sync with the actual availability of macOS binaries.
e.g. the PACKAGES* metadata will show there is a binary available, but it
is not yet fully synced and users get download failures. We had 4 issues
(and one email) opened in various repositories related to this (about the
withr packages) yesterday.

https://github.com/r-lib/pak/issues/262
https://github.com/r-lib/actions/issues/141#issuecomment-769205048
https://github.com/r-lib/actions/issues/235
https://github.com/r-lib/withr/issues/160#issuecomment-769261447

This is also not an isolated incident with one package, the sf package had
the same thing happen, and I would not be surprised if there were more I am
aware of.

https://github.com/r-spatial/sf/issues/1586

This seems to happen sporadically, but recently has been occurring much
more frequently.

It also seems to only be a problem for the macOS binaries, Windows binaries
don't seem to have this issue. Either because they are synced differently
or because they are built in the same location as the main CRAN mirror.

Using `rsync --delay-updates` could possibly help to ensure more atomic
mirroring if it is not already being used.

I CC'd Kurt on this email as I am not sure he subscribes to R-Sig-Mac, and
he may be able to provide insight into this issue.

Hi,

You are mis-reading that page.

With respect to Apple Silicon (M1/arm64), the *development* version of R 4.1.0, which is not yet released, and is a nightly, unstable, build, does not compile:



That version is not intended for production use.


At the top of the page, you will find the following:




The current, stable, release version of R, which is 4.0.3, works just fine on Intel based Macs running Bug Sur:

  https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/ <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/>

I am running that version on my Intel Mac, running Big Sur 11.1.

If you follow Prof. Ripley's updates on the list, regarding Apple Silicon specifically, you will see additional information, including CRAN package testing:

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] XML packages source compilation on macOS 10.15.7
Message-ID: <D75567CF-FEFE-43C9-A0B3-E9178A917631@gmail.com>

Hello all,

I have to compile the XML package from source for R 4.1 (development version) on a Mac with OS version 10.15.7. It works well on all machines that do not come with any significant ballast on developer tools. One machine, however, that I have used for some time returns a mismatch of header files and library. I looked into possible offenders and purged what I could (e.g. deleted Homebrew although the other machines have Homebrew and Miniconda installed as well) but to no avail.

install.packages(?XML?) fails and install.packages("XML", configure.args=c("LIBXML_INCDIR=/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/include/libxml2", "LIBXML_LIBDIR=/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/lib?)) also fails.

There are obviously differences I cannot track down so far but I am running out of ideas. Both machines have MacOSX10.14.sdk and MacOSX10.15.sdk installed with MacOSX.sdk linking to MacOSX10.15.sdk.

Here is part of the log of a successful compilation, and I was hoping someone could point me towards a solution.

libxml include directory: -I/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/include
libxml library directory: -L/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/lib -lxml2 -lz -lpthread -licucore -lm -lz  -lxml2
libxml 2:                 -DLIBXML2=1

Compilation flags:         -DLIBXML -I/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/include -DUSE_EXTERNAL_SUBSET=1 -DROOT_HAS_DTD_NODE=1 -DDUMP_WITH_ENCODING=1 -DUSE_XML_VERSION_H=1 -DXML_ELEMENT_ETYPE=1 -DXML_ATTRIBUTE_ATYPE=1 -DNO_XML_HASH_SCANNER_RETURN=1 -DLIBXML_NAMESPACE_HAS_CONTEXT=1 -DHAVE_R_CETYPE_T=1 -DHAVE_XML_WITH_ZLIB=1 -DHAVE_XML_HAS_FEATURE=1 -DUSE_R=1 -D_R_=1  -DHAVE_VALIDITY=1 -DXML_REF_COUNT_NODES=1
Link flags:               -L/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/lib -lxml2 -lz -lpthread -licucore -lm -lz  -lxml2


Thanks,
Kemal

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] I'm new to R in a Mac. How do I specify the path in
 read.table()?
Message-ID: <BN7PR08MB4114B81A1F5DDE5E4D8866B6D0B99@BN7PR08MB4114.namprd08.prod.outlook.com>

I?ve tried for over an hour to figure this out with no luck.  I?ve moved the text file (created from excel) to the desktop to simplify the path.  If I click on the file and ask Get Info, it lists ?Where? as  iCloud Drive > Desktop.  If I copy that to the clipboard and paste that into a read.table command in the R interface, it comes up as /Users/DFP/Desktop.  But if I try read.table("\\Users\\DFP\\Desktop\\Monroe319Ecoli.txt"), I get No such file or directory.  How can I get that file into a data frame?
