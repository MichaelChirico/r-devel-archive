Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Right to left languages support in R on Mac
Message-ID: <E729E830A6B823498F9C59EA740495CD561DC729@mscs-bechu-0026.media.int>

Hello. I am wondering if there is a way to support right-to-left languages (arabic, hebrew, ?) in R on  Mac?


>From my own experience and from this thread on SO (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22423760/right-to-left-languages-support-in-r-using-mac) , there is currently a mac-only bug where right-to-left languages are incorrectly displayed on mac.


For instance, if you run the line under. The xlab text provided will be wrongly displayed in the reverse order (left-to-right). Also the linkage between two consecutive letters (i.e. ? connected to ? would be ??) is broken.


plot(1:10,1:10,ylab="hello",xlab="????", cex.lab=4)


This bug seems to have been around for a long time (since at least R 2.15.0) and is still present in R 3.2.2

Hello,

[I am resubmitting this issue because my previous email has its non-latin characters incorrectly displayed on r-sig-mac, which defeats the illustration of the bug...]

I am wondering if there is a way to support right-to-left languages (arabic, hebrew, ?) in R on Mac? There is mac-only bug that messes up right-to-left languages in all graphics. This illustrated in this short RPubs: http://rpubs.com/d-qn/170211

Thank you for your answer.

Unfortunately, I cannot read any right-to-left languages besides the bug I mentioned. But I work in a multilingual environment (newsroom in 10 languages) with arabic journalists but no arabic programmer. I will try find reaching out for R programmers fluent in these languages.

I think however that this bug could be addressed even without any knowledge of a right-to-left language. From this simple example (http://rpubs.com/d-qn/170211), one could immediately see that the xlab text provided got inverted when plotted.

FYI, I have thrown texts in all kinds of non-latin alphabets (cyrillic, japanese, chinese, ? ) and it works fine. Only right-to-left on mac seems broken when plotting (in base graphics, ggplot2, ...) but it is handled correctly otherwise (for instance assigning RTL text to a variable and then printing that variable in the console).

None of the R Core developers are native speakers of languages that use right-to-left writing, and (I think) none of us can even read a bit of them.  So you're likely to have some difficulty with this request.

I'd suggest contacting someone on one of the translation teams (listed at http://developer.r-project.org/TranslationTeams.html), but I don't see any right to left languages there, so they may not be any more help.

This indicates to me that we have a need for expertise in this area.  Do you have experience programming with these languages, or do you have contacts with people who do?

Message-ID: <570CBC9D.70303@univ-reims.fr>

Dear Mac useRs,

A colleague of mine have introduced me to rmarkdown and knitr to produce 
nice reports. The other interesting thing here is to have so-called 
chunks of code, which I find very practical to organize scripts.

I have found that it works well within RStudio. But is there a way to 
enable chunks within the R GUI (and its great editor)?
What I don't like with RStudio (except that I need to install still 
another software, and place is limited on the 256GB SSD of my MacBook 
Air) is that it is not able to work on multiple screens.

Thank you in advance for your help.

Thank you for your answer.

I don't usually use the Terminal, so I'm not sure how to do it.
But do you mean to start it from the Terminal and then use the R GUI or 
do everything in the Terminal? In the latter case, I would prefer using 
RStudio... My question was about using the R GUI Editor rather than RStudio.

Hi Ivan,

Using the R GUI and the built-in editor, you should be able to format your document in the standard Rmarkdown or knitr way and save it with the appropriate extension (Rmd or Rnw), but only run lines within chunks in the console (using command + enter in the normal way). You can make sure all the chunks are working in that way. Then to format the whole document you can use a command in the Terminal as described in the links Tom sent or reopen the document in Rstudio. 

Somehow my R GUI can?t find the right pieces to make the pdf, so I have to use the Terminal. render("EstObsErr.Rmd") produces the error
/usr/local/bin/pandoc EstObsErr.utf8.md --to latex --from markdown+autolink_bare_uris+ascii_identifiers+tex_math_single_backslash-implicit_figures --output EstObsErr.pdf --template /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.2/Resources/library/rmarkdown/rmd/latex/default-1.14.tex --highlight-style tango --latex-engine pdflatex --variable 'geometry:margin=1in' 
pandoc: pdflatex not found. pdflatex is needed for pdf output.
Error: pandoc document conversion failed with error 41

cheers,
Mollie

The failure to find pdflatex may have to do with how R GUI tries to
discover the system path (or pdflatex is actually not on your system). A
while back, Ian Gow suggested adding the location of the pdflatex binary to
the path to fix this issue.

The top of that thread is here:
https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-mac/2015-March/011335.html

The solution suggested by Ian Gow is in the first reply.

hope that helps,

John

Thank you Mollie and all,

So it looks like there's no way to properly use chunks within the Mac R 
GUI.
I will have to decide whether I completely switch to RStudio, or develop 
in the R GUI and then run in RStudio.

Still, until now I was a great fan of the R GUI on Mac so I'm a bit 
frustrated. It would be great if this feature were integrated to the R 
GUI some day! Alternatively, a better GUI for RStudio allowing for 
multiple screens would be fine too (but that's for another list!).

Bests,
Ivan

Hi Ivan,

Can you be more explicit about what it means to you to "enable chunks" or "properly use chunks"? Then developers will understand what you?re looking for.

cheers,

Sorry, I thought it would be clear based on the previous emails...

I don't know much yet about chunks and other functionalities of knitr 
and rmarkdown, so I might be missing some points, but three interesting 
aspects about chunks that I have already notices is that it is possible 
to give them names, expand them or reduce them in the script (making the 
code more readable) and evaluating them but not displaying the results 
in the html/pdf report. This is possible in RStudio, but it seems that 
it is not in the R GUI Editor.

Thanks a lot John.
I had tried, but only with the whole Editor window, not trying to 
extract single tabs from the Editor window...!

Ok, I think I'll switch to RStudio then, but still, the Mac R Editor is 
great ;)

Ivan,

Some of the functionality of R Markdown documents can be found in the R GUI when you work in a script document rather than the console and make use of functions. For instance, the ability to expand or collapse parts of the document (functions can be expanded or collapsed), have code run without output to the console (invisible returns from functions, or assigning function returns to variables).

It doesn?t sound as though this is exactly what you?re looking for?the literate programming concept with rmd documents is very nice?but it might suit your particular needs.

This is possible in RStudio, but it seems that it is not in the R GUI Editor.

Ivan,

Perhaps you are not aware of the ability to open scripts in a new window within the RStudio IDE. Look up the RStudio IDE tutorial on the subject at (https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/207126217-Using-Source-Windows).

However, there is no way to have multiple copies of the same document within the same instance of RStudio. I use multiple instances of RStudio running for that purpose when I am looking at code in more than one location within the same script.

I've found multiple sources windows + graph windows on one monitor and the rest of RStudio on another monitor is reasonably close to my workflow with R.app.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] R freezes when calling rgl after update to El Capitan
	in Mac
Message-ID: <CABjEC1L+0VDHLmD=Pc8T6f1kB0BrNPdkd4vTz1zKYyVWwmAoAQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

I updated my Mac to El capital and when I try to call the library rgl, R
studio just stops working. It won't even respond to force quit.

I have read in the blog several similar problems from Jose G that David
Murdoch helped solving. I have tried them (for example deleting aglrgl.so),
but I am pretty sure there must be something different since I don?t even
get to call a function so that X11 would start (or not) working. Besides,
it freezes in R & Rstudio!

All packages are updated.

Any ideas?

Thanks,

Cris Acasuso

Message-ID: <2A331930-21CD-41A0-9AE7-E33479B6189F@comcast.net>

The Ryacas package was formerly a client-side interface to YACAS (Yet Another Computer Algebra System). I couldn't get either version 1.0.63 or version 1.4.2 to accept Ryacas' client messages on the R 2.3.4/OSX10.11.3 platform, despite being able to run YACAS as a standalone package. I contacted Gabor Grothendieck who was in correspondence with Grzegorz Mazur who had recently bolted on a recent version of YACAS to the package itself, obviating any server-client fragility. It seems to "just work" on my system. The only requirements would be current versions of XCode, Rcpp, XML, and devtools:


if( require(devtools) ) {
    devtools::install_github("ggrothendieck/ryacas") }

Gabor has suggested that interested useRs may want to take this racehorse out on the track for further testing.

David, installs for me and the demo works using r70368 and OS X 10.11.4, most recent Xcode used to compile all the pieces.

I wouldn?t be a regular user but if there is another test you would like, send details.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Experience with upgrade to 3.3.0 beta
Message-ID: <7DDA1E58-29DB-436E-9B7C-5C834F5CFDF7@comcast.net>

I upgraded to 3.3.0 beta from: R-3.3-branch-mavericks-signed.pkg (70Mb, installer incl. GUI)  at the suggestion of Gabor Grothendieck who wanted to know whether Ryacas would install from github in R 3.3.0. So I installed the binary that includes GUI: R.app (which now displays the modern R logo).  It installed without difficulty on El Cap running on an ancient machine (early 2008 MacPro). I then decided to move all my package folders over to the new ../library/ and used a Terminal command to do it:

 cp -r -n /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.2/Resources/library/  /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.3/Resources/library/

I then ran:

update.packages(check.built=TRUE, ask=FALSE)

I replied "y" to questions about building from source and got mostly success on a reasonably large number of packages with just a few problems:


The downloaded source packages are in
	?/private/var/folders/yq/m3j1jqtj6hq6s5mq_v0jn3s80000gn/T/RtmpHlANa6/downloaded_packages?

I tried updating GDAL from

GDAL 1.11 Complete: http://www.kyngchaos.com/files/software/frameworks/GDAL_Complete-1.11.dmg

and then reinstalling rgdal without success

Efforts to install the other failures were ... also failures.


None of these packages are essential to my typical use of R, but I'm thinking others may encounter similar problems, so if there are is a better installation process, perhaps you could let the list know.

Well, to build rgdal and rgeos from source you need to install the 
corresponding libs from https://r.research.att.com/libs/: I think that 
applies to Rglpk as well.

For RPostgreSQL I need Sys.setenv(PG_INCDIR = "libpq") to workaround a 
bug in the package I reported a couple of years ago.

For RODBC see its manual.  There is a slightly simpler way which will be 
in the next release:

<<
At least for OS X 10.9--11, all that is required for
\code{iODBC} is to unpack the sources and use their headers by
something like

\begin{example}
ODBC_INCLUDE=/path/to/libiodbc-srcs/include' R CMD INSTALL RODBC
\end{example}
 >>

CRAN is only showing OS X build logs for R-release, and the rgdal 
version available is rather old as the log has
configure: error: gdal-config not found or not executable.
so something is wrong with the GDAL installation on the build machine.

Hopefully Simon will see this and get the binary packages built.

This is the fortran against which the Mac R is compiled, provided as a disk image:

gfortran-4.2.3.dmg:
http://r.research.att.com/gfortran-4.2.3.dmg

If you had been reading the R-SIG-Mac forum (or searching the archives you should have seen repeated warnings against Macports versions.)

The proper site for Mac questions regarding package compilation.

https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-sig-mac


I'm was using Version 0.99.491 but updated to the same version as you have. The install packages dialog doesn't offer compiling from source as an options so the first test was to see if the binary could be install easily on version 3.3.0 of R.... it did.

I then tried compiling from source and do get the same error as did you. I'm  not a very capable Unix programmer and am unable to tell why this is happening. Perhaps something RStudio is doing? So I tried in the R.app gui with : 

install.packages("~/Downloads/nlme_3.1-127.tar.gz", repo=NULL, type="source")

#==== result=======

> which of course doesn't exist. Any suggestions?

A) Install from binary. That's certainly seems easiest.

Or B)
-- install gfortran 4.8 in the directory that your installation of R expects it to be found. 
Perhaps:

http://r.research.att.com/libs/gfortran-4.8.2-darwin13.tar.bz2

Or at the Unix command line:

curl -s http://r.research.att.com/libs/gfortran-4.8.2-darwin13.tar.bz2 | sudo tar fxj - -C /

(As was suggested by Simon Urbanek two years ago and  was reported successful by Jason Eyerly on R-SIG-Mac.)

But in any case this thread belongs on R-SIG-MAC so copying there, and if any response is needed then when responding you should remove r-help from future replies.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Success with gfortran 5.1 on El Cap and R 3.3.0;

Message-ID: <9FCD0E21-07B2-46FD-B472-1B7B64D632D1@comcast.net>

18 months ago I volunteered to fix a very tiny error in the documentation in the abandoned package, muhaz, so I am now the maintainer. I'm trying to be a responsible maintainer and test my package with R 3.3.0 in advance of its release. (I hope the fact that I have not gotten any email notices from CRAN about failed installation attempts means that all is well with my package under the R 3.3.0 and CRAN's current build machine.) 

Since then I have migrated to El Capitan (which I believe is not yet the current build OS for OSX branches of R).  I was trying to be a responsible maintainer and test my package with R 3.3.0 in advance of its release.  I was getting an error when building from source that my googling efforts suggested is due to incompatibility between El Cap and earlier versions of Fortran. I do not usually get errors with source packages because I have attempted in my halting manner to keep an up-to-date toolchain: XCode, Command_Line_Tools_OS_X_10.11_for_Xcode_7.3 and up until now gfortran-4.8.2-darwin13 from the r.att.research.com site.

* installing to library ?/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.3/Resources/library?
* installing *source* package ?muhaz? ...
** package ?muhaz? successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked
** libs

gfortran-4.8: warning: couldn?t understand kern.osversion ?15.4.0
f951: internal compiler error: Illegal instruction: 4

The GNU Fortran Project mailing list has several contributions from Fran?ois-Xavier Coudert who suggests that El Cap users install Fortran from a disk image installer that he makes available:

http://coudert.name/software.html

gfortran 5.2 for Yosemite:  http://coudert.name/software/gfortran-5.2-Yosemite.dmg  , which I downloaded.
.... noting that the author says "works well with El Capitan"

I've also found several other versions of gfortran at:

http://hpc.sourceforge.net/index.php

... where versions 5.1, 5.3,and 6.0 are listed as appropriate for El Capitan.

It wasn't clear to me whether I needed to have matching sets of gcc and gfortran if I used these, but it appeared to me from the material I read in the R Install/Admin Guide that I would not need to add that additional complexity. 

I wondered:
1) If I install this version of Fortran, what are my odds of failing to fix my problem and also crippling my capacity for compiling packages from source that were compiled and tested on Fortran 4.8.2. (I've decided to take the risk.)

2) If I succeed with this for compiling muhaz, then will I later need to revert and what will I need to do to revert if needed.

Arguably I could have posted this on the package-devel mailing list, but since my best-guess is that specific interfaces with the Mac OS are at the heart of this issue, I'm sticking with R-sig-mac until advised to move on.

I've attempted to read through the Install/Admin document and have derived some knowledge:

a) from section 6.3 and $ R CMD INSTALL --help: may use:

--configure-args=ARGS
			to set arguments for the configure scripts (if any)

b) sect 6.3.2:  "Entries [to either  `/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/etc/Makeconf` or `~/.R/Makevars`] which may need to be changed include ?CC?, ?CXX?, ?FC?, ?F77?, ?FLIBS? and the corresponding flags, and perhaps ?CXXCPP?, ?DYLIB_LD?, ?MAIN_LD?, ?SHLIB_CXXLD?, ?SHLIB_FCLD? and ?SHLIB_LD?."

c) modifications to these might be placed in `~/.R/Makevars` but the next subsection says they could be placed in `HOME/.R/Makevars-R_PLATFORM` which I'm quite sure is a different location.

And then there is a three line example for setting up Fortran on a Mac which appeared extremely relevant to my growing list of questions. I noticed that it has reference to /usr/local/gfortran/bin/gfortran and then uses FLIBS = -L/usr/local/gfortran/lib/gcc/x86_64-apple-darwin14/5.2.0 which appeared to be a good match to the gfortran referenced above.

Emboldened by the resemblance of this worked example to the disk image mentioned above I ran the installation dialog and do now have exactly the folder structure implied by that three line config example. Now believe I can either repeat the INSTALL command with trailing configure-args, or modify Makeconf , or I can construct a config file of some sort in HOME/.R/Makevars-R_PLATFORM. I chose to do the second options since I was unable to divine what the proper incantation might be for the "R-PLATFORM" section of that string. I decided to replace the "gfortran section" with this, attempting to alter only those lines that matched the three altered lines in the Admin/Install example:

FC = /usr/local/gfortran/bin/gfortran
FCFLAGS = -Wall -g -O2 $(LTO)
## additional libs needed when linking with $(FC), e.g. on Solaris
FCLIBS = 
F77 = /usr/local/gfortran/bin/gfortran
F77_VISIBILITY = 
FFLAGS = -g -O2 $(LTO)
FLIBS =  -L/usr/local/gfortran/lib/gcc/x86_64-apple-darwin14/5.2.0 -L/usr/local/gfortran/lib -lgfortran -lquadmath -lm
FCPICFLAGS = -fPIC
FPICFLAGS = -fPIC

Then:

$ R CMD INSTALL /Users/davidwinsemius/muhaz_1.2.6.tar.gz 

Followed by compiler messages and R message and finally ...
* DONE (muhaz)

OK. I guess reading the manual and googling really does "work".

Are you compiling on a computer with an Intel Core 2 Duo?
I had  that problem too.

See here https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-mac/2014-May/010894.html
and Simon's reply.

I now have a computer with an i5 processor; the gfortran 4.8.2 from r.att.research.com works without that message.

In this thread https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-mac/2015-October/011641.html
Brian Ripley in reply to my query said that Coudert's gfortran could be used.

This is on an early 2008 MacPro: Quad-Core Intel Xeon (and I was getting a different error relating to osversion.) This is the oldest MacPro that El Capitan supports and I'm wondering if the next OSX version will drop it from support.

That was the gfortran version that was throwing the error.

I see that now, but I instead read the Admin/Install document and thought it was specific enough to attempt a solution which fortunately succeeded. I didn't have a ~/.R/Makevars file and didn't know how it would work. I thought apparently incorrectly that such a file was designed only for environment variable settings. I got the impression that modifying Makeconf would be the preferred method. Appears I could have gone that route as well after reading Prof Ripley's posting.

I would not necessarily have found that thread because I was searching on the specific error message and the original poster upthread did not include any specifics. She apparently had enough knowledge to be satisfied with  "general" problems statements and the correspondingly general responses, while I'm somewhat more limited in my capacities to muck with "internals".

Best;
David

I am still having the problem that when I execute ?library(ggplot2) getting and error that Rcpp.so cannot be found. This happens in the gui(v1.66) and RStudio, R(3.2.4).  Prior to the upgrade in ggplot this did not happen.
Until I can fix this I must do all my Rwork on windows.

Thank you

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Intermittent plotting failures on new Quartz window
Message-ID: <3BE45281-70CD-4FDE-8678-06C5BA6A32C0@igb.illinois.edu>

Hi, all. I?m getting some puzzling, intermittent plot failures that seem to occur only when I?m in an interactive session, arranging plots with very different drawing speeds, and only when Quartz needs to open a new window before plotting. 

I posted a longer version of this at https://gist.github.com/infotroph/c68fc7a3f8594473361f87e2a348ddf9, but here?s a minimal example:

set.seed(34565)
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)
library(grid)

p1 = ggplot(diamonds, aes(x, price))+geom_point() 
p2 = ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg))+geom_point()

graphics.off()
pp=arrangeGrob(p1, p2)
grid.draw(pp)

Expected result: New graphics window containing a two-panel plot with diamonds on the top and cars on the bottom.
Observed result: Usually (~80% of the time?), a new graphics window with the top panel incompletely drawn (usually just axes with no points or panel grid), and the bottom panel as expected. Rarely (~20%?), the complete plot as expected. 

I can modulate the success rate somewhat by putting different lengths of Sys.sleep() in between the arrangeGrob and grid.draw calls, and I can guarantee success by calling dev.new() before arrangeGrob. See the above-linked Gist for details and for session info from a few other folks ? thus far only the Quartz users can reproduce it, hence my starting with this list.
