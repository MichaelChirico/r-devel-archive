Well, if you want to use Gtk2 and glade, you should install Gtk2 in  
the first place. I don't know of any 64-bit binary, so you probably  
have to do that yourself. This has nothing to do with R ...

Cheers,
Simon

PS: Building GTk2 from sources is not quite trivial, but I have some  
scripts that may help you:
https://svn.r-project.org/R-dev-web/trunk/QA/Simon/R-build/misc/
I have not tested it as 64-bit build, but it should at least give you  
the list of dependencies and some idea of the special flags you'll need.

Hi Ben, Andrew,

I am facing the same problem (R 2.7.2 running on Mac OS X 10.5.5 Build

tar: You must specify one of the `-Acdtrux' options

Here an error. This installation usually does work...

  Since this is not my package (and I'm still not a Mac user),
I really have no idea ... I never heard back from Andrew, don't
know if he found a solution or if the problem went away by itself

  good luck

Clearly tar is not in the PATH. Your PATH variable can be different  
from application to application and in this case however you have  
started R (GUI?), tar is not being picked up. And which tar are you  
using? Xcode, FInk, Macports.

Ok, I guess I was being a bit unhelpful. You are trying to install a  
binary from Bioconductor. This should work out of the box. What  
version of R are you using. If you are doing 64bit computing you need  
to install from source. Of course, that does not change that tar seems  
to be missing which is a mystery. But my guess is that you have done  
something non-standard since for most people it works out of the box.

I must recognize that to set PATH keeps being a mystery for me.

How could I print out the PATH R is using? In a terminal:

sh-3.2# echo $PATH
/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11/bin:/usr/local/apache-maven/apache-maven-2.1.0-M1/bin
sh-3.2#

sh-3.2# find . -name tar
./Applications/Fetch.app/Contents/Frameworks/StuffItCore.framework/Versions/A/Plug-Ins/tar.bundle/Contents/MacOS/tar
./Applications/StuffIt 11/StuffIt 
Expander.app/Contents/Frameworks/StuffItCore.framework/Versions/A/Plug-Ins/tar.bundle/Contents/MacOS/tar
./System/Library/Tcl/tcllib1.8/tar
./usr/bin/tar
./usr/share/ant/docs/javadocs/org/apache/tools/tar

No GUI, just R Console.

Thanks for your help,

Ricardo

Yeap! I have them. And when I installed reshape, weren't installed. 
Please, how could I fix my installation? What does DevTools modify that 
affects install.packages functioning?

Thanks!

Ricardo,

Have you tried reinstalling the latest version of R?  That would seem
to be the first step to take.

You can print and set environment variables from within R by doing

Sys.getenv("PATH")
Sys.setenv(PATH = "SOMETHING")

When you start R from the command line it should inherit the PATH  
(although that depends on how you set it - and note that it looks as  
if you are using SH and not say BASH).

Since you are installing a binary from Bioconductor under something I  
guess is the CRAN binary (I cannot be 100% with the info you are  
providing), it really should work. You should not need to have the  
DevTools installed.

I'd grab the source to install.packages and see if for some reason 
there's a hard-coded path to tar.
Not that I'm a highly skilled coder, but I sure would have hoped that 
the author of install.packages would at least have made sure that,if 
it's calling system functions (like /bin/sh), it would make sure to pick 
up the user environment -- not just grab the R console's idea of the 
environment.


Here an error. This installation usually does work...

It is a bit weird to receive a message concerning sh. As far as I know, 
I am using BASH. In fact, I have recently modified /etc/bashrc to 
include some Maven variables. I now reads...

*****
sh-3.2# cat bashrc
# System-wide .bashrc file for interactive bash(1) shells.
if [ -z "$PS1" ]; then
   return
fi

PS1='\h:\W \u\$ '
# Make bash check its window size after a process completes
shopt -s checkwinsize

# Maven Settings
export M2_HOME=/usr/local/apache-maven/apache-maven-2.1.0-M1
export M2=$M2_HOME/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$M2
export MAVEN_OPTS=-Xmx600m
sh-3.2#

*****
sh-3.2# echo $PATH
/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11/bin:/usr/local/apache-maven/apache-maven-2.1.0-M1/bin
*****

 From R Console:

*****

                               PATH
"$M2:$PATH:/usr/local/bin"

 From your comments, I've done...

And now the installation works smoothly...

I required DevTools for several buildings here not related with R.

Thanks for your help!

I'm afraid I don't understand your answer.Why to have or not to have

Please send me the full log. The GUI simply displays all error  
messages even if they were not produced by R but some of the plugins  
or other loaded code. Hence it is not necessarily a bug in the GUI.  
Please also have a look at FAQ 12.4 just to make sure you don't have  
any rogue plugins.

If you really think this is a bug, please don't forget to post  
sessionInfo() as well as the machine type you're using.

Thanks,
Simon

It seems as though tar is in bash's PATH, but not R's PATH.  How are
you starting R?

If you're starting R by clicking R.app, you might try running 
"open /Applications/R.app" from a terminal instead.  This way, open inherits
PATH from bash, and R.app will inherit PATH from open.

Ok, this is clearly wrong. As you can see in your output, this PATH  
does not contain /usr/bin where tar is. In my case I get
R> Sys.getenv("PATH")
                                                                                       PATH
"/Users/khansen/Bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/ 
texbin:/usr/X11/bin"

This looks like a failed attempt at setting the PATH somewhere. What  
you see is where similar to the syntax you use in your .bashrc file  
but with stuff jumbled a bit. So my wild guess is that you have tried  
setting your PATH somewhere else and that this gets picked up. Do you  
have a .profile file. In fact I would do something like

# cd
# grep PATH * .*
(star space dot star), to see if you are playing with the PATH  
somewhere else.

Are you on a multi-user system? (Could your sys admin have played with  
site-settings?)

My comment about BASH and SH was just based on your prompt. It is  
normal that R uses SH for its purposes, that is pretty standard.

The reason why people are talking about DevTools is that this is  
needed in order to compile from source. And a lot of tools are found  
in the DevTools. And most of us cannot remember if tar came from  
DevTools or with a standard Mac OS X. But I am pretty sure it is part  
of standard OS X.

GMXUX-Ricardo-Rodriguez:~ rrodriguez$

In fact I realized that I was using the wrong order of variables! The 
right one is $M2:$PATH. But this has nothing to do with the issue we are 
dealing with now.

Could this .bash_profile.bak be the problem? I have left this file there 
while trying to set some variables I need to work with Maven in 
/etc/.bashrc.

I think years ago Mac OS X used tcsh as default shell. But today bash is 
the default one. The "funny" thing is that sudo su apparently switch to 
sh. I can not say much on this. Just that your comment called my 
attention on this.

I got it! tar is part of the standard OS X distribution as ./usr/bin/tar

Thanks for your help!

I was starting R by clicking the R.app icon. To run "open 
/Applications/R.app" did the trick. Thanks.

I've just replied to the last message posted by Kasper. I've been 
dealing with PATH to get Maven integrated in my environment. Perhaps 
some of this actions has affected the way R get its environment. I can 
not explain what is happening here and why there is this difference 
between R environments when launched from the terminal or by clicking 
the R.app icon. I keep trying.

Thanks.

Please, follow the thread "/bin/sh: tar: command not found". It seems
that there is some kind of issue with the PATH I've set in my
environment and how R interprets it.

Ok, I think I know what went wrong now

The key information was that you are using R.app (the GUI) which was  
not clear to me until now.

First I would say however that you seem to be messing around a bit. In  
your previous email you said you had modified .bashrc to include the  
long PATH setting, but in your grep below, bashrc is not mentioned. So  
I assume you have deleted it in the meantime?

Anyways, you seem to have been playing around a bit with your  
environment variables and how to set them. In general graphical  
applications on OS X does not care about what you do in your .bashrc  
or .bash_profile, period. But you have still managed to kind of screw  
things up :). And whatever you do in your .bashrc or .bash_profile  
won't have any effect on R.app because it does not care about these  
files (so you may answer, how come that # open -a R.app ... worked?  
Well, that is because you launched R from inside Terminal, and in that  
case it inherits stuff from Terminal).

So what are the options for what you could have done
1) You have created an environment.plist variable inside inside  
~/.MacOS like described in the following note:
   http://developer.apple.com/qa/qa2001/qa1067.html
In order to check for this you could do something like
   # find ~/ -iname "environment.plist"
(this will take a while)

2) You have messed with your system wide settings in /etc. You could  
look for the M2 problem you have by doing
   # cd /etc
   #grep -R M2:

3) You have played with the R installation (unlikely)

If you are truly desperate, you could execute the grep command from /,  
but that will take ages.

So once you have located it, what is your fix?

0) delete or restore the file you located above
1) keep everything in .profile instead of .bashrc and .bash_profile
2) You may have to log out and log in again.
3) If you really want to use your apache-maven PATH in R, do the  
following: create a file called ~/.Rprofile and put the following in it
Sys.putenv(PATH=SOMETHING)
Thats is probably the best long term solution.

I've done it. I hasn't effect on the PATH. I forgot to delete it. I

I don't to use the apache-maven PATH in R. This problem arises when 
trying to install a packages and R was not able to find tar.

Now that I have:

1. deleted ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist
2. restored the original /etc/bashrc script
3. created a ~/.profile script with the following content that allow me 
to have access to the Maven release I do need:

# Maven Settings
export M2_HOME=/usr/local/apache-maven/apache-maven-2.1.0-M1
export M2=$M2_HOME/bin
export PATH=$M2:$PATH
export MAVEN_OPTS=-Xmx600m

In spite of this, I keep getting this in R:

*****
 > Sys.getenv("PATH")
                      PATH
"$M2:$PATH:/usr/local/bin"
 >
*****

If I launch R from a terminal all runs smoothly.

The ~/.Rprofile didn't work. Here the content of the ~/.Rprofile file:

Sys.putenv(PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11/bin:/usr/local/bin)


I am running sudo grep $M2:$PATH: -R  * .* in the root directory now. I 
will keep this thread posted. I am not able to figure out where is the 
problem. Thank you so much for your help.

Best,

Ricardo

Thanks Carl. It seems that I've messed up things somewhere in my system 
and that the problem has nothing to do with a hard coded path. Any idea 
will be welcome in the [R-SIG-Mac] /bin/sh: tar: command not found thread!

If I understand the Leopard architecture correctly, you don't want to  
mess around with /etc/bashrc to set additional paths. Rather, add a  
new file to /etc/paths.d/ which contains _only_ the extra search path.  
This should be included automatically in $PATH when you start a new  
Terminal session, but won't work for R.app either.

This looks pretty wrong to me, although I'm not really familiar with  
Apple's property lists. You seem to assume that property lists  
understand bash's $XXX notation for variable interpolation, which I'm  
quite sure won't work. I suspect that you have to insert the FULL,  
EXPANDED path list here, as printed when you type "echo $PATH" in the  
Terminal.

Hope this helps,

You are correct Stefan, the $PATH would not expand itself, which is  
why Ricardo saw seeing what he was seeing as a path within   R.app.  
Ricardo, you should avoid using the environment.plist file. After you  
delete it, which I think you have done already, you MUST restart the  
system for the changes to take effect. Your systems should be back to  
normal then, and R.app should be able to find /usr/bin/tar just fine  
on its own after that.

Thanks Haris! But the restart seems to have no effect on these values as 
posted before. Please, any idea?

This works fine, thank you. Please, is it possible to modify the
position where  the new path will be inserted in $PATH? It is added at
the end of the string by default. I would like to insert in at the
beginning.

This makes sense. Thanks for the tip. What I am not able to work out now
is to know how and why R.app is picking up this valeu for PATH...

> Sys.getenv("PATH")
                      PATH
"$M2:$PATH:/usr/local/bin"
>

I am not able to figure out where am I setting this value for PATH. M2,
M2_HOME and MAVEN_OPTS, the variable I've been dealing with, are not set
in the shell...

GMXUX-Ricardo-Rodriguez:~ rrodriguez$ echo $M2

GMXUX-Ricardo-Rodriguez:~ rrodriguez$ echo $M2_HOME

GMXUX-Ricardo-Rodriguez:~ rrodriguez$ echo $MAVEN_OPTS


But all three are set in R!

> Sys.getenv("PATH")
                      PATH

> Sys.getenv("M2")
                                              M2
"/usr/local/apache-maven/apache-maven-2.0.9/bin"
> Sys.getenv("M2_HOME")
                                     M2_HOME
"/usr/local/apache-maven/apache-maven-2.0.9"
> Sys.getenv("MAVEN_OPTS")
         MAVEN_OPTS
"-Xms256m -Xmx512m"


.Rprofile works fine and I am able to control variables with this file
but, I there is not .Rprofile, where could am I be setting these
variables? Does .RData store these values?


I would like to understand where am I wrong. Thanks for your help!

Good question, I'd like to know this myself!

Any Mac experts out there who can help us? Are the extra paths in /etc/ 
paths.d/ included alphabetically (by file name)? I suppose it's  
intentional that they go _after_ the standard system directories,  
otherwise you might mess up your OS X installation pretty badly ...

It's obvious where you get the $M2:$PATH from -- that's what you've  
specified in environment.plist. I don't know where /usr/local/bin has  
been added, though. Perhaps something that R does automatically so you  
always have access to the GNU Fortran installed with R?

Well, they're set in your environment.plist file above. When you start  
R.app, it gets its environment variables from this property list,  
while the Terminal uses the "normal" .bashrc-based mechanism and seem  
to ignore environment.plist.

Stefan

Message-ID: <c502a9e10810060909o5650d4a9k7bd84f8176d1174d@mail.gmail.com>

I have aqua macs installed.  I would like to use this with a R 2.7.2
that I built on os x 10.3.9.  R works fine in the X11 terminal, but I
can not copy and paste ...  I would like to use aquamacs as my
interface to R.  It starts up fine and interfaces with R preforms
computations,  but when i issue the X11() command it does not open up
a window.  I used the command at the x11 terminal as to the aquamacs
FAQ
export DISPLAY=0.0

then I checked to see if aquamacs recognized to use x11 (I don't
remember the exact command right now) and it returned nil.  So, how do
I get aquamacs to interface with x11.

thanks

As you can understand from the comments in the /bin/sh: tar thread,  
you cannot expect Aquamacs to pick up environment variables you set  
inside Terminal / xterm.

The - by far - easiest way for you to proceed is to set the  
environment variables inside R using Sys.putenv, and place everything  
in .Rprofile

So do the following:
create ~/.Rprofile with the content

Sys.putenv(DISPLAY = ":0.0")

(I think the colon has to be there, but I may be a bit rusty in my  
DISPLAY syntax, so check out the right syntax online. You can check  
whether it works by doing
Sys.getenv("DISPLAY")
inside of R.)

You need to start the X11 server manually.

You could also have used .Renviron, but (unfortunately) that file is  
not parsed when you execute R CMD BATCH, so personally I don't like  
using it.

Just my 2 cents: Sys.putenv has been deprecated. Sys.setenv does its 
work without warnings.

You are completely right! I "thought" that I deleted this 
environment.plist in my ~/.MacOSX folder. I didn't! Sorry for the noise! 
Once I delete this file and restarted R (to restart the box/session was 
not required), the PATH in R has been set as expected.

Thanks for your help. Let's see if others can help us with the paths.d 
related question!

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Packages not installing to user space
Message-ID: <C50FB795.AF70%ralmond@ets.org>

I recently upgraded my computer and I'm trying an experiment in which my
day-to-day usage account does not have admin privileges.

I'm trying to install a package (say coda) using the "At User Level" option
and the package installer GUI.  The package downloads correctly and no error
message is reported at the console.  However, when I try load the packages,
I get an error message:

> library(coda)
Error in library(coda) : there is no package called 'coda'

Additionally, .libPaths() only returns the system library, nothing in my
home directory.

> .libPaths()
[1] "/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/library"

Oops.  I just figured this out.  There is an option in the preferences that
add $HOME/R/x.y/library to .libPaths().   I would argue that this needs to
be turned on by default, as most users without admin privileges will have
difficulty finding it (I certainly took me 1/2 of poking around).

That is in fact the default. (I.e. the default is 'enabled' if you  
don't have admin privileges). You probably had admin privileges when  
first running the GUI so is was disabled for you.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] bug: locale not detected by R.app 2.7.2 ?
Message-ID: <48EBD419.1020802@let.uu.nl>

Dear Developers,

After upgrading from R 2.6.2 to 2.7.2 on my MacBook I've run into an 
annoying little problem (warning). It seems that the R.app interface 
does not detect the proper system locale (international) settings, 
whereas R in shell mode has no such problem, see the logs below. 
This is irritating because I'm working with strings containing 
non-ASCII characters.


1. Here's a log of R.app Console window:

3. Settings

I've read the R for Mac OS X FAQ (see Help) section 9.
My settings are customized, i.e. a mix of US and European 
conventions for Language and Format. Hence I'm not strictly 
following one country setting. Nor do I want to.

I'm using UTF-8 systemwide however.

Unknown-00-1e-52-82-78-89:~ Hugo$ sw_vers
ProductName:	Mac OS X
ProductVersion:	10.5.5
BuildVersion:	9F33

In the above cases R was run from my user home directory ~.

If you can provide some insights about the cause of this problem, 
and possible remedies, I'd be delighted to hear!

Many thanks for your assistance, with kind regards,

Hugo Quen?

Hugo,

this is not a bug - please follow the instructions as R is telling you:

"Please read R for Mac OS X FAQ (see Help) section 9 and adjust your  
system preferences accordingly."

And precisely for your setup that tells you:
"If you use a non-standard setup (e.g. different language than  
formats), you can override the auto-detection performed by setting  
force.LANG defaults setting, such as for example

defaults write org.R-project.R force.LANG en_US.UTF-8
will enforce US-english setting regardless of the system setting.  
Please note that you must always use .UTF-8 version of the locale,  
otherwise R.app will not work properly."


Cheers,
Simon

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] quartz fonts
Message-ID: <8403A45A-ED86-45DB-8F3B-4612C071ECCC@vanderbilt.edu>

I'm having problems printing a PDF via LaTeX that was created in R for  
OS X (latest versions). The package that created the files was akima;  
that's probably irrelevant. I can't print the PDFs from Preview when  
they are in a LaTeX generated PDF, although I can print them in their  
original form. The files are temporarily at

http://public.me.com/dairey

in the bad_pdf directory. I'm printing to an HP Laserjet (1320). The  
PS error is complaining about ArialMT as far as I can tell. But when I  
read help for quartz(), the top of the help file says,

family
this is the family name of the font that will be used by the device.  
Default "Helvetica".

and the bottom of the help file says,

The default font family is Arial.

So which is it? And why when I use quartz.options(family="Arial",  
reset=TRUE), do quartz() devices not respect my command? All resulting  
graphs still look like Helvetica. Could this be the problem with  
printing PDFs? Why is the GUI preferences for changing the font there  
but one cannot alter the font?

I'd recommend using the quartz() device instead of the x11() one. The  
display is much nicer and it doesn't require X11. Just put

	options(device = "quartz")

in your ~/.Rprofile file to set it as the default device.

Better to set env variable R_INTERACTIVE_DEVICE as per the help for 
options(), since you don't want a device that does not work in 
non-interactive sessions.  (It is also better to use 
options(device=grDevices::quartz) to ensure visibility of the device when 
you need it, in case something else has a function quartz).

This is assuming that quartz() actually works on 10.3.9: I didn't think it 
did (in the current incarnation).

quartz does not, but I am very happy with using x11 on 10.3.9-  It is
for tinkering-  when I want to drink some coffee and do a little data
exploration.  I use Sys.setenv(DISPLAY=":0.0") at the start of every
session because I can't seem to get the .Rprofile file to work
correctly.  I have edited my .Rprofile in the home directory, but
indeed it doesn't work (which simply means I don't know what i am
doing).
thanks

Let's not spend our time and resources thinking about things that are
so little or so large that all they really do for us is puff us up and
make us feel like gods.  We are mammals, and have not exhausted the
annoying little problems of being mammals.

I don't know (it is your machine), but here's my guess ....

I dom't see R_DEFAULT_DEVICE set on my Mac, but note that 
R_INTERACTIVE_DEVICE takes precedence in interactive use.  So something in 
your setup is different from mine, maybe some startup files or R.app 
preferences?  The first diagnostic step is to see if R_INTERACTIVE_DEVICE 
is set and why R_DEFAULT_DEVICE is set (and see below for why the current 
setting is dangerous).

As to where you should set it, it depends on who you want to set it for, 
and how you run R (from R.app or from the command line).  But Renviron is 
not the right place: a file Renviron.site in that directory would be if 
you want a system-wide setting (see ?Startup).  But do be careful, as if 
you make quartz the default for remote interactive or batch sessions you 
are likely to get undesirable behaviour (possibly even crashes for some R 
versions).  In short, don't set R_DEFAULT_DEVICE to an screen device.

Thanks a lot for the clarifications and helpful information, Prof.  
Ripley.

A related question along the line: The reason I wanted to have quartz  
instead of X11 was that quartz() automatically provides antialiasing  
effect when drawing lines when using dev.new(). I just noticed that  
on http://developer.r-project.org/blosxom.cgi/R-devel it says "dev.new 
() gains a '...' argument which can be used to passed named arguments  
which will be used if appropriate to the device selected". So does it  
mean I can expect that I could specify an option such as "antialias"  
in dev.new() in version 2.8.0 so that I would have antialiasing  
effect in case X11() is invoked?

Thanks again,
Gang

No.  Antialiasing is the default in the Cairo type on X11 in 2.7.x, but 
you can set it on/off via X11.options().

I wrote the above earlier. Turns out, when I save a PDF from the  
quartz device, and include it in a latex document, I get a memory full  
error associated with definefont postscript command. If I make the PDF  
using the pdf() function, I get no error from printing the figures in  
latex. So I think there is some kind of bug/difference between saving  
a PDF from the quartz() device and creating a PDF using pdf(). Also, I  
note that the figures are not quite rendered exactly the same.

pdf() is not involved when you save from a quartz() device.  There 
certainly is a difference, a completely different R graphics device 
involving MacOS system calls is used by quartz().

A bug in the Mac OS perhaps, or an interaction between the Mac OS and  
HP Printers. I had someone tell me a Brother printer worked with the  
files I posted. Thanks. At least I know more now.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Use of .FIrst() in R.app
Message-ID: <C51E28BB.58E6%JonsenI@mar.dfo-mpo.gc.ca>

Hi,

I am having problems using .First() with R.app (v 2.7.2 under OS X 10.5.5);
.First appears to be ignored on startup. I would expect .First to be
executes as it resides in .RData. .First() does work in the command-line
version of R under Mac OS X but my specific task requires R.app. I can find
no reference to this issue in the Mac OS X FAQ or in other manuals, does
anyone have a solution for this?

B. Ripley suggested that .First may not exist or does not work in R.app, but
this is not the case as typing .First() in R.app produces the expected
result. 

Thanks,

Yes, it was an oversight which should be now fixed. Please try R.app  
from SVN or wait for tonight's build.

	<mypkg> has a Makefile
Message-ID: <48F94260.2080400@fhcrc.org>

Hi,

This problem has already been reported here more than 1 year ago by Brian J. Lopes:

  https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-mac/2007-May/003863.html

It's still present in R 2.8.0 beta (2008-10-07 r46631) on Mac OS X as you can see
on the last build/check report for the xps package (Biosconductor):

  http://bioconductor.org/checkResults/2.3/bioc-LATEST/xps/pitt-buildsrc.html

xps has a Makefile in its src/ folder (with a "clean:" target) and 'make clean'
works fine for me if I run it manually from within the src/ folder on build
machine pitt. However, 'R CMD build' fails to clean the src/ folder because
it's apparently trying to access
  /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.8/Resources/etc/Makeconf
instead of
  /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.8/Resources/etc/<arch>/Makeconf

Are there any chance that this could be addressed?

Thanks in advance,
H.

Maybe, but (AFAICS, see also below) no one submitted a patch to the 
appropriate list (r-devel) nor even a 'wish' to R-bugs.

Why are you using a test version over a week old?  CRAN tests on the 
current (when the test round started) version of R.

A chance, but not in code freeze for 2.8.0.  (Your timing is the worse 
possible.)

That's an unusual setup (developing on a system with sub-architectures). 
If you submit a tested patch it is more likely to be 'addressed' once the 
R-2-8-branch is open again.

Message-ID: <48FBABC6.6040804@education.wisc.edu>

Greetings,

My apologies if this is a very simple question.  I downloaded and 
installed a couple of packages today.  In the package manager in R for 
Mac (version 2.7.2), I find that when I try to load the package, I 
can't.  The load button never clicks on.  Why is that?  As an example, 
I'm trying to use Ryacas.  Thanks in advance,

David

Because there is apparently a problem with that package. Check the  
console for results. Clicking on the checkbox (there is no load button  
afaics) simply issues a "library" command and the checkbox itself  
represents the real state of the package so if it failed to load for  
nay reason, it will stay unchecked.

Cheers,
Simon

Hi Dave,
I've also had problems with the Package manager. I haven't figured 
out how to use packages that I've downloaded directly from the 
cran website.

I found another way of doing it instead: in the R Package 
Installer, choose CRAN (sources). Then click "Get List". You can 
install packages from the list (with location set to "At system 
level"). Then they load just fine using the load() function in the 
command window.

I hope this helps. If someone else knows of another way to install 
downloaded packages, I would be interested to learn because it has 
caused me some frustration.
thanks,
Mollie

Sorry, I meant to say to use library() not load() in the command 
window.

Can you be more specific, please? Neither of you has described a  
problem with the packages - the Package Manager is there primarily to  
browse the documentation, not install packages... If you have problem  
installing packages, please tell us exactly what you're doing and what  
errors you get ...

Cheers,
Simon

It seems likely that

install.packages("<path/to/downloaded/file>", repos=NULL)

is what Mollie is looking for (works for source or binary packages, but 
for source packages you currently need to add 'type="source"').  If you 
want to use a GUI to choose a file, perhaps

install.packages(file.choose(), repos=NULL)

Well, yes (and we know that because of the non-standard tarballs those 
systems produce by default and which R CMD build now works around).

But my observation was based on the fact that everyone I know who develops 
on Mac OS X (and almost everyone on Windows) builds R from the sources to 
suit their own preferences (and since that will be for the one 
architecture they are working on and sub-architectures are not the 
default), such people don't have sub-architectures.  It's not just Mac OS: 
I have 32- and 64-bit versions on Linux and Solaris, but I keep them 
separate for development (and e.g. RH/Fedora has gone a different route 
for multi-architecture support that is tantamount to separate installs 
with a common front-end script).

>> If you submit a tested patch it is more likely to be 'addressed' once
>> the R-2-8-branch is open again.

I think this is probably covered in changes now made in R-devel, but 
please do check for us.

Two comments: first, not everyone has accesss to the CRAN or other 
depositories for direct installation.

That's my case, given my parent company's mad paranoia about internet 
access.

Second,  is it possible the people who are having trouble with the 
installer are not selecting the correct directory?  I had to play around 
a bit when installing from a package I'd previously downloaded and 
unzipped.  I think I finally figured out that I had to select the 
sub-folder titled "R" or something like that to get the installer to 
load the package.

everything worked fine-  2.8.0 is installed fine, but I don't know how
to get it to work with R ...
this works and launches 2.7.2 -- do I simply make a new symbolic link
to the new installation or... ?
also I have EMACS and would like it to work with x11 I can set the
display with Sys.setenv(DISPLAY=":0.0") to get x11 up an running.  How
can I get this to work without having to type this in every time?
.Rprofile?  I have tried adding the previous line, but I can not get
it to work.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.

I think all this lacks is ibook G4 256 RAM
os x 10.3.9

thanks

That's not a problem -- the build script builds 2 versions of some 
files, and the first time through they don't exist, so you get that 
error, which is ignored.

The problem is with the Freetype library, which is being detected at 
build time but which is not available at run time.  All I can say is 
that it works for me, I don't know why it doesn't work for you.  (I'm on 
OS X 10.4.11, you're probably on 10.5?)  You can try to configure rgl 
without Freetype by using --disable-ftgl as a configure option, i.e.

R CMD INSTALL --configure-args=--disable-ftgl ...

but I don't know how to get it to work.

I've copied this to R-sig-mac; maybe someone there can suggest a fix.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] a question regarding Leopard and gfortran
Message-ID: <CCFB3B28-12E3-4C33-8FD9-8AB03FA63E08@stat.berkeley.edu>

Thanks to Simon for all the work on the compilers.

I can see that the compilers and instructions have been updated on the  
"tools" page (r.research.att.com/tools). It seems as if the  
recommended way for us Leopard users is to use

gcc 4.2 (Apple Inc. build 5564) for Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger): (updated  
2008/09/16)

in order to get a gfortran.

Unfortunately, unlike earlier gfortrans, this one also overwrites the  
Xcode GCC (although it seems as if it is the same exact version) and  
does not come with a gfortran-uninstall script. Personally I am a bit  
hesitant to do this, I vastly prefer the old style with a separate  
gfortran and an uninstall script. Is there any chance we will get  
this? Or should I be using gfortran 4.2.3 anyway?

Small comments on the page
1) the comment on Xcode 3.1 under Leopard CRAN seems a bit odd. When I  
run the Xcode 3.1 installer I do not really have an option of  
(de)selecting 4.2 separately.
2) I cannot find the gcc_select script mentioned under alternative  
compilers in my installation. I know I used to have it under Tiger to  
switch between gcc 3 and 4, but it is absent on my machine

Thanks, Kasper

Thanks - it's a small yet fatal bug (essentially a missing ".") that  
strangely no one reported in the beta/RC stage. The easiest work- 
around for now is to add
options(pkgType="mac.binary.universal")
to one of your startup scripts - e.g. just add it to
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.8/Resources/library/base/R/ 
Rprofile
if you are an admin, otherwise add it to your .Rprofile
The bug should not affect Leopard binaries. I shall post a fix on CRAN  
soon.

Cheers,
Simon

@David, please be more precise when asking such questions - I had no  
idea what you're taking about until Leonard's post.

Sorry. I'll try to be more precise. I thought I was contributing to  
the same discussion by others from reading the headers, but not the  
contents. I'll be more detailed next time.

Thank you for fixing.

No, on Leopard you should get the gfortran-4.2 for Leopard. That keeps  
your Xcode gcc intact. Unfortunately the PackageManager is a bit  
broken, so the packaged version is still 5531, but there is also a  
5564 version based in GNU Fortran 4.2.4 at
http://r.research.att.com/gfortran-4.2-5564-darwin9.tar.gz
it requires Xcode 3.1 to work. I'm currently building the Leopard  
release which will include that compiler.

Ok, thanks, point taken, gcc-4.2 is on by default now which I didn't  
notice.

... in which case you clearly cannot use it ;) That's why I mentioned  
it as one of the alternatives. It will be present if you installed the  
10.3 SDK on Leopard and it works just fine with gcc-4.2.

Simon

Mine is also Leopard Binary. All recent updates applied.
Your fix also doesn't work after I pasted you code into my Rprofile  
file. I won't supply more details until I'm confident I know how to  
use the .Rprofile. I don't use it currently.

Dear list,

after having installed R-2.8.0 on Mac OS 10.4.11, I get an error  
message when I try to install the source of a package (please see  
below). I was trying to find a solution on the web, but my  
understanding of the architecture of Mac OS is to weak to make  
something out of the hints I found. Can someone point me towards an  
easy-understandable solution to the problem? What do I have to change  
exactly and how can I do it?

Thank you in advance!

Christoph,

please make sure you have:
- Xcode 2.4 or higher installed (2.5 recommended)
- you are using Apple's compilers
- MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET is not explicitly set (e.g. try  
Sys.getenv("MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET"))

If all the above is true, please send me the output in Terminal:
which gcc
gcc --version

then try
Sys.setenv("MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET"="10.4")
before installing a package from source.

Thanks,
Simon

Again, zero information provided so all I can do is speculate. I  
suspect that you're using the Package Installer in the GUI in which  
case the work-around won't work as the PM is forcing "mac.binary"  
regardless of the option.

You have two choices - wait for CRAN to update (may take sometime till  
tomorrow) or use update.packages() directly without the Package Manager.

Cheers,
Simon

I am sure that this doesn't help, but I just compiled 2.8.0 from
source on a ibook g4 os x 10.3.9

./configure -without--aqua
make
sudo make install

I sucessfully installed gee with

install.packages("gee", dependencies=TRUE)

This might have something to do with what Word is willing to accept.
With Mac OS 10.5.5, R 2.7.2, GUI 1.25 (5217), I can say

   plot(1:10, 1:10, type="l")

R opens a quartz window and displays the line plot.  From there I can
copy the plot to the clipboard (via Cmd-C or Edit > Copy); after the
copy, I'll switch to Preview.app and press Cmd-N ("New from
clipboard") within Preview; Preview creates a new pdf document with
the plot.

Perhaps word doesn't handle pasting of pdf data?

   plot(1:10, 1:10, type="l")
   quartz.save("foo.png");
   quartz.save("foo.pdf", type="pdf");

After running these three commands, you should have a pdf named
"foo.pdf" and a png named "foo.png".

HTH.

We will, as soon as our builds are up and running with R-2.9 on macosx.
I'll post again here to confirm.

It is a bug, and I assume that from Simon's message he has it fixed  
and it will appear on CRAN in a day or two. Maybe earlier at http://R.research.att.com/

For the meantime, you can either:
1. Go back to 2.7.2
2. Download the packages as binaries directly from CRAN and install  
using the Package Installer
3. Install from the command line.
4. Install from Source using the Package Installer if you have XCode  
installed.
5. Go hiking.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] R 2.8.0 release for Mac OS X 10.4 - (update!)
Message-ID: <D49C42F1-7E3A-4243-8ACB-1515CA6B911D@r-project.org>

R 2.8.0 for Mac OS X 10.4 was released today, 2008/10/22.

** Important note **

Although binaries have been posted yesterday (2008/10/21), they were  
incomplete (and contained a bug).
Before downloading make sure you are getting the correct, updated  
binaries from today:
1) the CRAN website you are downloading from should say "Important  
note - R 2.8.0 binaries have been updated 2008/10/22"
2) check the MD5 sums of the downloaded images (if they start with "e"  
or "4" then they are old!)

If either of the above is not true, do NOT download that image -  
change the mirror and/or wait until your mirror gets updated.

MD5 checksums:
MD5(R-2.8.0.dmg)= 929bc879c0ab2fe8b1ca514c796e8fa1
MD5(R-2.8.0-mini.dmg)= b6f2b5ddb279266090e27d525e528d6a

verify in Terminal with
md5 R-2.8.0.dmg
or
md5 R-2.8.0-mini.dmg

At any rate it is advisable to wait a day or so until both R binaries  
and all binary packages have been propagated to the mirrors.

Cheers,
Simon

Just a followup.  With the updated CRAN R 2.8.0 binaries,
and installing the binary builds of the packages, all works
fine again.  I'd still like to track down the source of
the problem discussed at the beginning of this thread (at
the bottom of this mail), if anyone has some suggestions,
however.

Thank you.

Dear Simon,

If I understand you correctly, this means that leopard users wanting  
to compile R themselves either a) stick with the pre-leopard  
instructions (Xcode 2.4 based) or b) somehow (how?) obtain the 10.3  
SDK so as to have the convenience of the gcc_select script or c)  
symlink to the gcc 4.2 binaries (how?)

Thank you very  much for all your efforts for the Mac R community, it  
is just that for some months now (since Xcode 3.1 was released) that I  
would like to try the new gcc for building R, but I am stuck with 4.0.1

kind regards,

Ivan

Ken,

I didn't follow the earlier discussion, but I can suggest why it works  
in R 2.8.0 :). For R 2.8.0 we now use an updated (static) freetype in  
R. On the CRAN build machine it has higher precedence than Apple's  
freetype, so that's what rgl binary ends up using.
But then, I didn't see any problems before so it's hard to tell...

Cheers,
S

That is likely a bug in whatever program you're pasting it in as it  
doesn't handle transparency properly (by default the plot is painted  
on a transparent background so it's easier to adapt it to your style  
in Keynote etc.). I was checking with Adobe CS2 and it works without  
problems, so I suspect your application is simply too old to handle  
that. You don't need to use Preview, you can paste straight from  
Quartz without problems.

There is no such thing as "higher quality PDFs". All PDFs contain the  
plot as-is (whether you use copy/paste, quartz PDF output or pdf  
device). What you probably mean is high quality PNG (bitmap) images.  
Those can be created with quartz.save by specifying the target  
resolution such as:
quartz.save("foo.png",dpi=300)
However, that is not what you want to use for publications.

Note that MS products cannot handle PDF (definitely not on the Windows  
side), so you cannot use PDF there (which is really stupid, but that's  
another story). That's why you may prefer higher-resolution PNG if the  
document is to be shared with Windows people.

Can you, please, share with use the code to reproduce this so we can  
check it?

I cannot reproduce it. With exactly the same setup as above I can  
install arbitrarily many packages. Note that it may take a while, but  
they will install.

Same again - it works for me without problems, the list gets updated  
as soon as all packages are installed.


>  I need to quit R and re-start to get the updates.

You don't. If you have many packages to install, you need some  
patience (the amount of patience necessary also depends on the speed  
of your internet connection and the mirror), but it works as  
advertized for me.


> What's going on?

We have some great colors to enjoy since the fall came gracefully, but  
why would you want to know? ;)

Cheers,
Simon

Dear Simon, dear Stephen,

thanks a lot for taking your time and your advice.

Sys.setenv("MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET"="10.4") works perfect.

Kind regards,
Christoph

After upgrading R from version 2.7.2 to 2.8.0, I have trouble loading library 'gsl' as shown below. What is missing?

Thanks,

GNU Scientific Library. We don't have GSL on the CRAN machine and  
somehow some version of the gsl package managed to slip through  
without passing check. I have added GSL to the CRAN machine today, so  
there should be working gsl package binary on CRAN soon.

Thanks,
Simon

I recently changed from a 4 year old Dell running on Windows XP to a  
mew MacBook Pro running on OS X 10.5. I expected to save an amount of  
runtime when executing my R code now, but I was mistaken.

I didn't figure out what the problem could be! Same code is running  
about 30% (!) slower now!

Any suggestions?

N.R.

Hi Nils,

try R from the terminal with X11 graphics instead of R.app. I've noticed 
it is often much faster, also for non-graphics stuff.

cheers

What about sharing the code with us? There is very little we can say  
unless you share the code with us as well as the exact machine specs  
(and compare the same version of R).

Well, the only special thing about it is that it's pure interpreted  
code so it cannot take advantage of anything in R.
However, I'm surprised about your timings - are you sure you're not  
throttling the CPU? See the energy savings preferences - it seems as  
if you're running in a battery saving mode so the CPU is at half its  
speed. This is what I get:

mini, Intel Code 1.66GHz (so much slower than yours):
    user  system elapsed
  15.321   0.123  15.764

iMac, Intel Core 2 Duo 2.8GHz (a bit faster than yours):
    user  system elapsed
   8.602   0.067   8.708

Given the kind of code, you cannot expect any magic, because it  
doesn't use memory or multiple cores, so even the most recent,  
expensive machines won't be much faster. Raw clock speed is what  
matters here (whether old Pentium or latest Xeon won't matter  
much ;)). Given the results above, I'd expect your machine to clock  
somewhere around 10s. I have compared it to other OSes and the results  
are consistent ...

Cheers,
Simon

Thanks for your replies.

There's nothing special about my code (I guess), but here it is.


indexGenerator <-  
function(mue,sigma,duration,numOfSimulations,timeStep =  
1/252,nameBasis="Index"){

     m   <- mue
     s   <- sigma
     T   <- duration
     dt  <- timeStep
     n   <- numOfSimulations

     # dataMatrix contains n simulations over T+1 years (from 0 to T)
     dataMatrix      <- matrix(1,nrow=n,ncol=T+1)

     YearEndIndex    <- seq(1:T)/dt + 1

     PTIME <- proc.time()
     for(i in 1:n){

         Index_all   <- seq(0,T,by=dt) + 1
         Index_YE    <- seq(1:(T+1))
         time        <- seq(0,T,by=dt)

         ZFZ <- rnorm(length(Index_all)-1,0,1)

         for(t in 2:length(Index_all)){
             Index_all[t] <- Index_all[t-1] + m*Index_all[t-1]*dt +  
s*Index_all[t-1]*sqrt(dt)*ZFZ[t-1]
         }

         print(paste("Simulation",i,"of",n,"done."),quote=FALSE)
         dataMatrix[i,2:(T+1)] <- t(Index_all[YearEndIndex])
     }

     tableName <- "dummy"
     write.table(dataMatrix,tableName,sep = ";")

     print(proc.time()-PTIME)
}


Without running any other program in the background yields (on my Mac)

I figured out that the function can be made faster by rewriting the  
code but this doesn't answer my question why my MacBook is slower.  
Here some specifications:

	Modell-Identifizierung:	MacBookPro4,1
   	Prozessortyp:	Intel Core 2 Duo
   	Prozessorgeschwindigkeit:	2.4 GHz
   	Anzahl der Prozessoren:	1
   	Gesamtzahl der Kerne:	2
   	L2-Cache:	3 MB
   	Speicher:	2 GB
	Systemversion:	Mac OS X 10.5.5 (9F33)
   	Kernel-Version:	Darwin 9.5.0

Before I used a Dell Inspirion 510, running on Windows XP with a 1.7  
GHz processor and some lousy 512 MB RAM.

The R-version in use is 2.8.o

Cheers,
Nils

A 2.6 MacBook Pro, 2G, just to check differences between R and R.app.
Not completely fair, R.app runs in 64 bit, R in Terminal in 32 bit.

Stiil, always interesting to check now and then.

I did do some other work during this last run in the Terminal.
In fact TimeMachine kicked in and I read some more email.

I have a 1 year old iMac 2 Ghz. The  indexGenerator(0.08,0.15,30,1000)  
call takes about 121s in . For comparison I ran the Windows version  
under Parallels and it also takes about 120s.

I think you have a sick MacBook, look for a benchmarking program  
(maybe geekBench) and compare against others, or contact your Apple  
dealer and see what they suggest.

Yes, if your energy settings are to save battery as I said in the  
original reply. You can choose which mode you want to use (from  
battery saving to best performance - and you can even create a custom  
mode), so it's up to you whether you want battery life or fast  
benchmarks ;). Note that the settings are customizable for both batter  
and adapter power.

Actually, it's the difference between:

Laptop plugged in, battery in:
 >indexGenerator(0.08,0.15,30,100)
    user  system elapsed
  12.051   0.193  13.365

Laptop plugged in, battery out:
 >indexGenerator(0.08,0.15,30,100)
    user  system elapsed
  25.507   0.503  27.368

This is with a 2.16GHz MacBook Pro.

So it should fall under the "Power adapter" energy saving in both cases. 
  Does anyone know why it should run slower without the battery?

Loren,

those seem to come from the system, not from R.app itself. R.app is  
simply relaying any output on stderr that it encounters. Given that  
the output seems to be also produced by Apple's own applications, it  
is likely benign and a possibly bug in the OS. Most applications don't  
relay stderr so the output lands only in the system log, so that's  
maybe why it wasn't fixed yet. You can mute stderr if you wish (see  
FAQ 12.4).

Cheers,
Simon

This sounded a bit strange to me since the adapter can power the laptop 
& charge the battery at the same time. Doing a bit more digging, it 
turns out to be correct.

http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2332 gives the official explanation.

Message-ID: <B91EE28B-3330-4C04-9D00-EA6434EF747C@gmx.de>

Hi,

till now, I just work with the normal R environment.
But there are some issues that disturb me working with the normal R  
console.
I heard about alternative ways to work with R, like text editors which  
are able to communicate with R.


What I am looking for is a way to seperate the output from the input.

I think the best way would be to have two or three frames in one window.
One frame for the output, one for the input and one for just editing  
text (perhaps with R-language highlighting).


Is there a way to realize that kind of working environment?
And if yes, what do I need to realize that (software, preferences etc.)?



I tried Aquamacs Emacs.
I can start R in Emacs with ESS but I didn't found a way to seperate  
what I type in from what I get from R as output in the way I would  
like it to be...

You can split an emacs frame window into several windows with e.g.
C-x 2   (splits window horizontally)
C-x 3   (splits window vertically)
Then you can write your code in one buffer, and submit it to
the running R session in another buffer via
C-n
on a given line of R code
C-r submits a region of code etc.

However, the R inputs and outputs both show in the R session
buffer.  (Perhaps some ESS guru knows how to make the
R buffer show output only?)

One nice thing about the R session in an emacs buffer is
that you can edit it too, so if you evaluate something
inappropriate you can delete it from the R session window
with standard Emacs editing commands.




Here's some example Emacs commands to help automate setting up
a divided frame (put these into your .emacs file or 
into an emacs lisp file that you can load when needed)
;;; -------------------------------------------------------------
;;; Commands to set up windows useful for R script processing.
(modify-frame-parameters
   (selected-frame)
   '((width . 232) (height . 56) (top . 0) (left . 64) ))      

(split-window-horizontally -88)
(split-window-vertically)

JGR does exactly that
http://www.rforge.net/JGR/

It has separate input and output + you can open arbitrarily many  
editor windows where you can use <CMD><Enter> to execute selection etc.

Although you can do the same in R GUI, the GUI doesn't split input and  
output console - however, you can still execute lines/selection from  
the integrated editor window...

Cheers,
Simon

Hi,
I noticed  something tricky about setting a palette.  If I set up a 
palette, e.g.

 >  palette(rainbow(10))

then plot something, and then revert my working environment,

 >palette(default)

The quartz window does not change, nor does it change if I drag it 
around the desktop.  But if I resize the window, the graph will redraw 
using the current palette, not the one used to create it.


Would it make more sense for the window management tools to 'remember' 
the palette used to draw the window?

Or would it make more sense for me to learn proper use of environments :-) ?

Thanks for all your replies.

I now know what made the difference (but still can't believe it!!!).  
Before I was running with the mains adapter only whereas the battery  
was removed. If the battery is inserted and the adapter is connected  
the runtime decreases "dramatically" even on my MacBook.

Battery INSERTED:
indexGenerator(0.08,0.15,30,100): 10.242
indexGenerator(0.08,0.15,30,1000): 100.875

Battery REMOVED:
indexGenerator(0.08,0.15,30,100): 19.779
indexGenerator(0.08,0.15,30,1000): 197.375

Would anyone have expected that? Sorry, but me I wouldn't.

Cheers,
Nils

Ok, I give up

I am exploring some workspace files created long long ago
And need the creation date of some of the files

I try ls() but cannot see the parameters to show creation date
I try file.info and get NA
How do I get creation date to show

Thank you

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Problem with libR.dylib in 2.8.0
Message-ID: <C52DD950.5B7B%c.lokan@adfa.edu.au>

After installing 2.8.0, I am unable to load some packages. I have installed
them successfully with R CMD INSTALL, but can't load them into R.

For example:

> library("Cairo")
Error in dyn.load(file, DLLpath = DLLpath, ...) :
  unable to load shared library
'/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.8/Resources/library/Cairo/libs/i
386/Cairo.so':
  
dlopen(/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.8/Resources/library/Cairo/
libs/i386/Cairo.so, 6): Library not loaded:
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.7/Resources/lib/libR.dylib
  Referenced from: 
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.8/Resources/library/Cairo/libs/i3
86/Cairo.so
  Reason: image not found
Error : .onLoad failed in 'loadNamespace' for 'Cairo'
Error: package/namespace load failed for 'Cairo'

Where can I find libR.dylib? Or is there another way around this?

I am running MacOS X 10.4.11. I checked the md5 hash for R-2.8.0.dmg after
downloading it, and the value was correct.

Chris

You are likely trying to load a R 2.7.x package in R 2.8.0. Look at  
the paths above. Make sure you have removed packages from previous R  
versions and/or you are not using hard-coded paths to user libraries.  
Also I would strongly recommend using CRAN builds of packages  
especially with packages with library dependencies like Cairo.

Cheers,
Simon

One way is to navigate to the file via the Finder, select it, and hit  
Cmd-I (File > Get Info)

You'll find what you're looking for in the "General" section.

Sorry my email was unclear
I am looking at files within a saved R workspace

The date of the workspace file is 3/18/2007 but I don't think all of the
files were created on that date as I think I used the workspace over some
period of time

So I would like the creation date of the files WITHIN the workspace

Maybe I should be asking this on the R email list

Message-ID: <C52E0BE0.5B9F%c.lokan@adfa.edu.au>

I found a work-around.

I re-installed everything from scratch, with MacOS X binaries downloaded
today from CRAN for R-2.8.0.dmg and for all the libraries I need.

Same problem: some of the libraries (chron, Cairo, Design, Hmisc) expect to
find libR.dylib in a directory called
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.7/Resources/lib/

I have not done any hard-coding of anything myself, so I assume the
hard-coded path must be in the libraries themselves somehow.

The work-around: I created that directory structure by hand, and linked
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Libraries/libR.dylib into it. Now things
seem to be working.

Yes, you have the wrong binaries!! You have binaries for R 2.7 but you  
need binaries for R 2.8.
I can only repeat that over and over again. Get binaries for R 2.8.0!  
They are in

http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/universal/contrib/2.8/

(replace the host with your mirror if you wish, but make sure there is  
2.8 in the URL!)
The most reliable way is to use install.packages to fetch them, but if  
you have to fetch them manually, make sure you get the right ones!

Do NOT do that! R 2.7 and R 2.8 are NOT binary compatible. Most  
symbols will be fine, but some won't. You simply have the wrong  
binaries - again 2.7 binaries are NOT meant to be used with R 2.8.0.

Simon

Sorry to exasperate you!

As you pointed out, the version numbers in the error messages showed that
something was wrong about the binaries. My problem was that I assumed that
clicking through from the main CRAN packages page would lead me to the
correct binaries.

Rather than
http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/universal/contrib/2.8/
Clicking through from http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ leads to files
contained in 
http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/universal/contrib/r-release/

I've got the correct ones now, and fixed up the corrupted structure I have
created for myself. All is well.

Many thanks for your help.

Chris

Hi Loren,

Try the following.  You need to have XCode developer tools installed.  Assumes that you working directory is where the files of interest are.  Otherwise add a path to the ls command.



files <- system("ls",intern=T)

date <- vector(mode="character",length=length(files))

names(date) <- files

for (f in files) {
	date[f] <- system(paste("/Developer/Tools/GetFileInfo -d '",f,"'",sep=""), intern=T)
	}

There is no file *within* the workspace. The workspace *is* one file  
of serialized R objects and they themselves don't have any timestamp  
associated with them. So all you can find out is when you last saved  
(or accessed) the workspace, that's all.

Cheers,
S

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] RGtk2 on Mac -- problems installing...
Message-ID: <4908C0CB.5020206@ucdavis.edu>

Hi all:

	I've got R 2.8.0 on MacOS X 10.4.11, and I'm trying to get RGtk2 
working so I can use some other libaries that require it.  When 
installing it normally, it asks me if I want to install the GTK runtime, 
which downloads but then fails to install.  I manually downloaded the 
GTK runtime installer from http://r.research.att.com/, which installed 
fine, but R doesn't seem to "see" it (it continues to ask me if I want 
to install GTK when trying to load the libary).  Any tricks to getting 
this to work?  I feel like there might be an environment variable 
missing someplace, but I have no idea what the variable is nor how to 
define it permanently for R.

	I should point out I've tried this under both the Cocoa GUI and the X11 
gui, same error.  Thanks!  Besides this little hiccup, I'm very happy 
with the Mac port of R...

The GTK+ binary for R 2.8.0 has been updated and it uses a different  
location to prevent messing up other packages. That makes it  
incompatible with the old GTK used for R 2.7.2 and earlier. The new  
binary  is available from

http://r.research.att.com/libs/

To install paste in Terminal:

curl -s http://r.research.att.com/libs/GTK+_2.14.3-X11-darwin8-bin2.tar.gz 
  \
| sudo tar fvxz - -C /

There should be a proper package installer shortly, I was just waiting  
for some feedback from selected developers first.

Cheers,
Simon

Excellent!  And just to confirm -- this will only work within the X11 
environment, not the Cocoa/Quartz GUI, right?

It works just fine with the GUI, but the windows it's creating will  
use X11, not native Cocoa. The native version of GTK+ is unfortunately  
not stable enough yet.

Oops; clearly I didn't understand the question.  I thought Loren needed creation date on files in a directory. Thanks for clearing it up Simon.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] [R-gui] RExcel and Rcmdr view/edit buttons
Message-ID: <49097432.5040506@univie.ac.at>

Simple Answer:
You can start Rcmdr from Excel in a way it keeps all its menus
and buttons on its own window.

RExcel -> RCommander -> with separate menus does that.

(You have to use RExcel -> Start R) to get the RCommander submenu.

More complex answer:

Do you know that when you right click in a cell in Excel, you can
immediately transfer a dataframe between Excel and R in both directions?
So to edit a dataframe:
create a new worksheet,
right click in the upper left cell,
Use Get Dataframe,
change what you want to change
press ctrl-shft-return (selecting the whole dataframe)
rightclick and use Put Dataframe

There is no need at all to use .csv when transferring data between R and
Excel.
In fact that is one of the reasons I wrote RExcel!

Please have a look at the demo workbooks in RExcel, especially the one
aboout Data transfer.

Following execution of the following code, the second "infinity" appears

is fine.  When plotting to a quartz window, both infinity symbols are

Yes, it is specific to you (or some Macs).  I'm not sitting in front of my 
iMac, but when it displays on my Linux box, the result is fine.

There are several variants of x11(): I am assuming this is the CRAN build 
and type="cairo"?  I tested the latter (and my self-build), and it should 
be rendering on the Mac so the actual X server would be irrelevant.  My 
test was for 10.5.5, though.

Too bad there's not a Mac compatible version. This sounds like a great  
tool for data manipulation and management.

Since you asked for it ;-)
We do have a prerelease version of ROOo
(R in OpenOffice.org) which offers the same functionality.
It still has some rough edges an no documentation deserving that name.
You can download the latest version from
http://rcom.univie.ac.at/download/ROOo/ROOo20081015-1.zip
The zip file has instructions on how to install.

It works identically on OSX, Linux, and Windows.

More information about the progress of the project is available at

That's great news! Thanks for this excellent work. I will try to carve  
some time out to test this soon.

Have you tried to install it from source- he asks for help in finding
configuration settings for users of matlab under other operating
systems...  You could send him an email.  Good Luck.

Thank you

That is too bad as date time of work is important

But, going forward, maybe I can learn how to set the date time in the
objects attributes when it is important

Like I found a discussion on this topic from 2004 which suggests
 attr(obj, "timestamp") <- Sys.time()
And then
 attr(obj, "timestamp")

So I tried
 attr(obj, "datetime") <- date()
Then
 attr(obj,"datetime")

And it works so I can do that

But then as I read the ref manual,
file.info tries to show mtime, ctime and atime
But I guess that does not apply to objects within a workspace

Loren, the easiest solution to your problem is to save objects in  
individual files, like

save(BigComputation, file = "BigComputation.rda")

that way you just have one object in each file and can use the file  
time stamp.

Using attributes are of course another approach.
