A while ago I mentioned not being able to alter the default position 
of the quartz window, but I didn't see any response. Is there any 
chance of fixing it?

Thanks,
Tim

There's no problem there... it was simply a *warning* and the package  
you wanted was downloaded and installed.

I understand it may be annoying to see warning msgs, but what you  
wanted to do was accomplished.

These messages have been showing up for several months when starting  
R.app (64-bit only) from the 'outside', e.g. through AppleScript from  
an editor. Simon pointed this out back in April.

The good news is that (on my system at least) the messages are gone in  
SnowLeopard!

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Remove devpack4 files
Message-ID: <has4ip$932$1@ger.gmane.org>

Dear all,

I install development binaries from devpack4 using the command as follows:

curl -s 
http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools/devpack4-darwin8-bin4.tar.gz 
| sudo tar fvxz --overwrite -C

Is there any simple solution to remove all installed files or should I 
do it manually (file by file)?

Thank you in advance for any suggestions.

Best, Andrej

You can do something like:

sudo bash
files=`tar fvtz devpack4-darwin8-bin4.tar.gz | awk '{print "/"$9}' |   
perl  -e 'print reverse <>'`
rm -f $files 2>/dev/null
rmdir $files 2>/dev/null

Message-ID: <C1C7DD6C-064F-4D19-8F73-AE80B651EE85@illinois.edu>

I am trying to install R-alpha R-2.10.0 (yesterdays version) on a mac  
pro system that I've
recently upgraded to SL and xcode 3.2.   I've tried both the binary  
install which fails, and
building from source:  the config.log file can be seen here:

http://www.econ.uiuc.edu/~roger/config.log

Version 2.9.2 built from sources without problems after the SL  
upgrade.... which I
took as a good omen for the general sanity of the system, but  
apparently this was
a mistake.

I presume that this has something to do with conflicts with old  
gfortrans.  I've installed
gfortran 4.2.3 but perhaps there are remnants of older versions still  
hanging around?
Many thanks for any hints,

Roger

Simon,

I read this thread,
https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-mac/2009-September/006463.html

but didn't see this post:

https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-mac/2009-September/006470.html

Unfortunately,  I can't get this to work either, the configure step  
seems to
end normally, although there is a warning about "missing packages. but

make -j8 && make install

ends with error:  cannot use Fortran.  But
yzzy: which gfortran /usr/local/bin/gfortran yzzy:
gfortran --version

As for the binary install,  the pkg installer produced eventually
a window that said "Failed"   in red rather than the usual green
Installation Successful  -- but it wasn't clear where to look
for the entrails.  I've replaced the old config.log on the web
with the new one based on the recommended configure lines.

Roger,

from your logs you are still using the wrong compilers (missing -arch  
flags) and not following the instructions (you're building in the  
sources as far as I can tell). Please make sure you're setting FC and  
F77 correctly including the -arch flag and don't build in the sources.  
If in doubt, please send us the exact configure line you're using.  
(And make sure you remove everything in the build directory before re- 
trying).

Cheers,
Simon

I'll have to check, on SL you may need to specify /usr/X11 -- the  
autodetection sometimes doesn't work, but I' don't remember what rgl  
uses... I'll check it out later (the build machine is still 10.5 so  
the binaries should not be affected).

Thanks,
Simon

Thanks Simon.  Starting with a fresh source directory and building
one level up from the source did indeed resolve everything just as

My usual set of packages also installed fine except for rgl once I  
realized that I need

Dear all,

I am currently configuring a Mac Pro running SL.

https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-mac/2009-September/006468.html

suggests there are issues with Fink.

I am familiar with building R packages but I have never built R
from source (this might change, however). Question: any strong
opinions re Fink vs MacPorts? Or other solutions? (I have been using
Fink on my laptop for some time without problems but then I never built R
from source.)

Thank you in advance for any suggestions.

Best,
Christian Kleiber

There are issues with Fink if you try to mix Fink and native system  
(see below), but that's also true for MacPorts.

This doesn't answer your question, but why wouldn't you use the  
released R binaries?

Both MacPorts and Fink are causing trouble by design because they are  
installing a parallel system to the actual OS and use overrides to  
bypass the original system. Some people like that because they simply  
want a different system on their machine, but as soon as you use  
anything that's not in that system (without disabling Fink/MacPorts)  
or try to mix them, you run into issues. I didn't check recently, but  
MacPorts used to have issues with R because people creating the ports  
had no idea about either R or Macs, but that may have (hopefully)  
changed in the meantime.


> Question: any strong
> opinions re Fink vs MacPorts? Or other solutions?


Solutions? It depends on what is your problem ;). Personally I don't  
use Fink since OS 10.4 because that's when almost everything became  
available in native form. Fink was needed in the beginning because  
very little was ported to Mac OS X but that has changed dramatically  
since. Still, there are big beasts (such as KDE) that are not  
available otherwise, but then you're not really use Mac OS at all :).

Cheers,
Simon

Because you want the very latest patches, or you want different 
configure options ....

I build R on my Macs (L and SL) all the time from the sources, and 
have neither Fink nor MacPorts installed.  If you want your builds to 
be compatible with the CRAN/r.research.att.com builds of packages you 
need to set up the configure options carefully and be careful what you 
have in /usr/local/lib, but it can be done.  (I'm not going to give 
the recipe here, as it does change from time to time and these lists 
are archived -- I have had too many emails which say 'your posting was 
wrong' when it was correct in 2007 or 2004 or 1999 ....)

Hi Christian,

Unless you are doing development with R I would second Simon's
suggestion to use the pre-packaged R binary.

I have had better experiences with MacPorts vs Fink, although both
have a tendency to pull in large sets of dependencies for libraries
and tools that are already on your Mac.

Recently, I've been using Homebrew [1] as an alternative.  Yes, it is
yet another package manager.  One of its aims is to avoid duplicating
libs that are already on a modern Mac.

Just to clarify -- I wasn't questioning building R from sources -- I  
was questioning why anyone would use Fink or MacPorts R binary since  
you lose the advantage of control over the build and yet you get a  
much more limited binary than the one from CRAN and you can't use CRAN  
package binaries, either.

Thank, Seth, I really like the Homebrew approach -- the real problem  
with MacPorts/Fink is that they mess up the system (if you use them)  
so Homebrew takes that out of the equation. I'll test it for a bit and  
see if we can even recommended that since it complements the binaries  
we provide ...

Thanks,
Simon

for what matters, I totally second Simon view (and experience)

Simon,

just to clarify: I always use the CRAN binaries, now also your 64-bit  
builds. So I infer that package managers are nowadays best avoided on  
Mac OS. I used Fink for non-R stuff, installing subversion etc, but  
apparently that can be avoided too. I was also unaware of Homebrew but  
then I prefer wine themes myself.

Thanks to all respondents,
Christian

I have been running fink on my home machine for years, and I've been  
running Macports on my work machine for a few months now. I have to  
run Macports at work because our firewall blocks many of the URLs for  
fink's source repositories.

In my experience so far, fink has been much more elegant and more  
graceful to use. It is operated by a large group of enthusiasts many  
of whom happen to be scientists. So, there is a greater emphasis on  
functionality and good support, especially for scientists.

However, Macports seems to provide packages that are perhaps prettier.  
For example, the Gnome packages on Macports are built with many  
additional xorg GUI libraries, so they tend to look sharper than those  
built via fink. (I base this on pan running on both computers.)

On the whole, I highly recommend fink over macports. The package  
managers are more responsive. The packages are made to be robust, and  
they adhere very strictly to the philosophy that the fink distribution  
does not interfere AT ALL with the OS X system. So, if you ever want  
to remove the fink subsystem, you simply execute
sudo rm -rf /sw
and you're done. Macports does tend to override certain OS X core  
functions, to my understanding.

As of now, I'm having a much easier time building packages on fink  
than I am on macports on Snow Leopard using the x86_64 tree.

KDE is broken on both fink and macports at the moment, but both  
distributions offer native KDE integration. I'm waiting for KDE 4.3 to  
be released so that I can run KDE applications inside quartz. (See  
amarok2-mac in the fink pacakges.) So, the native OS X look is coming  
to both Gnome and KDE.

All of that said, you're much better off using the R binaries  
distributed by the R-Foundation. First, you are far more likely to get  
a more recent package (fink tree is still at 2.7.0 http://pdb.finkproject.org/pdb/package.php/r-base 
) with R.app included. Fink doesn't include the GUI.

The macports distribution of R seems to be up to date,
http://trac.macports.org/browser/trunk/dports/math/R/Portfile
but it's hard to tell if it includes the GUI.

So, build R yourself only if you have the time and idle processors. :)

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] link a shared library of a r-package
Message-ID: <9DCFEC1C-859B-4661-BBC6-E601140F05E5@env.ethz.ch>

Dear list

I wrote some c-code and would like to link it with the shared library  
RandomFields.so of the
RandomFields package.

I tried it in the following way

gcc -lRandomFields -L/directory of RandomFields.so -o prog my_c_code.c

and I got the following error

ld: library not found for -lRandomFields
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status


Thus my question: Is it possible to link a shared library (created  
inside an R-package) with so c-code.

I am not sure if this is the right list but I am working with Mac OS X  
10.6.



Regards


Christoph

Denis,

Here's a script I wrote several years ago for dealing with
various Bioconductor GUIs that needed BWidget and Tktable
(which are Tcl Extension packages). Like browser plug-ins,
they add functionality not included in the base Tcl/Tk.

You will have to modify it to handle SnowLeopard yourself;
I have no access to 10.6 for testing it myself. Runs fine
on Tiger and Leopard for me.

That's something you cannot do in general, because installed packages  
are just shared objects, not necessarily dynamic libraries (in fact  
some older versions of R used bundles instead). R provides a facility  
for packages to expose their C-level code via R_RegisterCCallable and  
your package can use such entry points using R_GetCCallable. However,  
to my knowledge RandomForests doesn't export its entry point, so you  
cannot them from your C code. That is usually with a good reason,  
because packages are free to change their C-level entry points at any  
point without notice rendering your package useless in the process.

Your options are either to talk to the authors if some general  
abstraction is reasonable or to use the exported entry points from R  
(.C/.Call) or to take and modify their code if the license allows that.

Cheers,
Simon

James,

this look like your internet access is stalling R -- it's not really R  
freezing but your internet. Try using a different mirror and/or check  
your internet connection.

Message-ID: <e1fc21b0910141619w186dac64x16ef7c1761920eac@mail.gmail.com>

I just installed the nightly from r.research.att.com called "R 2.10.0
beta (2009-10-13)" for leopard using the pkg installer.

When I use ?plot or help(plot) the help window opens, but is blank.
And, I get this warning:

> ?plot
Warning message:
In help("plot", package = NULL) :
  htmhelp = TRUE is deprecated: use help_type ="html"

I know the help system has changed significantly in 2.10.0 and I
apologize if it is poor form to report errors such as this while the
still in the beta phase, but my reliance on these help functions has
prevented me from continuing to use the beta and test other changes.

BTW thank you for the option, in the new installer, to only install
the 64bit GUI version.

Thank you,

Peter

I can confirm the problem in a current download, which labels itself as 
2.10.0 alpha (2009-10-08 r49995), R for Mac OS X GUI 1.30-devel Leopard 
build 32-bit.

You can get to the help system by running help.start(), but internal 
requests like ?plot will still go to the internal browser, which isn't 
working.  You can work around the bug by deleting the "AQUA" section of 
utils:::print.help_files_with_topic, e.g. by doing as follows:

print.help_files_with_topic <- utils:::print.help_files_with_topic

and then deleting the lines

    if (.Platform$GUI == "AQUA") {
        .Internal(aqua.custom.print("help-files", x))
        return(invisible(x))
    }

from your copy of print.help_files_with_topic.

One other problem with the installer:  by default it installed both 32 
and 64 bit versions, but R wouldn't start until I re-installed without 
the 64 bit version.  I'm using Leopard 10.5.8 on an old Intel Core Duo 
Macbook.  Can the installer detect that 64 bit executables are not 
supported, and not install it?

To the contrary! The whole point of the beta phase is that it gets  
tested and all errors reported -- I'll look into this, thanks for the  
report.

It *is* checking the CPU and adjusting the installation accordingly,  
but there is some conflict in the automatically generated installer --  
it's not present when I create the package manually so it will need  
some more investigation...

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] tiff output on Mac
Message-ID: <b440a3f80910151008k1f931e10u7f5e9c6081c5af40@mail.gmail.com>

Dear R Mac folks,

I have not seen a thread on this so I thought I would get some input
regarding tiff output on a Mac.
I am currently running OS 10.6.1 and R 2.9.2 GUI 1.29 Tiger build 32-bit (5464).

I realize that the easiest way to save a plot is to select File, Save
As. Which outputs a .pdf file. However, if I insert this graphic into
Microsoft Word and send it to a friend on Windows the file gets
mangled (the quality is decreased significantly). So I am working on
just writing high quality tiff files which seem to display well all on
both platforms. Tiffs also seems to be one of the preferred file types
for many journals in my field.

Here are the options I have found that work on Macs.


# requires Ghostscript
bitmap(file="MacTest.tiff", type = "tifflzw",
	height = 7, width = 7, res = 600,
      units = "in")
plot(rpois(1:40,10))
dev.off()


tiff('Mactest.tiff', width = 5, height = 5, units = 'in', res = 600)
plot(rpois(1:100,1))
dev.off()

quartz(height = 7, width = 7, type = 'tiff', file = 'MacTest.tiff',bg
= 'white',dpi = 600)
hist(rpois(1:100,1))
dev.off()


hist(rpois(1:100,1))
# line are not all dark in output, not sure which tiff type to use...
dev2bitmap(file = 'MacTest.tiff', type = 'tiff24nc', height = 7, width
= 7, res = 600,
	units = 'in')


I have noticed that for bitmap and tiff the font and symbol size seems
to differ between the R session plot and the output plot.
Are there other graphic output options that I am missing here? Any
tips would be most appreciated.
Thanks in advance,
Michael

Hmm, I think you probably have pre-built html pages.  I simply don't 
see any code that will generate them, either directly or by starting 
the httpd server to do so.

I just did some quick experiments, and I get blank pages on packages 
without pre-built html, and correct ones on a package I just installed 
with 'R CMD INSTALL --html'.

Yes, that's likely. They used to be part of the installation but now  
are not. The fact that they are missing was useful to point out that I  
forgot to switch R.app from html to dynamic help (fixed now), but I  
was actually planning on keeping them installed for other software  
that relies on it (e.g. JGR). That will give those packages the chance  
to update until R 2.11.0.

Both the installer issues as well as the help should be fixed. Please  
try tonight's builds [tomorrow].

Thanks,

I am sure Simon knows this, but they are still optional (configure 
option --enable-prebuilt-html).  More seriously, they are pretty much 
untested and I've fixed a couple of non-trivial bugs today (so the 
HTML files need to be regenerated).

Also, I've just updated my checkout of the Mac-GUI project and rebuilt 
it, and whereas help() now works with dynamic help, help.search() 
still fails to find pages for packages not under the main library tree 
(print.hsearch in the Mac-GUI project needs updating).

It's your prerogative to ship prebuilt HTML pages, but they are not 
going to be shipped on Windows, and not AFAIK on Linux binary builds, 
so a fair proportion of JGR users will want an update anyway.  They 
just add to the size of the download and the vast majority of users 
will never access them.

If you look at:

?png    # you will see several other options

I will say that the advice on that page to use capabilities() to  
determine which of these options is supported seems to be at least  
misleading in that tiff comes back FALSE but the tiff device accepts  
input without complaint and produces output that Preview.app reads.

Another option, ...  handle the translation to a tiff file by using  
Preview of hte saved pdf and then the Grab.app, or just Grab the  
quartz window. That method lets me minimize the white space in the  
margins. Tiff is the saved format from Grab.

Ok, updated (it wasn't the most beautiful piece of code before and  
it's not now but it might work).

Oh, ok -- I thought we agreed to keep them in binary distributions  
until 2.11, but if Windows doesn't ship them then there is no point,  
indeed...

PNG is the format of choice these days and better supported in  
general. TIFF is more rare, but there is some support.

If you want 1:1 result of what you see in the Quartz window then the  
best way is to use quartz.save() as it maintains sizes to produce  
WYSIWYG results, e.g:

quartz.save("foo.tif","tiff",dpi=600)

Cheers,
Simon

Personally I'd actually recommend saving the graphic in whatever is the 
highest-quality format you can, then open it in GraphicConverter and use 
that app to save a copy in tiff format.

It is a shame that there's still no tiff file tool in R (rtiff is old, 
bonged up, and ugly :-( ).  Matlab and GraphicConverter (and I believe 
GIMP) have no problem opening & converting tiffs.  We just need some 
energetic R-fan to code up a tool.

Thank you David and Simon,

This is very helpful. I was not aware of quartz.save() or the Grab utility.
Also I will have another look at the png format.

Both problems (help system and 32 bit cpu detection) appear to be fixed 
as of

R version 2.10.0 beta (2009-10-15 r50107)
R.app GUI 1.30-devel (5506 Leopard build 32-bit)

It's a function supplied by the R.app GUI. There is no help for it  
since it's not part of any package.

 > args(quartz.save)
function (file, type = "png", device = dev.cur(), dpi = 100, ...)

It's essentially a front-end to quartz() that is smart enough to find  
out settings from the current device so it can replicate the result  
using any quartz back-end. For parameters (except for "device" which  
is the device you want to save from) see ?quartz.

Cheers,
Simon

Ah, I see. It's not available when using R in Emacs, as I do:

Error in args(quartz.save) : object 'quartz.save' not found

Thanks for the clarification.

No, it's only available in the R.app. However, you could adapt it to  
your use -- the code is available at
https://svn.r-project.org/R-packages/trunk/Mac-GUI/GUI-tools.R

With

R version 2.10.0 beta (2009-10-15 r50107)
R.app GUI 1.30 (5506) x86_64-apple-darwin9.8.0

I can confirm that the help problem I reported (using ? and help())
are now fixed.

However, the GUI help interfaces -- text fields at the top of the
console and the top of the help window, do not seem to work.  The help
window gains (or keeps) focus but the help page is not updated.

Thank you for the quick update, I'll continue to poke around the help system.

help.search() now works in today's snapshot (and has caught up with 
2.10.0 beta), but did not in yesterday's.

Also, today's manages to install R.app and R64.app in Applications 
(the last two day's did not, even after I uninstalled those apps).

capabilities('tiff') reports no native TIFF support (someone who 
patently failed to RFTM called it 'misleading' recently despite the 
prominent NOTE on the help page): I thought you intended to add it?

Another thought for consideration: the Windows binary builds now have 
memory profiling turned on because although there is a small 
performance penalty, it seemed better to allow end users for do 
R-level memory debugging without needing to recompile R from the 
sources.  Might be worth it for Mac users too?

I did some Snow Leopard builds of 2.10.0 beta yesterday (on a machine 
that had been upgraded from Leopard, which may be relevant as we found 
some oddities, and will re-install it from scratch).

1) configure failed to find the X libraries (even though they were 
present), because it seems that /usr/X11/lib is no longer in the 
default ld search path.  We've seen something similar reported before, 
and e.g. LIBS=-L/usr/X11/lib fixed it.

2) I tried building (x86_64) with llvm-gcc and clang.  The build with 
llvm-gcc failed with an internal compiler error in datetime.c.  The 
build with clang almost worked, but had a configure error in package 
foreign.  The claims that clang was a faster compiler were obviously 
true, but the claims for better error messages seemed untrue: some 
were clearer but some were a lot more confused (not that production 
code is a good test of error messages).

Message-ID: <A945F313-BA2B-4174-A38F-AA55371B84D0@r-project.org>

Dear Mac users,

please consider testing R 2.10.0 beta *before* the release. First, we  
have now an automated installer generator system for Leopard and Snow  
Leopard (incl. 64-bit R), so it will be useful to test that it works  
as desired and second there was one very fundamental change in the GUI  
(not necessarily visible for the user but it makes sure any new  
debugging/browser support in R is passed into the GUI) so we want to  
make sure *before* the release that any issues are ironed out -- but  
we can only do that with your feedback.

The beta releases can be downloaded from
http://R.research.att.com/

Thanks,
Simon

Hi Simon,

You say on http://R.research.att.com/: "Please make sure you delete  
all old packages and re-install them after upgrading." What is the  
best way to automate that?

Michael

First, this applies only if you switch from Tiger build to Leopard  
build.

"The best way" depends really on your exact setup, but one way is  
something like this:

in your "old" R run:
a=.packages(TRUE); save(a,file="~/pkg.RData")

if you don't want to use your old R you can blow everything away, e.g.
RL=`echo 'cat(paste(.libPaths(),collapse="\n"))' | R --slave`
rm -rf $RL
rm -rf /Library/Frameworks/R.framework


Then install the new R and in the new R
load("~/pkg.RData")
install.packages(a[!a %in% .packages(TRUE)])

(If you don't blow away your old stuff and you have an unversioned  
custom library path, you have to use install.packages(a) to make sure  
old stuff gets overwritten)

Cheers,
Simon

I'm still having difficulty w/ some of the help features.
Specifically on a fresh start of the R GUI selecting "R Help" from the
Help menu opens up a blank help window and gives the following at the
console:

sh: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/share/sh/help-links.sh:
No such file or directory
Making packages.html . done

Also, the "magnifying glass" help files on both the R Console and the
R Help windows do not open the desired help pages, they only bring
focus to the help window.

Thanks for making R on the mac a pleasant experience.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] question about installing from source
Message-ID: <1256096662.4ade83965898f@webmail.purdue.edu>

I am trying to install the Rcartogram library.  I've never had trouble doing 
this before, but I recently upgraded to Snow Leopard, which may be causing a 
problem.  I do have FFTW3 installed on my machine, and I've never had trouble 
with it before either.  I even tried installing FFTW3 again, but this did not 
seem to fix the problem.

Here is the error I get when trying to install the Rcartogram library from 
Omegahat.  If anyone has any suggestions, I would really appreciate it.

You have compiled FFTW3 for 64-bit (the default on SL) yet you're  
trying to use it in 32-bit R. So either use 64-bit R (R --arch=x86_64)  
or compile FFTW3 for 32-bit (i.e., don't forget to add -arch i386 to  
CC and/or other compilers that may be needed).

Cheers,
Simon

yes, but you're using 64-bit R, however, Mark used 32-bit (look at his  
"arch" in the output and yours) -- that's the difference. Dynamic or  
static plays no role (in fact static has usually better performance)  
-- the only important part is --with-pic (on some archs).

FWIW a 4-way universal FFTW is now available from
http://r.research.att.com/libs/
so you don't have to compile your own (just make sure you delete  
previous dynamic builds if you had any!). It works with both 32-bit  
and 64-bit R on both Leopard and Snow Leopard.

Cheers,
Simon

The position of the plot window still ignores the preference setting, 
and resolutely appears bottom left.

A second point is the Undo. When I sequentially undo code in the GUI, 
right brackets that have been inserted automatically are ignored 
during the undo, so that they remain after all the other code has 
been undone. The same applies to double and single quotes.

I installed the earlier RC r50178 and attempted to install package rms  
with dependencies to the "System Level" using the GUI Package  
Installer from CRAN. 10 minutes later I am still looking at a spinning  
rainbow ball. The Stop icon on the Console window is greyed out and  
not responding. <esc> has no effect.

So, now that I have an R system that won't do an useful work for me,  
is there an exit set of keystrokes and  what is the proper way to  
gracefully retreat to 2.9.2?

I echo the thanks despite this glitch, since my overall experience is  
very positive with the Mac version and I could not get half as much  
useful work done on alternate systems.

Yes -- that's a function of the Quartz device -- ever since it has  
been moved from the GUI to core R it doesn't listen to what the GUI  
says anymore ;). It's too late for that now but I'll put it on my list  
for 2.10.1.

Interesting point - I'll need to figure out where this comes from

Dear Roger and Simon,
Thank you for the advice about the difference in the compile options for 
different architectures. I used the link Simon provided:
http://r.research.att.com/libs/
I successfully installed the pre-compiled FFTW from their website, and 
subsequently I was able to install the Rcartogram perfectly. This is great!!
Thank you both for your kind help. This was an incentive for me to 
finally join the Mac list for R users too (I'm already subscribed to 
some of the other R lists).
Mark

There is no change I'm aware of since 2.9.2 -- if R is not coming back  
to the GUI due to some internet issues the behavior is the same -- you  
can't abort it unless you kill it (stop/<Esc> only affects R commands,  
but installation is done externally so it doesn't react to it).

Hello,

I'm having trouble running the latest version of R (2.9.2) in Mac OS X 10.4.11.  Once installed, the program crashes on launch, with the crash log giving the following error:  

Library not loaded: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.9/Resources/lib/libR.dylib
  Referenced from: /Users/jordythomson/Desktop/All Things Academic/Courses and TA Files/R Workshop/R.app/Contents/MacOS/R
  Reason: image not found


The folder R is trying to access no longer exists.  I had an older version of R there but uninstalled it and deleted the folder some time ago.  My question is how do I get rid of any remnants of the older version of R in my system?  I've read a few posts on this and removed all the folders (R.app, R Framework, R Preferences, etc.) and also run a complete uninstall using Terminal commands but R continues to try and access an outdated home directory.
I've also read section 12.16 of the online FAQ dealing with crashes on startup but the proposed solutions there don't seem to apply (they deal with old/corrupt .Rdata and .Rhistory files, which I don't yet have because I've not been able to run an R session).


Apologies if any of my terminology is unclear (I'm what you might call a basic R user).  Any advice would be more than welcome.

Perhaps I'm misunderstanding you, but I'm not sure how this is possible?

Your new version of R (2.9.2) is installed in precisely that  
folder ... the R.app file in your ../All Things Academic/../.. is  
simply referencing the R "system" installed in /Library/Frameworks/ 
R.framework/....

So, in short, you need /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.9  
and its contents to be there to have a working R on your system.

Does that help?

Hi Steve,

Thanks for the quick reply.  The Framework folder and contents are all there at /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.9, including the library file (libR.dylib).  For some reason, however, R still won't load that library and crashes on launch.  

I'm not sure why that would be.  Do you have any other suggestions?

Thanks for your time,

Jordy

Are you really sure? Run this in Terminal:

file /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.9/Resources/lib/ 
libR.dylib

You should see something like

hagal:urbanek$ file /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.9/ 
Resources/lib/libR.dylib
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.9/Resources/lib/libR.dylib:  
Mach-O universal binary with 2 architectures
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.9/Resources/lib/libR.dylib  
(for architecture ppc):	Mach-O dynamically linked shared library ppc
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.9/Resources/lib/libR.dylib  
(for architecture i386):	Mach-O dynamically linked shared library i386

and just to make sure that all is well you can also try

hagal:urbanek$ file -L /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/R
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/R: Mach-O universal binary with 2  
architectures
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/R (for architecture ppc):	Mach-O  
dynamically linked shared library ppc
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/R (for architecture i386):	Mach-O  
dynamically linked shared library i386

Simon

Hmm ... so I'm not sure what just happened since it wasn't there  
before (did you reinstall just now or something?).

I see Simon just responded to you, so definitely do what he suggests,  
but it seems something is wonky.

To minimize the back and forths, you might consider trashing the R.app  
you have in your *Academic* folder and reinstalling the R version you  
like from the appropriate *.dmg/*.pkg (eg. the new 2.10 RC is up at r.research.att.com 
  if you're interested in that).

If I recall correctly, the installer should put a new R.app in your / 
Applications folder. You should be able to move that wherever you like  
if you really don't want it there and it should "just work".

Hi guys,

I've started from scratch with R 2.9.2 and now have R.app in my Applications folder.
The Framework folder is in the proper place and I can find the libR.dylib file using Finder.  However, when I run the command in Terminal that Simon suggested it returns this error, even though the path is correct and the file is there:

/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.9/Resources/lib/
file:       cannot open (/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.9/Resources/lib/
file)
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.9/Resources/lib/
libR.dylib: cannot open (/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.9/Resources/lib/
libR.dylib)
[Process completed]

Sorry this is a pain... any other suggestions?!

Cheers,

Jordy

Hmm ... so I'm not sure what just happened since it wasn't there  
before (did you reinstall just now or something?).

I see Simon just responded to you, so definitely do what he suggests,  
but it seems something is wonky.

To minimize the back and forths, you might consider trashing the R.app  
you have in your *Academic* folder and reinstalling the R version you  
like from the appropriate *.dmg/*.pkg (eg. the new 2.10 RC is up at r.research.att.com 
  if you're interested in that).

If I recall correctly, the installer should put a new R.app in your / 
Applications folder. You should be able to move that wherever you like  
if you really don't want it there and it should "just work".

Hi

I had a similar thing long ago, so long ago I cannot remember the fix

But are you sure your permissions are all correct?

I had earlier succeeded on a second attempt using

  install.packages(pkgs="rms",  dependencies = c("Depends", "Imports",  
"LinkingTo", "Suggests", "Enhances") ) ## i.e the kitchen sink approach

So with the goal of creating an error log, I just now trashed rms,  
Design, rpart and Hmisc and tried using the Gui installer using a  
faster connection (Ethernet this time vs. WiFi earlier) and got the  
appropriate prompt installation of the missing items with "install  
dependencies" checked.. So I am unable to reproduce the prior  
problems. I now suspect it was a combination of slow connection and  
impatience. Apologies.

Well, if I were you I'd run
sudo rm -rf /Library/Frameworks/R.framework
and re-install R (using the installer). But if you want to try to  
figure out what's happening try this -- what does ls -l say? Run
id
ls -l /Library/Frameworks
ls -l /Library/Frameworks/R.framework
ls -l /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions
ls -l /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.9/Resources/lib

Simon

There is a also a utility to fix permissions under Applications- 
 >Utility->Disk Utility that will go through the library frameworks  
and at the very least, let you know the permissions have changed and  
what they should be, and at the very best, fix these.

Is it possible you installed the R under one user name (and/or  
upgraded after the initial install), and now are working under another  
username?

Good luck,
Kent

Hi,

I followed the instructions at http://jgr.markushelbig.org/JGR_%26_Snow_Leopard.html

R runs:

R version 2.9.2 Patched (2009-09-24 r50178)
x86_64-apple-darwin9.8.0

locale:

attached base packages:

loaded via a namespace (and not attached):
[1] rattle_2.4.90

However, if I try to run JGR, the splash window appears, then the  
console appears, and then it crashes.

Is there any log file left in the working directory? JGR usually
leaves something after a crash.

Message-ID: <7e5df3fe0910220200h71e22530y17db97c8697f8145@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm new to R and I've spotted what I think it might be a small issue
when rendering on a Quartz device. All images are initially cut on
their lower side. Once you resize the Quartz window, the image is
correctly displayed, even if you resize it to the original size.

E.g. I do: > curve(dnorm, from = -10, to = 10), and the X axis of the
plot is below the lower boundary of the window.

This issue does not happen on a X11 device for instance.

I'm running the latest stable version (2.9.2) on Snow Leopard 10.6.1.
I think the issue happened as well on 10.5 but I'm not totally sure.

Thanks in advance.

Best regards,
A.R.

I downloaded and installed
R version 2.10.0 RC (2009-10-20 r50178)
I am not experiencing the problems described earlier on this list, so  
they seem to be fixed.
Help works, and updating packages from the GUI works.

I only wonder why  R64.app binary and R.app have a
creation and modification date of
04/21/2009 and 05/23/2009
At least that is what is displayed in Finder on my machine.

Hi there A.R.,

I'll confirm that this happens in R 2.8.x and 2.9.x versions on OS X 10.5, but
it surely must be a well known issue.  My students ask me about it all the time,
and I just encourage them to resize their windows when they notice the problem,
and that is a temporary fix.

Mark

Assuming I understand what the problem is that you two are explaining,  
I'm a bit puzzled. I can't recall this ever really happening to me and  
I practically use R 24/7 (since ~ R 2.8.x).

I don't use R.app, though. I run R via the terminal and set my options 
(device="quartz") in ~/.Rprofile ... not sure if that would make a  
difference or not (I suspect not(?)).

I've also been using R-devel (2.10) for some time too ...

Dear Steve,

I'm using R 2.9.2, but I've noticed this problem too, since I began using R last
year (i.e., maybe since R 2.7).  I am using the R.app when I see this issue.  I
just tell my students that it's a minor bug and we won't worry too much about it.

Mark

Thanks, I can confirm that these are fixed in the latest nightly.
However, I think I've uncovered one more issue w/ the help system.

In the Package Manager window selecting a package displays the help
index.  *I think*, in previous versions, clicking on a function name
would take you to it's help page.   In the nightly version, nothing
happens.

I hope I've described it clearly enough to reproduce.

Running the 32 bit R.app GUI.

I start out with my Home directory as working directory.
I do a Change Working Directory to:  /Users/berendhasselman/Documents/ 
Programming/R/NonLinearEq.Test/nleq.test/nslv

Then do an Open Document... (Cmd+O) or a Source File... (Shift+Cmd+O).
The open file dialog doesn't start in the current working directory  but
in /Users/berendhasselman/Documents/Programming/R/NonLinearEq.Test.

After navigating to the working directory and opening a file, and then  
doing another open file the open dialog hasn't remembered the previous  
directory. I have to navigate to the desired directory all over again.

I can't remember if this also happened with R2.9.2. Sorry about that.

Message-ID: <7e5df3fe0910231234o477069c6re4f4ff4720a57958@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I've been given a CSV file saved on an old Windows 2000 machine. I
think it's coded in Windows-1252 (roughly equivalent to ISO-8859-1 I
think).

When I try to open it with read.csv('foo.csv', encoding =
'iso-8859-1') I get a coding error.

However, if I do:

options(encoding = 'iso-8859-1')
data <- read.csv('foo.csv')

The file is opened smoothly. What am I doing wrong? Shouldn't the
first work if the second does?

Thanks in advance.

Best regards,
A. R.

It's consider good form to reproduce the entire error message.

I cannot quite understand why you are annoyed/upset/bothered because  
the file opened smoothly. My reading of the code in read.table, and  
scan suggests that neither accesses the encoding settings that are  
stored in options. These observations suggest to me that your beliefs  
regarding encoding of the file in question may be false or you are  
spelling ISO incorrrectly. I would have expected it to be  
capitalized.  Searching the archives suggests that you may want to try  
encoding = "CP1252" for Windows csv files.

Perhaps you meant to use fileEncoding="iso-8859-1" instead of  
encoding="iso-8859-1"?  Because that does the same as setting  
options(encoding="iso-8859-1") -- see ?read.table for details.

While you're at it, why not try fileEncoding="cp1252", which should  
read Windows-1252 correctly (even the non-Latin1 characters)?  You  
should make sure that your R is running in a Unicode locale, otherwise  
it might complain because the Windows-specific characters cannot be  
represented in its native character set.

Message-ID: <6B5D2D12-252C-4871-927C-1652D48AB8EB@pueo-owl.ch>

I'm running R 2.9.2 build 5464 on OS X 10.5.8.  Having encountered  
memory allocation problems, I ran the problematic code in R64, the 64- 
bit version of the same build.  When I attempt to load openNLP I  
receive the error message that the 32-bit version that I had been  
using does not run in R64.

I understand that there is a 64-bit version of openNLP, and that it  
installs in R64 without problems.  I am assuming, however, that  
packages installed by 32-bit R and those installed by 64-bit R land in  
the same place, because I can see the 32-bit packages in the package  
list of 64-bit R. So my question is, when I subsequently switch to R  
(32-bit), will 64-bit versions of packages run there?  I'm trying to  
avoid constantly having to manually switch between 32- and 64-bit  
versions of packages.

Thanks,
Richard

Thanks a lot. That was the mistake I was making. I was using the
encoding parameter instead of the fileEncoding one, so I was setting
the encoding for the output not for the input. Now it works fine both
with and only with iso-8859-1 or cp1252. That's quite understandable
since cp1252 is a (non-strict) superset of iso-8859-1.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Increase heap space of openNLP
Message-ID: <20091026105428.M38533@pueo-owl.ch>

I'm not sure whether this question belongs in this SIG or in the R-help mail list.

I'm running R 2.9.2 "Leopard" version on a MacBook Pro 17" early 2009 laptop
with OS X 10.5.8.  Due to memory problems I am running the 64-bit version of
R.app, R64.  When I sentDetect I get a an out-of-memory Java heap space
exception.  How can increase the heap space to avoid this error?

Thanks,
Richard

I'm assuming you're talking about the Leopard build -- in that case  
both 32-bit and 64-bit are part parts of the same R and package --  
they are not a 'different package'. Please read about sub- 
architectures in R documentation to understand the details if you  
desire, but you are not supposed to "switch" anything. The only  
problems you can cause is to forget to upgrade your packages when you  
installed the Leopard build.

Thanks for the prompt reply.  Yes, I understand that I have just one package
and that I can start in in two modes.  If I launch R.app, R runs in 32-bit
mode; if R64.app, in 64-bit mode.

In 64-bit mode, it can happen that a package that I have installed while
running in 32-bit mode needs a 64-bit version.  Such a package is openNLP. 
Since posing the question I have in fact installed the 64-bit version.  In
that situation I encountered a Java heap space exception, which I have
reported elsewhere.  So I exited 64-bit R, and ran R.app (32-bit R).  The same
operation that encountered the heap space problem in 64-bit R ran without a
problem in 32-bit R, I am assuming with the 64-bit version of openNLP.

So I guess I must repose my question:  Will this always be the case?  That is,
will a 64-bit version of a package always run OK in 32-bit R?

Thanks,
Richard

Many thanks for your reply.  I'm afraid I'm very new at all this.  I really
don't know where to set the Java parameter -Xmx.  In most applications that
are written in Java for the Mac, there is usually some way to set those
parameters in the .plist of the app.  I don't find any such section for R.app
or R64.app.  I have located the openNLP package in ~/Libraries/R/Library/2.9,
but I don't see anything there.  I obviously looked in R-help for "increase
heap space", etc., before posing the question.

Could you be a bit more specific about where to set this parameter? 
Everything I do in R I do through the R GUI.

Thanks,
Richard

I think you're confusing things here and your assumptions are wrong.  
First, openNPL dos *not* include any native code, so it's neither 32-  
nor 64-bit -- it contains only R scripts. Further your heap overrun  
issue has nothing to do with 32-/64-bit per se -- you just didn't  
raise the heap limit as I was pointing out in my response to your  
other e-mail. And finally, there is no choice of 32 vs 64-bit for  
packages -- you can only run 32-bit packages in 32-bit R and 64-bit  
packages in 64-bit R. Consequently you can only run 32-bit Java in 32- 
bit R and 64-bit Java in 64-bit R.

It will never run.

If the packages you use don't override default settings you can simply  
set (example for 2GB):

options(java.parameters="-Xmx2g")

If they do, you can make 100% sure that they won't be able to by  
running the following before loading any packages:

library(rJava)
.jinit(parameters="-Xmx2g")

The above examples sets the heap to 2GB of memory -- but make sure you  
have that much memory otherwise Java won't accept it.

On the command line (Terminal) type "java -X" to see the Java  
parameters you can set.

Cheers,
Simon

NB: I still have problems with CC and OBJC equal to clang (from Apple) 
or to clang (from the llvm svn), even without the -fopenmp flag.

Jan,

Can you elaborate on how you invoke these settings for a R-devel  
build? Do you pass these along in a Terminal session, assuming BASH  
shell, via a series of export commands? I'd like to build this myself  
using llvm and see how it turns out.

Certainly, speeding up compile times is a nice benefit. Have you  
tested any R commands to compare performance of this build versus  
gcc-4.2? I wonder if the gains are passed along to application  
performance as well.

Thanks,
John

Yes. Here is part of the bash profile

export CC=/Developer/usr/bin/llvm-gcc
export CXX=/Developer/usr/bin/llvm-g++
export OBJC=/Developer/usr/bin/llvm-gcc
export F77=/usr/local/bin/gfortran

export FFLAGS="-m64 -O4 -Wall -fopenmp -mtune=native"
export FCFLAGS="-m64 -O4 -Wall -fopenmp -mtune=native"
export LDFLAGS="-m64 -fopenmp"

I haven't done any timing comparisons (yet).

Message-ID: <2A39138E-D79E-4000-BDE5-11C502AE3980@stat.unipg.it>

Dear Simon,

first of all I would like to thank you for providing the Mac binary  
package for the latest version of R.
It works ok on my two years old MBP with OSX 10.5.8.
As mentioned in the web page the GUI installed are two, 32-bit GUI  
(R.app) and 64-bit GUI (R64.app).
I noticed that running a simple loop in the two GUI I got different  
values. For example, having defined the function

fun <- function(n)
{ for(i in 1:n)
      median(rnorm(100000))
}

I obtained the following typical timings:

[R.app GUI 1.30 (5511) i386-apple-darwin9.8.0]
 > system.time(fun(1000))
    user  system elapsed
  30.131   2.460  32.506

[R.app GUI 1.30 (5511) x86_64-apple-darwin9.8.0]
 > system.time(fun(1000))
    user  system elapsed
  24.927   2.151  26.957

The second is always smaller, although my MBP is not 64 bit. Can you  
comment on that? I'm just curious.

I also noticed that running R64.app the X11 environment is also  
started (the graphical device is the default, i.e. quartz). This does  
not happen with R.app.

Aside, there is a broken link in the web page http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/ 
, namely the link to the tools directory for R-2.10.0.pkg (there is a  
missing 's' in the URL).

Best,

Luca

Your MBP *is* 64-bit capable otherwise you couldn't run the 64-bit GUI  
at all (there are very few Apple machines that had the early ICD/ICS  
without 64-bit support - they are rather rare, all other machines  
starting with IC2D are 64-bit capable).

On Intel machines the 64-bit instruction set is different form the 32- 
bit instruction set since it didn't have to follow the legacy baggage  
from 16-bit times of x86. As a result code using the 64-bit  
instruction set can be more efficient than its 32-bit (ix86)  
counterpart. This is counterbalanced by the fact that all pointers  
have double the size in 64-bit and thus you have to use double the  
memory and associated speed penalty, so depending on the task (yours  
is trivial enough to not involve too many pointer operations) the net  
result is speed-up or slow-down.

At a first glance I see no difference between those and neither of  
them starts X11 on my machine ...

Thanks, that was reported and fixed already.

First I downloaded the Mac binary from CRAN, but when I double clicked
on install icon it told me ``Couldn't open "R-2.10.0.pkg". This package
type requires Mac OS X 10.5.''

I guess I don't have 10.5.

(None of the information that I can extract from my machine refers to
``MAC OS X 10.x''; it only refers to apple-darwin<whatever> --- and
there never appears to be any information as to the connection between
the different forms of referent.)

Anyhow, I then decided to try to roll my own.  (This has worked in the
past.)  I downloaded the tar file of R 2.10.0, did ./configure and make.
It went about its business for a while and then stopped with an error  
message.
The tail end of the screen output is:

I haven't a clue what to do about this.  And so I'm stuck.  I'd  
really like to be using
the latest version of R, but I seem to be thwarted at every turn.   
Can anyone help me out?

Click on the "Apple" icon on the left-top corner and then on "About  
this Mac". It will say something like "Mac OS X Version 10.5.8" (or  
whatever version you have). The pkg build is for 10.5 and higher only  
(as the description prominently says).

It seems as if you're trying to compile 64-bit version of R on Tiger  
which won't work. Without further details on the tools you installed,  
exact OS version and the like there is not much we can help with  
(please have a look at the R for Mac FAQ).

Simon

	I certainly didn't ***want*** to build a 64-bit version.  I
	just downloaded the tar file file and went thought the usual
	routine.

	Is there some ``flag'' that I should set to obtain a build of

It's there, visit http://cran.r-project.org/, select the MacOS X option in the "Download and
Install R" area, then look down near the bottom of that page to see

 Information, tools and most recent daily builds of the R GUI, R-patched and R-devel can be 
 found at http://R.research.att.com/. Please visit that page especially during beta stages to 
 help us test the Mac OS X binaries before final release! The page has links to other builds, 
 including a 'Leopart build' which includes 64-bit architectures.

Yes, thanks, I see it now.  But it wasn't clear to me that I needed  
to go there.
I just assumed (silly me!) that the top listed item would be the  
appropriate
one.  However I now see that it does clearly say it is for Mac OS X  
10.5 and
above.  (This was less than completely helpful to me until just now  
when a
couple of people explained to me how to determine what the number of
my MAC OS X actually is.  I should explain that I am ***not*** a Mac  
user
by nature.  I am forced by my work place to use a Mac --- the choice was
either that or Windoze.  No poss. of using Linux.  Psigh!)

Message-ID: <6D524A9A-5ACD-4B06-B2BB-DA6994D7A7CD@auckland.ac.nz>


QUESTION 1:
===========

Yesterday I sent out a cri de coeur in respect of not being
able to build R 2.10.0 from source on my Mac (OS X 10.4.11).

Simon Urbanek informed me that I could get a working R 2.10.0
from http://r.research.att.com/ which I duly did.  That went
O.K.

Then today, because of another problem that I encountered (see
below) I decided to go back to R 2.9.2.  I retrieved the
tar file from the ``Source code of older versions of R'' and
went through the ./configure and make routine.  Blow me down,
but didn't I get the same error that I got when trying to make
version 2.10.0:

Simon told me that the error that arose when I tried to make 2.10.0 was
due to trying to build a 64 bit version under a too-ancient version of
Mac OS X.  Is the 2.9.2 release configured to produce a 64 bit version?
I ***thought*** I had installed 2.9.2 from source, but maybe not ....

Is there any way I can tell it ***not*** to go for a 64-bit version?
(Surely there must be, since the r.research.att web site provides a
version which runs under Mac OS X 10.4.11.)

QUESTION 2:
===========

The reason that I decided to go back to R 2.9.2 was that I tried to
install the contributed package spatstat (version 1.17.0) from source
and got an error:

gcc -arch i386 -std=gnu99 -I/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/ 
include -I/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/include/i386  -I/ 
usr/local/include    -fPIC  -mtune=core2 -g -O2 -c Kborder.c -o  
Kborder.o
Kborder.c:1: error: bad value (core2) for -mtune= switch
make: *** [Kborder.o] Error 1
ERROR: compilation failed for package 'spatstat'

I thought this error must have resulted from the upgrade to 2.10.0.   
However
when I finally succeeded in backing off to 2.9.2 (by getting a binary  
from
the r.research.att site) I got exactly the same error under 2.9.2.

What is this error all about?  What can I do about it?  Is there any  
flag
I can set for configure (???) that will get rid that -mtune=core2 in
the call to gcc?  What is ``mtune'' all about?  What does ``core2''  
mean?

Sheesh! :-)

Thanks for any enlightenment.

	cheers,

Under my newly installed version of R, 2.10.0, help.start() refuses
to perform.  When I issue the command I get a ``Host is unreachable''
message from the browser (which is Firefox, version 3.5.3).

I have seen things about funnies with help under 2.10.0 but have
not properly comprehended them.  I am not sure if they apply to my
situation.  I did a bit of scrounging through recent postings to
R-help and could not find anything relevant. Can someone tell me
***in monosyllables*** ( :-) ) how to get help.start() to work?

I have attached, in pdf form, a screen shot of the message I get

Right - there is a way, but you might not want to go there.
Learning about and properly configuring a build environment
on the Mac requires much time, patience and reading.

Simon wrote the book you'll be reading, so just download and
install Simon's pre-compiled R binary.  You can start reading the
book while it installs.  (The tcl/tk materials will help
you figure out what's wrong with your tcl/tk setup or lack
thereof on your Mac.)

I don't yet know about the core2 value for the mtune switch, 
but I do know about the excellent package installer and
package manager that Simon has set up in the Mac R GUI.
Install the Mac OS X R GUI from the r.research.att site.
Start it up, select "Package Installer" from the
"Packages and Data" menu item, select the CRAN (binaries)
option in the upper left of the dialogue, type "spatstat"
in the search field slot and click "Get List".
I see spatstat repository version 1.17-0 show up.
Click on that line, click the check box "Install dependencies"
at the bottom of the dialogue, then click "Install Selected".

Whenever this works, it is the preferred route in my books, as
someone else who probably knows a lot more about it has done 
all the compile management stuff.  

Simon's package management works very well, and I appreciate
the time it saves me.

The problem appears to be with "WebMarshal Proxy".  I don't know if you 
have any control over this, or it comes from your IT department, but you 
need to tell it to let Firefox connect to R on your own machine (address 
127.0.0.1) if you want help.start() to work.  If that requires you to 
set a particular port number (or range) for R to use, see the 
?tools::startDynamicHelp page for details.

You may find that the GUI works better.  It doesn't use Firefox, it has 
its own built in browser, and it's conceivable that it will avoid going 
through the proxy.

	This did not/does not happen with R version 2.9.2.  Why has
	version 2.10.0 introduced a difficulty?

Yes, the GUI works in respect of providing html help.  But

	(a) I ***HATE*** using the GUI.

	(b) Funny things happen when I try loading spatstat from the GUI.

	If I click on Packages & Data --> Package Manager, I get an error:

> Error in package.manager(is.loaded, pkgs, pkgs.desc, pkgs.url) :
>   invalid arguments (length mismatch)

	There ***are*** packages BACCO and forecasting in my local
	library (~/Rlib).  But ne'er mind.

	So I try

	library(spatstat)

	from the command line (in the window opened by the GUI).  I get an  
error:

> Loading required package: mgcv
> Error in dyn.load(file, DLLpath = DLLpath, ...) :

	However if I abandon the (expletive deleted) GUI, start R from the  
command
	line and then load spatstat, all is well.  (Modulo some warnings  
about packages
	being built under earlier versions of R whence the help might not  
work correctly.
	Which it doesn't anyway.)

	So why should mgcv load when R is started from the command line, but  
not
	when it is started from the GUI?

	This is getting ridiculous.  Everything I try engenders another  
error and
	another fiasco.  Things have become too complex and intricate.  IMHO  
too
	much effort has been expended on implementing gee-whiz facilities  
for the
	super-clever or GUI facilities for the retarded at the expense of  
simple
	usability for the ordinary middle of the road user.

		cheers,

Previous versions use static web pages; in 2.10.0 the help is generated 
when you ask for it.  The advantages of this are that links work better 
(very few package authors knew how to get them to work before), man 
pages can be customized to the state of your system or generated 
automatically, etc.

If you can figure out how to build it yourself, there's a configure

P. S. Exactly the same sort of gripe often applies to commercial  
software, and it's
admittedly much more irritating when you actually have coughed up  
hard cash
(willy-nilly) for an ``improvement'' that turns out to be a degradation.

I think this has been mentioned by others, but you seem to be making
life difficult for yourself.  When you install R on a recent mac you
essentially get two versions, one for 32bit and one for 64bit.  These
are not compatible w/ each other (and no amount of effort would ever
make them so).  The installer (2.10.0 IIRC) installs in addition a GUI
for each R.app (32bit) and R64.app (64bit).  The default when
launching R in the terminal with Snow Leopard appears to be 64bit.
You can check this by opening the Activity Monitor application and
looking for the R process.  If you install or build packages using the
default terminal version of R you *MUST* use R64.app for the packages
to work properly.  If built 64bit they must be run 64bit.  Your error
message say you are trying to load a package in 32bit R (probably
R.app) that have been install/build w/ 64bit R (the terminal).  I
recommend that you stick w/ one computer architecture (in this case
terminal and R64.app might work well for you).

I would gently suggest that this is not the best attitude to display
when trying to get help from volunteers.  I understand that you are
frustrated, but keep in mind that Simon and the other core developers
have expended far far more time that you've lost due to your
frustrations so that we could all have R.  Furthermore, the changes
that are riling you at the moment are as much (if not more so) a
result of the changes that Apple has made w/ Snow Leopard.

	Sorry to be a bit thick, but I don't quite follow this.
	Are you saying that the only way for me to get R for my
	machine now is to use a pre-built binary; that I ***can't***
	build from source?  This would seem to be so since:

	* you are saying that if I build from source then I *have*
	to use 64 bit R

	* but I have been told that I ***cannot*** use 64 bit R with
	Tiger.

	I guess that I can live with having to use pre-built binaries.
	Now that I know where to *get* a 32 bit binary, that's fine.
	The only reason I tried to build from source was because the
	2.10.0 binary on CRAN was 64 bit and that won't work under
	``Tiger''.

	I could also try to get my employer to upgrade me to Snow
	Leopard, but my chances .....

	Anyway ... I now have the 32 bit binary build, which I downloaded
	from the r.research.att web site, installed.  So how or in what
	way am I mixing architectures?  (I also downloaded the 2.10.0
	32 bit GUI from the r.research.att web site.  So all should be
	in harmony, should it not?)

After looking at the help for tools::startDynamicHelp and groping
around considerably, I had a look at the Firefox Preferences.
Going to Advanced --> Network --> Configure how Firefox connects
to the the Internet (Settings), I found stuff about ``Proxies''.
(Dunno what they are, but the word ``proxy'' came up in the error
message from Firefox.)

The existing setting was ``Manual proxy configuration''.  I changed
to ``No proxy'' (hammer and hope; no idea what I'm doing) and
help.start() took effect without any error messages appearing
from Firefox.

But I still got help in the command window.  Then I set

	options(help_type="html")

and it all worked.

I shall put options(help_type="html") into my .Rprofile, and
then help.start() should work automatically.  Said he optimistically.

What trouble am I leaving myself open to by setting ``No proxy'', but?

	cheers,

Mea culpa, I missed that point, and should have read more carefully.
My apologies to the whole list for making noise.  You can ignore the
bit about 64bit R and look forward to using it in the future.

That's not what I was saying.  You can build the source and it will
build as 32bit, but there's no reason for you to build the source, why
would you want to?

Again I fully understand you frustration, everyone has difficult times
getting things to work at one time or another.   It's annoying when
your "tools" break.  However, no one is forcing you to upgrade to
2.10.0 are they?  Nor are the developers of R forcing you to use it.
Take your anger out the on the people forcing you to use software
released three days ago on an operating system released 4 years ago.

You may find that you can't connect to websites outside of your local 
network.  Proxies are used to control connections in and out of 
networks.  Without the proxy you might be blocked; with it, some sites 
will be blocked, and others will be redirected through some server that 
lets them out.  It's also possible there will be no trouble, because the 
same scheme is sometimes used without the external blocking, but then 
usually the user of the system can't turn it on and off.

You should be able to program the proxy to be selective, and let Firefox 
connect to R directly but still redirect external connections to other 
sites, but you'll need to take some action to do it.

In my Mac Firefox, the default for 'Manual proxy configuration' is to 
have no-proxy exceptions for 'localhost, 127.0.0.1', which is exactly 
what you need -- these are set on the same screen.  (And I tested it 
with a proxy for HTTP, and help.start worked.)  So selectivity is the 
default.

Rolf,

you could save yourself a lot of trouble if you just looked at CRAN --  
you'd notice that I have actually released an official 2.10.0 binary  
just for you ;).

As for your woes - I suspect you have outdated Xcode tools, but  
unfortunately you appear to not have read my e-mail so I can only  
speculate.

Cheers,
Simon

note the version 2.7 there - you have apparently old packages for a  
different version of R on your .libPaths() -- bad thing.

Packages built for earlier versions of R usually don't work, period.  
If you get lucky, they might under certain circumstances, but you  
should always assume that they don't.

Check your .libPaths() - I bet they are different and you have  
outdated packages in one of them. If you wonder why, check your  
preferences.

I suspect this is all rather due to the customization and chaos  
created by the user ;) - the GUI actually tries to prevent such things  
by using separate library directories for each R version by default,  
but if you override that with your settings (especially using one  
global library), you can mess up things - but that's true in R in  
general, not really related to GUIs.

As Brian said, apparently there is a setting in Firefox that allows  
you to keep the proxy for external connection and use direct access to  
localhost (R help).

The reason why I said your should get the CRAN release of 2.10 is  
exactly because that binary doesn't use the core2 optimization flags  
(you still have the issue of having old tools so it may break  
elsewhere -- so that may or may not ease your woes ...).

Ok, so say so and I'll tell you how to find out :) -- the easiest is  
to click on
/Developer/Applications/Xcode.app
and see which version it is. Or, even better, just read
http://r.research.att.com/tools/
(the FAQ says the same thing about the tools you need but ... :P)

But back to your problem -- in order to support the optimizations (- 
mtune=core2) you want to switch to gcc-4.2 -- you can do that by  
typing "sudo gcc_select 4.2" in a Terminal window.

The most current version of Xcode for 10.4 is Xcode 2.5. You can get  
it from
http://connect.apple.com/
Login or create a (free) ADC account if you don't have one, then click  
on Downloads and then Developer Tools (on the right-hand side under  
Download). Then you get a long list of all tools - search for Xcode  
2.5 - download and install.
Again, something along those lines in the FAQ :P

Cheers,
Simon

	Yeah, I didn't/don't understand that, since I don't understand

	OK.  I'll get the CRAN release.  I'd still like to fix up the

	Did that.  'Mazing what I can do, once I know how! :-)
	It says version 2.5.  So, from what you said later in your
	email,
- search for Xcode
2.5 - download and install.

would seem to be up to date.

	I gave that a go just now, and it said:

	So I need to update my gcc.  But the FAQ says, in respect of
	C/C++ compiler (section 2.1.1) that I should download Xcode
	from http://developer.apple.com/tools/xcode/.

	And if my current Xcode (version 2.5) is uptodate, that won't
	make a difference, will it?  I'm puzzled.

	Well, I'm going to have a try at downloading the latest Xcode
	from the Apple site and see if that helps.

	Thanks for all your assistance.  I may well be bugging you
	again soon, I'm afraid.

	I don't understand how the 2.7 gets in there.  My .libPaths()
	(from the GUI startup) says:

	And /Library/Frameworks/R.framework is the current install
	of 2.10.0.  I had a look in /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/ 
Current
	and it indeed seems to be the current version.

	So how the (expletive deleted) is version 2.7 getting dragged
	into the picture?

	As far as I can tell, the only customization that I've done
	is to use ~/Rlib as my ``local'' personal library of packages.
	I.e. I have the lines

	in my .Rprofile.  Is there anything wrong with that?

	You lose your bet!  From GUI startup I got .libPaths() as
	shown above.  From the command line startup I get

	Looks the same to me!

P. S.  Since I'm raving on, I shall rave about another issue that has  
puzzled me
immensely.  I cannot seem to get package installation to work  
(completely)
from within R.  If I do something like

If I (in another window) cd to /tmp/Rtmpxp23QK/downloaded_packages I  
find
a file plotrix_2.7-2.tgz, and if I then execute

	R CMD INSTALL plotrix_2.7-2.tgz

from the (shell) command line, it installs just fine.

Any insights into what's going wrong?

It's in /Users/rturner/Rlib and in fact you can see that in the error.  
So I don't think it's deleted, really ;).

Yes - at least when you don't tend to it properly. If you use a global  
library, you must make sure you delete it whenever you upgrade R,  
otherwise you'll end up with incompatible packages. (There are less  
radical approaches, but they require even more care on user's side to  
work). That's why we recommend versioned libraries.

Yes, you're right on that one -- but both use your custom Rlib which  
is what causes the issue. Now why lattice loads in one or the other is  
a good question and the answer may be in the difference when .Rprofile  
is executed in one and the other (that part differs between the GUI  
and the command line) so I suspect .libPaths() are in fact different  
when lattice is loaded (explicitly or implicitly).

"Rlib" is a relative path - try using the absolute path.

Are you saying that every time I upgrade R I should completely
remove my private library of packages (``Rlib'') and then recreate
Rlib and re-install everything that was in it?  I guess I can automate
this so that it's not too hard to do ....

But is this the ``usual'' procedure?  Does everybody but me do this? :-)

Also, I have recently checked on freshly downloaded packages from CRAN
and got warning messages about their having been built with older
versions of R.  So re-installing would seem not to completely solve
the problem of incompatibility.

What are ``versioned libraries''?  Where can I read up on this
concept? RSiteSearch("versioned libraries") turned up nothing useful.

	cheers,

		Rolf

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Korean in quartz() device.
Message-ID: <CB1EB85A-C249-4DCB-9252-B83DB534DE0F@gmail.com>

Dear R users,

I run R-2.9.2 on the Snow Leopard 10.6.1 OS system. The default  
language of the OS is english.

I want to plot a very simple graph with Korean letters on a quartz()  
device, but it fails. Korean Letters appear as being squares.

The same command works fine in Windows systems.

My question is how can I draw or typeset Korean letters in quartz()  
device on SL OS?


Best regards,
Donghyun Oh

We don't have a reproducible example, but this usually indicates that 
the font you are using does not contain the glyphs you are requesting.

> The same command works fine in Windows systems.

Unlikely, as quartz() does not exist on Windows, and on the windows() 
the font selection is crucial for CJK glyphs.  How about the X11() 
device?

> My question is how can I draw or typeset Korean letters in quartz()

Probably, select a suitable font.  If you can prepare a reproducible 
example (see the posting guide) we may be able to help further. 
Please use \uxxxx or put the example on a website, as mailers frequent 
mangle non-ASCII content or attachments.

Hi

You can write the following in "~/.Rprofile".

----8<----8<----8<----8<----8<----8<----8<----8<----8<----8<----8<----
setHook(packageEvent("grDevices", "onLoad"),
	function(...){
        if(capabilities("aqua"))
            grDevices::quartzFonts(
              sans =grDevices::quartzFont(rep("AppleGothic",4)),
              serif=grDevices::quartzFont(rep("AppleMyungjp",4)))
        grDevices::pdf.options(family="Korea1")
        grDevices::ps.options(family="Korea1")
        }
)
attach(NULL, name = "KoreaEnv")
assign("familyset_hook",
       function() {
            macfontdevs=c("quartz","quartz_off_screen")
            devname=strsplit(names(dev.cur()),":")[[1L]][1]
            if (capabilities("aqua") &&
                devname %in% macfontdevs)
                    par(family="sans")
       },
       pos="KoreaEnv")
setHook("plot.new", get("familyset_hook", pos="KoreaEnv"))
setHook("persp", get("familyset_hook", pos="KoreaEnv"))
----8<----8<----8<----8<----8<----8<----8<----8<----8<----8<----8<----

familyset_hook is a claptrap method.

There were no italics in Japanese, but there were two weight fonts.
I don't know good Korean font, choose a good font, please.

... not sure what to say about that, but it seems weird if that's  
really happening on freshly installed packages (ie. not picking up an  
older version of your libs somehow).

More info than you want/need to know (or may already know, but anyway):

The "Framework" way that R is installed under OS X is "an easy" way to  
keep these "versioned libraries." You see how R installs in:

/Library/Frameworks/R/Versions/2.X/...

There is no "global R library", by default, but rather a "global  
library" for a particular *version* of R:

/Library/Frameworks/R/Versions/2.X/Resources/library

Then you get the fancy linking from /Library/Frameworks/R/Resources ->  
Versions/2.X/Resources and what not so the running version of R thinks  
there is some global repo.

Answering what you really asked more directly: I suspect Simon's  
recommendation for "versioned libraries" would be for you to do  
something along the same lines the system uses.

For instance, if you want to install into ~/Rlib, perhaps you should  
rather have:

~/Rlib/2.9/
~/Rlib/2.10/
etc

with each having their own (appropriate) versions of the libraries  
that you use. Which is to say, to have "versioned libraries." :-)

If you decide to go that route, perhaps you can then have in your  
~/.Rprofile some mechanism to pick which of these directories to add  
to your libPaths by checking R's major/minor version. There's probably  
a more clever way, but this way could work:

r.version <- paste(version['major'], as.integer(version['minor']),  
sep=".")
Sys.setenv(R_LIBS=paste("/Users/rturner/Rlib/", r.version, sep="")

Hope that's helpful,

I run update.packages(checkBuilt = T) which seems to do the job.

In that case I don't think you can use the real power of i7 which lies  
in up to 8 parallel HTs (with i5 you get 4 regular cores w/o HT and  
C2D gives you 2). I'm not sure whether the memory will have a big  
impact. On Nehalems the impressive part is that it can feed the HTs  
fast enough (which was not the case with the previous archs) - but  
that doesn't matter for you since you won't use them. At least the  
Harpertowns were pretty good at feeding up to 6 cores so I didn't see  
a big difference. However, Harpertown was still the high-end line, so  
I'm not sure how it compares to C2D memory throughput. (I was  
impressed by the performance of C2D in my MBP when you omit the fact  
that it's just two cores).

If you can send me a working example of your code I can run it on C2D  
and Nehalem machines to give you an idea how they compare ...

The i5/i7 iMacs are not shipping here yet, either, so it will take a

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] filled.contours and quartz() problem
Message-ID: <20091030150538.GQ5131@marco.fz-rossendorf.de>

has someone tried `filled.contours' with a `quartz' device?

for me, contrary to using `X11' the display is corrupted by
visible rendering of all contour lines (looks as if `contour'
output is overlayed on the image with a thin line width in a
whitish color) as well as the pixel boundaries .

the same happens, when I first draw to `X11' and then
`dev.print' to a pdf-file: with `gv' under X everything looks fine,
using `PreView' under Aqua looks like the `quartz' ouput. 

I know that Apple's pdf rendering engine used to be buggy (don't know 
if this is still true) but I'm not sure that this is the reason.

it seems that somehow gaps of one screen-pixel are introduced between
the constant-color patches.

is this known? can something be done about this? 

regards,
joerg


ps: partly the problems occur with `image', too: here the quartz display
of looks ok, but viewing the same image after dev.print(pdf) shows the
image pixels separated by (I presume one) screen-pixel gaps. viewing
the pdf-output with `xpdf' on a linux machine showed similar behaviour.

I just did with the first example in the help page and the output is  
not as expected. The left axis tick.labels are plotted partially  
outside the display window, the labels on the color legend are mostly  
out of the plot window and the axis labels are completely outside the  
window. Resizing does not fix the problem, nor does saving and viewing  
in Preview.app.

I'm not seeing anything that looks visually unpleasant, but the edges  
appear to have a light highlight.

Plotting to x11() "works". But I do agree that the edges appear  
unhighlighted in comparison to the quartz output.

I am guessing this is new, since I am pretty sure that I have plotted  
that example before and not had the incorrect sizing.

So reinstalling the 2.10 version (R version 2.10.0 Patched (2009-10-29  
r50258)) has fixed the previous graphing anomalies I noticed with  
filled contour.

thanks, I had'nt noticed that (quick googling before pestering the
mailing list did'nt show this :-))

but this was not quite/exclusively my problem: 12.10 addresses only `image' behaviour and
states that this is taken care of in quartz. for image, I can confirm
that this is true.  but not for `filled.contours': here `quartz' excatly
shows what I have described previously. 

but by using quartz(antialias=F) the problem indeed goes away.

so, indeed your answer solved my problem (thanks again). two last
remarks: should FAQ 12.10 not be augmented in order to state that use of
`filled.contour' with quartz requires to use quartz(antialias=F)?
it would be even better, I believe, to add an updated FAQ 12.10 to the
manpage of quartz (and maybe `pdf'), which after all is a more obvious place to look for a
solution than the FAQ (which e.g. escaped my attention altogether...)

OK, you win. had I seen those two, I would have got it. not much sense
in arguing against a FAQ... but the thing runs at about 40 pages at the
moment and it really did not occur to me that this seeminlgy very
special problem would be in the FAQ at all. I still would prefer to see "FAQs"
which can be assigned to one or two manpages, there as well. at the very
least a comment concerning the antialias switch of `quartz' would do no
harm... but anyway, I'm happy again.

thanks again

Hi,

I made a couple of enhancements to the BBEdit Language Module found in  
this thread:
	https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-mac/2005-December/002520.html

I have uploaded the language module here:
	http://homepages.nyu.edu/~jmb736/code/R_language_module_for_BBEdit/R.plist

This language module, as revised, will detect R functions, so you can  
browse functions in the symbols menu.

I have not yet figured out how to match the function body.  As such,  
when the cursor is placed, not in the function name, but in the  
function body, the symbols menu will display "(no symbols selected)".   
I am not sure when I will next have time to look at this, but in any  
case, simply being able to browse function names is the really  
important thing (for me, anyway) so I do not have to scroll down a  
file or use the find dialog just to find a function.

I hope this is helpful.

Best,
Jonathan

I tried your R.plist in TextWrangler 3 and it failed to recognise  
functions.
I changed the function pattern to this

		<key>Function Pattern</key>
		<string>(?P&lt;function_name&gt;[a-z0-9_A-Z.]+)\s*&lt;-\s*function</ 
string>

and then TextWrangler does recognise R functions with function names  
appearing in the symbols popup menu.

The string for <key>Identifier and Keyword Characters</key> should  
also contain a 0 (zero digit).

Hi,

Thanks for noticing the missing 0.

I wonder why the function pattern works in BBEdit but not in  
TextWrangler, but since your revision seems to work in both, I swapped  
it in.

Could be a difference between BBEdit 8.5 and TextWrangler 3.0, which  
is related to BBEdit 9.2
BTW. I use TextMate for R. Brilliant.

OOC, have you made any mods to the R.tmbundle?

I'd like to get it to recognize s4 function defs. It's not a huge  
thing for me, so haven't spent the time to figure out the lang  
definitions, but was thinking if lazyness could prevail and see if  
anyone else has done so :-)

No, I haven't. Perfectly satisfied with the bundle out of the box.

Sorry can't help you.
You'll just have to start being not lazy:-)

Can you give an example? Maybe I can do easily.
[But it'd be better to write me privately. It's not a topic of that  
mailing list I think.]

I figured out how to write this so that BBEdit will recognize function  
bodies.  (I had not previously been familiar with PCRE.)

I updated the file at
	http://homepages.nyu.edu/~jmb736/code/R_language_module_for_BBEdit/R.plist
so that it will recognize functions of the form
	function.name <- function(...) { statements }
or
	function.name <- function(...) ( statements )
but not
	function.name <- function(...) statement;

Code folding will now work.  Further, BBEdit will always display the  
name of the function the cursor is in.

Best,
Jonathan
