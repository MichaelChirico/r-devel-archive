Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] RSPerl and leopard (osx  10.5.3/4)
Message-ID: <3ECF93D6-54BE-4169-9D8C-47BF2B196019@epfl.ch>

Hi all,

does anybody has any experience in installing RSPerl on leopard  
(10.5.3/4) ?

I am using R version 2.7.1 (2008-06-23) with the command:
sudo R CMD INSTALL -c --configure-args='--with-in-perl'  
RSPerl_0.92-2.tar.gz

First the compiler stopped after returning :
cc1: error: invalid option 'arch=nocona'

Then in the /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/etc/i386/ 
Makeconf file, I removed the "-march=nocona" entries (https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-mac/2008-January/004462.html 
) and now here is the returned message :

I would wonder about the need for 500000 MCMC samples.

Also I assume 17 discriminant parameters so 500000*17*8=68M or 136M  
with the difficulty, which seems much less than 1.2G.

Looking at the code ideal seems to do most of its work in C code so  
I'm assuming it's not wasting it. Hence the memory is not strictly  
needed at simulation time, so you should get away with 64-bit version  
of R (see http://r.research.att.com/ ) which will swap out the storage  
as you go (the final collection of the result matrix will be probably  
very slow since it will have to activate all that swapped memory, but  
given that it's a selective copy operation it should still be doable).  
It's kind of beyond me why you need 500m iterations, but that's  
another issue ;).

Cheers,
Simon

The way RSPerl attempts to build the code simply doesn't work in this  
setup. The main problem is mismatch between what R sees and what Perl  
sees. Simply pasting their compiler flags doesn't work, because R uses  
10.4u SDK whereas Perl uses 10.5 system libraries directly. The error  
you get is due to that fact - libutil is only present in 10.5 and not  
in 10.4, but RSPerl attempts to link it using the 10.4 setup. I  
suspect that for this to work RSPerl would need to be designed more  
carefully to use the separate compiler and flags for each part of the  
interface.

You can get past that error if you use R compiled specifically for  
10.5 (thus without the 10.4u SDK), but still RSPerl doesn't work for  
me in that setup because of this error:
 > library(RSPerl)
Error in dyn.load(file, DLLpath = DLLpath, ...) :
   unable to load shared library '/Users/urbanek/Library/R/2.8/library/ 
RSPerl/libs/i386/RSPerl.so':

   Referenced from: /Users/urbanek/Library/R/2.8/library/RSPerl/libs/ 
i386/RSPerl.so
   Expected in: dynamic lookup

I didn't dig deeper, but I suspect here are even more problems with  
RSPerl. You may want to contact the maintainer for help.

Cheers,
Simon

PS: I could only find RSPerl_0.92-1.tar.gz on the omegahat webpage, so  
I'm wondering where you got 0.92-2 ...

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Installation of packages via GUI
Message-ID: <C492BE25.67C1%dafshartous@med.miami.edu>



All,

I'm running R v2.7.1 on Mac OS X.  When I go to the R package installer GUI,
I am not prompted to select a repository.   The usual screen is there but
the columns for package, installed version, and repository version are all
populated via blank entries.

If I select "Get List" the error below occurs.  The same thing occurs if I
go form the command line via install.packages.  Any suggestions much
appreciated.

Cheers,
David

This indicates that you selected one before and told the GUI to  
remember it. You can change it in Preferences->Startup->Default CRAN  
Mirror.

Probably your mirror is broken. Try selecting a different one (see  
above).

What is it supposed to do? There is no "shell" function in R. Are you  
looking for "system" maybe?

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Problems with playwith package
Message-ID: <C495071A.67EB%dafshartous@med.miami.edu>


All,

I've installed the playwith package and the GTK libraries for MacOS as
instructed at playwith.googlecode.com.

However, invoking the playwith function seems to crash R.  Below is an
example for a simple clould plot.  Is there something else I need to do RE
setting up?

Cheers,
David

All,

How does one change the relevant settings such that a new plot doesn't
overwrite the current plot in the quartz window?

Cheers,

E.g.,

As Philippe said opening a new window with dev.new() [or quartz()]  
will do the trick. Just for completeness you can use Back  
(<Cmd><Left>) and Forward (<Cmd><Right>) in the Quartz window to  
switch between the last couple of plots in the same window.

Simon

Dear Mac-R-users

I installed the rgl package via the R-GUI installation menu as a  
binary (version 0.79).
I use the R- 2.7.1 and i run it on a intel Mac (Leopard 10.5.4).

The command rgl.open() gives me the following error:

error in rgl.open() : Cannot create font, error code: 1

Any suggestion to solve my problem?


Thanks

Yours Faithfully,

Christoph Hofer

There are problems with the font handling in 0.79 on MacOSX.  Your 
options are to rebuild from source without including the FTGL/Freetype 
handling, or go back to 0.77, or to figure out what's wrong with the 
configuration and fix it (and then tell me or Daniel what's needed!)

Another suggestion:

Don't use rgl.open, use open3d.  But before you do that, try

r3dDefaults$useFreeType <- FALSE

I don't know how to get FTGL/Freetype to run properly on MacOSX, but 
this avoids trying.

I believe the first line is needed in 10.4.  Is there a conditional to 
select just that version?

Thanks, that looks simple, and rgl still compiles in Tiger.  I'll commit 
the change as soon as I have an Internet connection again.

I'm still seeing problems with the display of glyphs: it appears that 
FTGL is not reading what FreeType sends properly, or FreeType is not 
reading the .ttf file properly.  For now I'm going to set 
useFreeType=FALSE on MacOSX.  It might help if FTGL could specify fonts 
by their characteristics, so I could use cairo or pango the way other 
devices do  -- but FTGL isn't currently being maintained.  Maybe it 
would be worth the effort to figure out what's going on in it and adding 
this myself.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Compiling package against shared library in other
	package
Message-ID: <487530A8.6070202@gmail.com>

Hello,

This is my first attempt at compiling and installing packages in R for
Mac OSX, so please bear with me.

I have sucesfully installed and compiled an universal binary for a
package with some C code. Now, another package needs to link against the
.so file when compiling its own C code. I have LinkingTo in the
DESCRIPTION and that seems to do the trick, except that R is looking it

/Library/Frameworks/R.Framework/Resources/Library/FLCore/FlCore.so

when in fact the file is in

/Library/Frameworks/R.Framework/Resources/Library/FLCore/i386/FLCore.so

with another copy in .../ppc/FLCore.so

I did not specify the architecture before calling R CMD INSTALL --build,
as there is no configure script.

Am I missing something obvious? Do I need to provide a Makevars file?

Thanks,


Iago Mosqueira

Message-ID: <47fce0650807100544id81eeednfebece450c3d49a8@mail.gmail.com>

Hello R-Mac experts,

When I build a shared object (R CMD SHLIB hellocalc.c) I get a warning
about duplicate libgcc_s.1.dylib. The generated 'hellocalc.so' can be
loaded and works well but I wonder if I am supposed to do something
(what?) to prevent this warning. There are (few) related questions in
the maillist archive, but in those cases there were errors and not
just warnings.

I also ask because if I do 'R CMD CHECK helloC' the generated
'helloC.so' doesn't work (~cannot load shared library 'helloC.so'
[...]  no suitable image found.  Did find: [...] helloC.so: mach-o,
but wrong architecture) and I am not sure if this has to do something
with the above mentioned warning.

It doesn't. You cannot use R CMD SHLIB manually to build a package,  
because that compiles only one architecture. First make sure that you  
don't have any binaries in your package. If the problem still  
persists, please send me the full output of R CMD INSTALL.

Cheers,
Simon

Thanks for your answer. What happened was, that 'R CMD CHECK helloC'
generated 3 shared object files at the following locations:
1) helloC/src/helloC.so
2) helloC.Rcheck/helloC/libs/i386/helloC.so
3) helloC.Rcheck/helloC/libs/ppc/helloC.so

It was a little unexpected that the shared object at 1) is for _ppc_
architecture even when I use an intel based MacBookPro.

Before checking the package I compiled/debuged the helloC/src/*.c code
with XCode and used 'R CMD SHLIB' to generate a helloC.so (which in
this case was for i386 and could be loaded by R).


> [...] If the problem still persists, please send me the

Works fine now. Except for the warning message which is still the
same. But I can live with this.

Best,
Hans-Peter

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] How to set par() defaults
Message-ID: <48767788.1060409@witthoft.com>

I'd like to set a couple default values, such as 'cex,' so that they 
apply to every graphics window I open.  How to do so?
The problem is that any call (from R.app menu or a quartz() call) makes 
par() generate the window from some internal default list, so invoking 
par(cex=.5 ,{etc.}) from the command line gets overruled.

Thanks

Message-ID: <594D39E315F6FC4FA7EC15372770AAC16615A7@upcimail>

I've tried indenting a block of text in the R.app editor using a
standard
convention - highlight, then press "tab".
It doesn't work of course.
Trying alt-Tab to see if un-indenting works,
I found that alt-Tab inserts a tab, a hyphen-like character (but not a
hyphen;
unix od reports three bytes, 342 201 203),
and another tab.  

On rare occasions, I find that in a session pasting anything at all
causes a set of lines to indent with the strange character imbedded.
Restarting R removes the behavior.

Cute stuff like filtering through a unix pipeline to add a tab
and pasting into the editor leads to the same strange character.

Not a complaint (though indenting and ex-denting a block would be
convenient),
just curious!

Version: 2.7.1 RC (2008-06-15 r45927)

Hi

Can't find this error in the archives, hoping someone has solved this  
already.

I'm trying to run ODBC queries to a filemaker database running on FM  
Server. I have the Actual drivers installed, and the query is working  
in Excel and able to import data.

When I specify the query in R I get the following....

 > channel <- odbcConnect(dsn='Flapjack', uid = "Admin", pwd = "!^% 
$#jjs")

There were 50 or more warnings (use warnings() to see the first 50)
 > warnings()
1: In odbcDriverConnect(st, ...) :

I get something there about the wrong architecture on warning 1, and  
the rest of the warnings are all the same.

Does anyone know how to fix this?

A couple workarounds:

Use ShowRuler and Copy/Paste Ruler.  This does something different, i.e. 
it moves the margin for the selected lines, rather than inserting a tab, 
but the visual effect is the same.

Or you could edit in TextWrangler,  which has a "MoveRight" and 
"MoveLeft" menu command -- and there is a context-coloring plug-in for R.

All
Got the solution figured out. Documenting here just in the case anyone  
else encounters this. The Acutal Tech drivers recomennded by filemaker  
on their website today include ivslk18.dylib as the client driver for  
fmpro. The FMserver manual mentioned that it should be using  
ivslk20.dylib. So I found a copy of the correct driver here http://fmdl.filemaker.com/drivers/9/xdbc_odbc_mac.dmg 
  updated the client driver and R is talking now.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Weird problems in Leopard
Message-ID: <487E6025.8050708@stats.uwo.ca>

I've just bought a new iMac with 10.5.4 of OS X.  I installed R 2.7.1 on 
it with no problems.

I tried to install Xcode 3.0, but three downloads (two Firefox, one 
Safari) were corrupt, so I installed 3.1.

Now, the weirdness:

When I try to install rgl from the CRAN source,  or from a local 
directory using R CMD INSTALL, the configure script fails with these 
messages:

checking for X... libraries /usr/X11/lib, headers /usr/X11/include
checking for glEnd in -lGL... no
configure: error: missing required library GL
ERROR: configuration failed for package 'rgl'
** Removing '/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/library/rgl'
** Restoring previous 
'/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/library/rgl'


However, if I run the configure script (as ./configure) within the local 
directory, it succeeds:

checking for X... libraries /usr/X11/lib, headers /usr/X11/include
checking for glEnd in -lGL... yes

I can then move the configure script out of the way and R CMD INSTALL 
proceeds (until it gets to the FTVectoriser error, which I'm working on 
fixing).


Why would R CMD INSTALL make the configure script fail???

Did you compile R on the same computer ?

I have Xcode 3.1 plus the gfortran from Simon's site, so I think so.  In 
any case, things go pretty far if I don't run within R CMD INSTALL.

No, I just installed the binary from CRAN.  That's likely the problem.

Yes, that R comes with its own config parameters, and
much has changed in X11/GL since Leopard first appeared.

Message-ID: <52863.1216243973@cpc6-cmbg2-0-0-cust944.cmbg.cable.ntl.com>

I came across the following bug in R 2.7.1 (installed from .dmg on
CRAN); I note that the help page for png does say the quartz support is
experimental, but just wanted to check whether this issue was known:

When drawing multi page plots, the 2nd page seems to remember some of
the first page, and so on...


png(file="hists_%03d.png")

for (i in 1:3) {
  par(mfrow=c(2,2))
  hist(rnorm(100*i), main='')
  hist(rnorm(100*i), main=paste('value of i is', i))
  hist(rnorm(100*i), main='')
  hist(rnorm(100*i), main='')
}

dev.off()


The fix I found to get the right plots was to change the png type:

png(file="hists_%03d.png", type='Xlib')

Message-ID: <E8D631C1-980D-4519-A9D7-209DC70A6D67@exeter.ac.uk>

Dear all,


I've just installed R on a new MacBook Pro, and I'm facing the  
following issue: continuous lines in some graphs appear with a  
discontinuity when I use the quartz or png() device. I really don't  
think it comes from this specific code as the pdf() output is fine,  
and so is the output on other machines. I have no clue where the  
problem is, I can't nail down what triggers it (I haven't been able  
yet to create a minimal example, sadly). The screenshot attached shows  
the result of the pdf() device vs the default quartz() device, note  
the broken lines in the middle of the right side graph.

Has anybody faced a similar glitch before?

Many thanks,

baptiste

Yes, I have just started to notice this in the past two weeks and I have no
explanation.

Hard to tell unless you look at config.log... Anyway, unless you work  
around the bug in Leopard's X11 in your configure you have fix to X11,  
GL is broken:

http://r.research.att.com/building.html

Also if you want to use X11 on Leopard seriously, it is recommended to  
use this update:

Me culpa - it's a bug in Quartz code that uses bitmap rendering (i.e.  
on-screen and bitmap formats) which splits lines to segments for  
faster rendering and produces a gap between such segments. It should  
be fixed in tonight's nightlies.

Thanks,

Thanks, I'm glad this has a logical and easy explanation!

I assume the nightly build you refer to is located here: http://r.research.att.com/ 
, would it suffice to upgrade the R.app or is the quartz thing part of  
the heavy R dmg file? Two days ago I tried to install R from source  
and it failed for some (obscure to me) reason, so I hope it's not  
required to fix this.

Many thanks,

baptiste

You'll need the whole dmg file, but wait until tomorrow, because  
today's changes are only reflected in tonight's build.

Not really. You don't really need to do it (make sure your have Xcode  
installed), but if it is not anything covered by the FAQ, send me the  
output and I can have a look.

Jan send out the email below quite a while ago. Now 10.5.4 has been  
released as well as Xcode 3.1 and I don't see any sign of gfortran (at  
least when I read the release notes, I have not installed Xcode 3.1  
yet). I am not following the apple developer email lists, but could  
someone please give a two line summary on whether gfortran support has  
been dropped entirely or whether it has been postponed a lot or just  
for a short while?

Thanks
Kasper

AFAIK there is no official gfortran support. I have patches to Apple's  
gcc that allow to build gfortran from Apple's sources (see http://r.research.att.com/tools/ 
  ). Essentially it requires gcc 4.2 which is now part of Xcode 3.1  
(gcc 4.0 was hopeless in that respect). I'll release another binary  
once the Xcode 3.1 sources are available.

Simon

Dear all,
I use BioConductor affy package on a Mac OS X 10.4 machine, ReadAffy crashes R. The same problem has been reported earlier by another user (see http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.science.biology.informatics.conductor/16747), but no solution has been suggested yet. 
Here I show you the error message and session information for R 2.7.1, but the same problem has been observed under R 2.6.0 (both 32 bit and 64 bit versions). 
Please let me know if you have any ideas/comments/suggestions. Thanks a lot!
Weijun

Weijun,

you may want to report this to the authors of affy as this is possibly  
a bug in affy (BTW: are you sure you compiled it from source? I don't  
think BioC supports OS X 10.4 binaries). Unfortunately your example is  
not reproducible (we would need the input files).

Cheers,
Simon

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] strange behaviour when quitting
Message-ID: <4884FAE5.402@witthoft.com>

I have delved into the darkness :-),
and something odd is happening.  I saw this w/ a couple versions of R 
2.7.x :

First, I created an environment variable inside my .Rprofile (quoted 
below).  The variable itself works just fine.  Here's the strange thing: 
when I invoke q() or hit <CMD>-q to quit R.app ,  R throws up a new 
Untitled window that looks like it might be a new quartz window, then 
goes ahead and quits.


myRprofile: (ignoring lines which work and do NOT affect the quit() 
behavior.  I tested extensively and only this binding makes a difference)

makeActiveBinding("newq", function(...) { quartz() ; par(cex=0.75)}, 
.GlobalEnv)->nullity
rm(nullity)


A couple notes: I redirect to the variable 'nullity' so that R.app won't 
throw anything onto the console window.   I put the ellipsis in because 
otherwise I get a Warning about unused or missing arguments to function().

I also tried putting the line

rm(newq)

into .Last, but that didn't help either.


thanks for advice.
Carl

Why do people call things they do not understand 'strange', and use 
subject lines that fail to mention key facts (the use of active 
bindings)?

Are you saving the workspace?  That will access the active binding (twice, 
I think).  With

.Last <- function() rm(newq, envir=.GlobalEnv)

it should work.  I tried

invisible(makeActiveBinding("newq", function(...) cat("OK\n"), .GlobalEnv))
.Last <- function() rm(newq, envir=.GlobalEnv)

successfully.

I'd just wrap the call in invisible().

Message-ID: <5DC5CD7B-2376-4873-B41B-1B09DA21F1DE@stat.purdue.edu>

I am using an external editor (TextMate) with R and I want to be able  
to successfully use trace(function, edit=TRUE).  Has anyone been able  
to do this?

I am using Leopard, R version 2.7.0 R.app GUI 1.24 (5102).  I've tried  
it with other external editors as well.  For example, set an external  
editor (TextEdit, for example) in the Preferences and then try  
"trace(plot, edit=TRUE)" and add something like "message('hi')" to the  
top of the function, save and exit the text editor.  Then call  
"body(plot" in R - the added line is not there.  Is it not possible?   
Thanks!

This does seem a lot of work to do something that could be done better 
by

     setHook(packageEvent("grDevices", "onLoad"),
              function(...) grDevices::quartz.options(pointsize=9))

Changing cex will not do the same thing, and 'pointsize' is the preferred 
way to scale all the text (and line spacings etc) for a plot device.

You could also have

newq <- function() { quartz() ; par(cex=0.75)}
options(device=newq)

or similar.

Ryan,

It takes a few more steps in an external editor:

1.	In your example below, with TextMate as the external editor  
preference, change the 1st line in the newly opened Textmate edit  
window from 'function (x, y, ...)', e.g. to e.g. 'myplot <-function  
(x, y, ...)'

2.	Add, again following your example, the 'message("Hi")' line

3.	Send the document to R (you can't use Command-R immediately as the  
Textmate edit window is likely in default mode (unless you saved the  
file with a .R extension). Change it to R mode and Command-R should do  
the trick. Or select the appropriate entry from the R command group.

Using the external editor, R is not kept 'waiting' for the editor to  
close, so above steps are required.

For this reason, I rarely define TextEdit etc. as an external editor  
in R.app's preferences. All edit work I do inside a TextMate project  
and 'source' (command-R) files from there. Your example then happily  
uses the internal editor. By saving the edited trace file from within  
the internal editor in your TextMate project directory, it will be  
added to your project list in TextMate. This way I can also use the  
other nifty features of the internal editor (almost as a different  
kind of help window).

Hope this helps,
Rob

Hi Duncan,

Just to mention that the temporary fix that you proposed
for rgl version 0.8-0, indicated at the very bottom of this
mail, works as well on an Intel Mac, until you have fixed it
in the next version.  Thanks.

I'm forwarding this now to the R-sig-mac list, in case anyone
encounters the same problem.

best,

Ken

Hi,

Could anyone here provide some more details on the issue described
below? (That is briefly, when installing ggplot2 under R --
install.packages("ggplot2", dep=T) -- one finds a couple of
dependencies missing. Apparently this is a Mac-only issue?) What would
be involved in fixing it? I'd be willing to look into it if someone
would point out where to start. Thanks!

Hi David,

It's a bizarre bug with the mac version of R - I've complained about
it before but it hasn't been fixed yet.  Would you mind emailing
R-SIG-mac to complain?

Dependencies spanning more than one line were not included in PACKAGES  
generated by the Mac binary building script (quite obvious when you  
look at which dependencies of ggplot2 were not installed ;)).

Mainly reporting it :). It's the first time I hear about this issue.  
It should be fixed now - it may take some time until all CRAN mirrors  
have picked it up, though.

Thanks,
Simon

Complaining is exactly the wrong thing to do - if reported (as David  
did) it is usually fixed right away...

I've incorporated changes from Simon to the configure script, and the 
font finding changes Ken mentioned into a new version of rgl.  Before I 
send it to CRAN, could I ask one or two people who've had trouble with 
it in the past to give this version a try?  It's available at

Thanks.

I thought this was something we'd handled already.

Can someone remind me why some people prefer Apple to Microsoft?  I hate 
them both, more or less equally at this point.

Well it was described on R-devel with CC to you on 20 August 2007, but
I never got a response.

I don't think that's true - a) you never CCd me (I didn't get any such  
e-mail and there is no CC in the R-devel mail) and b) you got response  
from Brian and Duncan. You failed to follow up when Duncan suggested  
that it is likely a Mac issue (hence appropriate for SIG-Mac).

Simon

You have some local files that are masking Apple's X11 and causing  
problems (apparently freetype in /usr/local for example doesn't have  
the right architecture). I'd strongly recommend proceeding without 3rd  
party libraries or make sure they are complete.

Simon

Just a followup, that it compiled to the end and seems to work fine
on my powerpc running Tiger (don't fret Duncan), so the problem
is indeed just with my Leopard machine that seems to have acquired
some bad libraries or something that I'll have to  figure out to
correct.  So, thank you, Duncan.

The only oddity in the compilation (and this doesn't seem to
have prevented it from compiling to completion nor from
loading and running in R (at least the demos, as the error is
displayed as ignored) are the following lines:

mv x11*.o osx*.o Temp
mkdir -p AGL
mv AGL/* .
mv: rename AGL/* to ./*: No such file or directory
make: [aglrgl.so] Error 1 (ignored)

I guess that I shouldn't worry, but I would like to fix the
machine with Leopard eventually.

best,

ken

Hello,

Is there a way to change (longer) the tab-length in the editor in Mac-R?

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Moving to beginning of line
Message-ID: <C4B604EB.1AC6F%ken.williams@thomsonreuters.com>

Hi,

Regarding the following change in R.app version 1.25 (5166):

Last-update: 2008-06-16 [SU]
*    fix moveToBeginningOfLineAndModifySelection: (<Cmd><Shift><Left>)
    to behave as expected; implement deleteToBeginningOfLine:
    Note that *BeginningOfLine*: is still implemented the same as
    *BeginningOfParagraph*: which may lead to some confusion when
    working with multi-line commands (but this was always the case).

I can't seem to get my cursor to move to the beginning of the line anymore.
When I do <Cmd><Left>, the cursor just sits there at the right (or in the
middle) of the line, it doesn't move.

In version 1.24 <Cmd><Left> was already broken and did nothing, but I could
work around it by doing <Cmd><Shift><Left> and then <Left>.  Unfortunately
this doesn't work anymore.  Now the first action does correctly highlight
the part of the line to the left of the cursor, but <Left> does nothing.
<Right> puts my cursor back where it was before <Cmd><Shift><Left>.

Looks like a workaround is the Emacs keystroke <Cmd>-a.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] How to generate 24-bit PNG on Mac OSX
Message-ID: <e936a3d0807301921r9476447w298d0cfc989808c8@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there,

When I am using the png() function as the following to generate a PNG
file on Mac OSX Tiger, I found that the bit depth is 32.  But I need
24 bit depth PNG. What should I do?

> png(filename="/Users/usg/Desktop/new.png")
> plot(1:20)
> dev.off()


To avoid using "cairo", and R-2.7.0 does not find a Xlib on my Mac, I
also tried this one:
> png(filename="/Users/usg/Desktop/new.png", type ="quartz" )
> plot(1:20)
> dev.off()

It does not work, either.

The manual says "png will use a palette if there are less than 256
colours on the page, and record a 24-bit RGB file otherwise (or a
32-bit RGBA file if type = "cairo" and non-opaque colours are used)."

I don't have to set the palette less than 256 colours, I just want a
true color png file.

Any help is appreciated.

Thanks in advance.
Long

32-bit _is_ 'true color'. I think you need to turn anti-aliasing off if 
you want only opaque colours.

In general though, if you make unreasonable requirements you need to be 
prepared to do some work yourself -- there are many options to postprocess 
32-bit PNG or palette PNG or PDF to other formats.

Given that miktex is for windows, no it doesn't play nicely on os x!
Try the mactex distribution -  http://www.tug.org/mactex/.  There's
nothing else you need.

Thanks,
another thing that I am running into is I have created a data folder
in my working package.  it is SavannahRiver.rda .  I used the save
comand
save(x, file="SavannahRiver.rda")
and I can load the data fine, but R CMD check says

* checking package subdirectories ... WARNING
Subdirectory 'data' contains no data sets.

Hello,

I am not sure this resolves the issue you have identified, but I find  
that <Ctl><Left> moves the cursor to the beginning of the line using  
R.app 2.7.1 GUI 1.25 (5166).  I find this works on other text  
editors, too, such as SubEthaEdit and TextEdit.  However, the more  
familiar <Cmd><Left> also moves the cursor to the beginning of the  
line in those editors.

Cheers,
Ben

Not reproducible, but warning/error messages are usually accurate.

There are MiKTeX tools for Unix, including Mac OS X.

All you needed was the FAQ:

http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/RMacOSX-FAQ.html#TeX-suite-of-tools-for-documentation-_0028optional_0029

Simon and Stefano must find it frustrating to document all this and see it 
asked here so often.

The problem is that no-one asking a question knows the frequency at

Or that one has no idea how many people are not asking
 questions because they did read the FAQ.

help systems, I have found, to be comperhensive, but with a learning
curve as steep as the programing itself.  I am a biologist which may
explain everything.  Anyhoo,  thanks for all of the help in the past,
and in to the future

Let's not spend our time and resources thinking about things that are
so little or so large that all they really do for us is puff us up and
make us feel like gods. We are mammals, and have not exhausted the
annoying little problems of being mammals.
