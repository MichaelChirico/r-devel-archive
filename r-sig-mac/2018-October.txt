Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] enhance completion function to add () as well as $ on
 tab
Message-ID: <02450DCE-A58F-4016-AF5D-72EA4E544EFC@gmail.com>

Simon very kindly wrote this function a couple of years ago when I noted how nice it would be if pressing tab on an already-completed unique name would write a $ sign and give a drop-down of $ elements.

I'd like to improve the function so that if the completion is a function name, then pressing tab adds "()" (preferably leaving the cursor in the brackets)

  
umx_complete_dollar <- function ()  {
    RGUI = as.environment("tools:RGUI")
    RGUI$rcompgen.completion <- function(x) {
        comp <- function(x) {
            utils:::.assignLinebuffer(x)
            utils:::.assignEnd(nchar(x))
            utils:::.guessTokenFromLine()
            utils:::.completeToken()
            utils:::.CompletionEnv[["comps"]]
        }
        res <- unique(comp(x))
        if (nzchar(x) && identical(res, x) && !identical(substr(x, 
            nchar(x), nchar(x) + 1L), "$")) {
            rc <- comp(paste0(x, "$"))
            if (!identical(substr(rc, nchar(rc), nchar(rc) + 
                1L), "$")) 
                res <- rc
        }
        res
    }
}


Also, I added the function to my  ~/.Rprofile, but this function can't execute then  ( as.environment("tools:RGUI") fails with  "tools:RGUI is not in the search list"

Any clues to improving these? The functionality is worth its weight in gold, IMHO.

Tim,

if you want to experiemnt with this, the source for that function is in

/Applications/R.app/Contents/Resources/GUI-tools.R 

and I will certainly entertain patches.

As for .Rprofile, it is run before the GUI adds its tools to the search path so you can't modify it there.

Cheers,
Simon

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] pasting from the clipboard
Message-ID: <4fc6b0dd-1b65-4f9e-3908-ea4ecf7f6f29@atsu.edu>

My memory is that? on the Mac

dat = read.table(file = pipe("pbpaste"), header = TRUE)????? # should 
allow me to paste a dataframe copied from a spreadsheet into R.

When I try that in RStudio 1.1.456 with R 3.5.1 on OSX 10.13.1

I get the message:

 ? incomplete line found by readTableHeader on 'pbpaste'

Could anyone explain this message to me,? and more importantly, tell me 
the proper way to paste a dataframe copied to the clipboard from Excel 
on the Mac?

Hi,

The default cell (field) delimiter with Excel is the TAB character, so you want to use something like:

  read.table(pipe("pbpaste"), sep = "\t", header = TRUE)

Note that you will likely get a warning along the lines of what you got above, which I believe is due to Excel not having an EOL for the final row in the clipboard.

Regards,

Marc Schwartz

Another approach that should work cross-platform is to paste the data into
a string, then read the string using read.table():

my_str <- "<paste data here>"
my_df <- read.table(textConnection(object = my_str),
                            header = TRUE,
                            sep = "",
                            stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

The pasted data should have line breaks so each row is on its own line in
your script, and you'll want to adjust the parameters header and sep to
suit your data.

An example of suitable data would be:

my_str <- "T_/K Density_g/mL D2O
273 0.999841 1.10469
274 0.999900 NA
275 0.999941 NA"

Tom

read.table(text=my_str,....) saves you the dangling open connection.

For what it?s worth, this is the function I use:

umx::umx_write_to_clipboard <- function (x) {
    if (umx_check_OS("OSX")) {
        clipboard <- pipe("pbcopy", "w")
        write.table(x, file = clipboard, sep = "\t", row.names = FALSE, 
            col.names = FALSE, quote = FALSE)
        close(clipboard)
    }
    else if (umx_check_OS("Windows")) {
        write.table(x, file = "clipboard", sep = "\t", col.names = NA)
    }
    else {
        message("clipboard not implemented for *nix - awaiting a reliable solution. See:\n\t\thttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/13438556/how-do-i-copy-and-paste-data-into-r-from-the-clipboard#13438558")
    }
}


Checking for updates on the unix front, I see a package called datapasta https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=datapasta <https://cran.r-project.org/package=datapasta>

Not sure how good it is

Message-ID: <CABtg=KmNj9PGtm40D=UrpvP5Ubo6mB-9txB5AiuSuMjuejrgDw@mail.gmail.com>

https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools/ suggests installing a
special clang6 build. OTOH, the R binary links to a library that comes
with CRAN's clang4 build:

? otool -L  /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/bin/exec/R
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/bin/exec/R:
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.5/Resources/lib/libR.dylib

/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.5/Resources/lib/libRblas.dylib
(compatibility version 0.0.0, current version 0.0.0)
/usr/local/clang4/lib/libomp.dylib (compatibility version 5.0.0,
current version 5.0.0)
/usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current
version 1226.10.1)

Notice '/usr/local/clang4/lib/libomp.dylib' above. R seems to run
happily without this file, though, until you start it with lldb:

? R -d  lldb
(lldb) target create "/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/bin/exec/R"
Current executable set to
'/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/bin/exec/R' (x86_64).
(lldb) run

    0x10002c9f8 <+20>: retq

After clang4 is installed from http://r.research.att.com/libs/
everything is fine.

Is linking to this library intentional? If yes, then maybe the web
could be updated to suggest installing clang6 and clang4?

Thanks,
Gabor

I recently migrated to a MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2018) using the Migration Assistant.  Everything went well, though there are always a few things that don't transfer such as applications installed by Brew which I installed manually.

An issue with R arose I can't solve.  The help systen opens with a blank window.

Help works when I run R from the terminal so I know the files are installed.  Help works fine on the Macintosh I used a the source for the migration so it isn't a problem I inherited.  Re-installing R (see sessionInfo below) didn't solve the problem.

Anyone have any suggestions how I can get help to work?

Hi,

I have struggled with the same issue, but have found no solution.

https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-mac/2017-September/012485.html <https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-mac/2017-September/012485.html>

I have been using RStudio in lieu of R.app.  I like RStudio, but I miss R.app.

Few things to try:

- do you see anything in the error console?

- remove (rename) any and all customization files like ~/.Rprofle ~/.RData etc.

- try running R from the console and starting the html help by hand to see if it works at all:
tools::startDynamicHelp()
help.start(browser="/usr/bin/open")

- if that works try the same from the R.app gui *before* using help:
help.start(browser="/usr/bin/open")

Cheers,
Simon

Hum, it's not like it cannot work (on iMac running High Sierra):

You might want to check if anything is non-TRUE here:

long.double     libcurl 
       TRUE        TRUE 

And you seem to have more than the defaults attached, I only have compiler and tools. Perhaps check ~/.RData and config files?:

I am not sure whether the following may cause the problem:

When I used the Migration Assistant I had some problem with X11,
and realized that the Migration Assistant did create the symbolic link:
/usr/X11 -> /opt/X11
but did not create the symbolic link:
/usr/X11R6 -> /opt/X11

Best regards,
Christian

Many thanks for your suggestions.  Not sure whether Ben?s issue is the same as mine.  Ben has problems with ?data.frame.  My issue is a blank help window when typing ?mean (or any other function).

Peter suggested checking capabilities().  They are all TRUE.

You both suggested checking configuration files.  Removing .Rprofile, .Rdata, and .Rapp.history made no difference.

Simon suggested:

Nothing noticeable in the error console, though I?m inexpert at reading it.

Help works when running R from console

No effect in R (except it opens my default browser).

You are right about Migration Assistant.  I defined both of these symbolic links manually while I was trying to solve the problem.  My help window is still blank despite their presence.

Hi, 

I am on a MBP with Mojave (10.14) and do not observe this issue in R.app, which I tested, but don't otherwise use, as I use Emacs/ESS and I don't have any issues there either.

It is not clear to me if the use of the Migration Assistant and/or Brew are germane or simply red herrings, or if either one are common to what Ben is experiencing.

That being said, my recommendation would be to completely remove your R installation. If you used the CRAN binary, it should be in:
  
  /Library/Frameworks/R.framework

I would delete the entire R folder tree from R.framework on down.

I would also delete R.app from \Applications, since that seems to be at least associated with the issue, if not an actual cause.

Once you have done the above, re-install R using the correct CRAN binary as a new, clean install.

After re-installing R, then re-install XQuartz from https://www.xquartz.org <https://www.xquartz.org/>. In theory, that should be unrelated to this issue, I believe, but it should be re-installed after installing/re-installing R in either case.

After the above, then try using help in R.app again and see what happens.

Regards,

Marc Schwartz

Hi,

The behavior I see is identical to what you describe regardless of the function (I used ?data.frame as an example).  The help commands

> ?<something>

and

> help("something")

both bring up a blank help window.  All of the other steps you have taken yield the same result on my system.

Hmm, when trying from R.app, do you see the following?

> ?data.frame
starting httpd help server ... done
> (tools::startDynamicHelp(NA))
[1] 26163

(The last bit is the port number of the HTTP server and will differ between invokations. I think you get 0 if the server isn't running and -1 if it failed to start.)

If the server is there, you could try connecting from your favourite browser at (say) http://127.0.0.1:26163/NEWS

If the server is there, but you cannot talk to it, then I suspect that a firewall is getting in the way.

Connecting to http://127.0.0.1:31048/NEWS <http://127.0.0.1:31048/NEWS> brings up NEWS as expected.

If I understand the MacOS preferences the firewall is OFF.  

I'll try the clean-then-reinstall that Marc suggests and report back.

Darn.  No joy from a complete clean-and-reinstall with a reinstall of XQuartz as Marc suggested.  It is still a blank help page.

Below is everything I can think of from the new session.

R is a collaborative project with many contributors.
Type 'contributors()' for more information and
'citation()' on how to cite R or R packages in publications.

Type 'demo()' for some demos, 'help()' for on-line help, or
'help.start()' for an HTML browser interface to help.
Type 'q()' to quit R.

You can try

debug(utils:::print.help_files_with_topic)

to see what is going on on your system.  On mine (High Sierra with help 
working), it retrieves as.environment("tools:RGUI")$aqua.browser which 
looks like

function (x, ...)
{
     x <- gsub("http://127.0.0.1", "http://localhost", x, fixed = TRUE)
     .Call("aqua.custom.print", "help-files", x)
     invisible(x)
}


If I debug this and try browseURL(x) after x is modified, I see help in 
my usual browser.  If I continue to the .Call(), it appears in the usual 
R.app browser.

Do you see something similar?

Ok, strange. I figured that there was some conflict/corruption in place with R.app that was not immediately clear.

Peter raised the possibility of a firewall issue, but I am curious as to why that would affect the use of help in R.app, but not via other environments, like the Mac Terminal app. Theoretically, it should be via similar protocols and ports in each setting, unless there is something specific that R.app does to the OS environment when running, that would inhibit the dynamic generation of the HTML pages. But if so, why just for the two of you?

It seems like the server is starting up ok, but the help pages are not being generated by Rd2HTML() in R.app.

However, it sparked a thought in my head, which is always risky, and that is, do you guys have any anti-virus/malware software running? I may be grasping at straws here, but such applications have been known to cause all kinds of flaky behaviors, that are not immediately evident nor associated with them.

One other thought. When you get the blank HTML page, presumably white background, drag the cursor around the page to try to highlight text, as if the text was also white, thus not showing against the white background. Another straw....

Regards,

Marc

No firewall; no anti-virus or other malware software

Nope.  Blank is blank.  No invisible text detected.

I also have no firewall running on the platform.  I do have anti-virus/malware and have turned it off.  The help window still renders with a blank page and there is no text captured with a copy-paste.

I tried debug() as Duncan suggested and get the following in a fresh R.app session...

Hi,

Two things:

1. Can one or both of you guys check locally on your own computers, to see if there is any difference between the output of options() in R.app, versus the output when R is run from a Terminal session. Many elements will not be germane to this issue, but others might, if there are differences.

Just wondering if some option() is altered from the default and/or causing a conflict unique to R.app.



2. Exit from R.app so that it is not running.

Then look for the file:

  ~/Library/Preferences/org.R-project.R.plist

>From what I can tell, that is the file that stores the default settings and user specific Preferences configurations for R.app.

With R.app NOT running, delete that file, or drag it to the desktop, if preferred.

Then start R.app and see what happens with help. The above .plist file, will be created new, with the new R.app session, so will return to default settings. Perhaps there is something in there screwing things up.

Hi,

Thanks for your persistence and kind help.

(1)  Comparing output of options()

R.app options() includes 

$help_type
[1] "html"

that terminal R options() does not.  Here's the diff of the two...

(2) Removing ~/Library/Preferences/org.R-project.R.plist

Starting R.app after removing the plist does not resolve the blank help window (but did restore R.app's factory-default appearance and settings.)

Hi Ben,

Ok, if I read correctly, it looks like you must have started R in the terminal using 'R --vanilla', based upon the file name below.

In that case, R should bring up help pages in the terminal using the internal text pager, as opposed to externally in a browser with HTML.

Start R in the Terminal just using 'R' and see what, if any, differences there are in the output of options() in that case.


Grasping at another straw, let's change the default browser in R.app to see if using an external browser, instead of the built-in browser, behaves differently.

As it turns out, from discussions some years ago, it is a bit more complex with R.app, as it does not honor the usual options() settings.

So, with R.app NOT running, in a terminal, use:

  defaults write org.R-project.R use.external.help YES

and hit enter.

Then, start R.app and try to use help again and see what happens.


To restore the default use of the internal R.app browser, exit R.app and in a terminal, use:

  defaults delete org.R-project.R use.external.help 

and hit enter.


See if that does anything.

Marc

Okay, that wasn't as informative as I had hoped.  Could you try the 
following:

debug(get("aqua.browser", envir = as.environment("tools:RGUI")))

then ask for help on something.  You should stop in the debugger seeing 
something like

debugging in: browser(if (encodeIfNeeded) URLencode(url) else url)
debug: {
     x <- gsub("http://127.0.0.1", "http://localhost", x, fixed = TRUE)
     .Call("aqua.custom.print", "help-files", x)
     invisible(x)
}

At the prompt, type "n" (without the quotes, followed by return) twice, 
until you are at the .Call line.  Then type

browseURL(x)

This should open your external browser.  It will either show a blank 
page, or the help page:  that will indicate whether the problem is in 
the internal browser or in the server.

Then go back to R.app, and type "c".  This should open the same help 
page in the internal browser.  It might show a blank page, or the 
regular help page:  either one would tell us something.

Hi,

In a fresh R.app session

> debug(get("aqua.browser", envir = as.environment("tools:RGUI")))
> help('help')
starting httpd help server ... done
debugging in: browser(if (encodeIfNeeded) URLencode(url) else url)
debug: {
    x <- gsub("http://127.0.0.1", "http://localhost", x, fixed = TRUE)
    .Call("aqua.custom.print", "help-files", x)
    invisible(x)
}
Browse[2]> n
debug: x <- gsub("http://127.0.0.1", "http://localhost", x, fixed = TRUE)
Browse[2]> n
debug: .Call("aqua.custom.print", "help-files", x)
Browse[2]> browseURL(x)


opens the external browser http://localhost:28450/library/utils/html/help.html <http://localhost:28450/library/utils/html/help.html>

but the browser says...

"Hmm. We?re having trouble finding that site.
We can?t connect to the server at localhost.
If that address is correct, here are three other things you can try:

    Try again later.
    Check your network connection.
    If you are connected but behind a firewall, check that Firefox has permission to access the Web."


And...

Browse[2]> c
exiting from: browser(if (encodeIfNeeded) URLencode(url) else url)

... opens the blank help window.


Finally, following up on Marc's suggestion that I invoke R without --vanilla...

Hi Ben,

A question, because as I go back and re-read both this thread and the prior one you posted on this issue, I have been presuming that when you run R from the terminal, you can successfully get help to open in an external browser.

However, given my re-read and what you now post below, I am wondering if, in fact, when running R in the terminal, you simply get the help displaying in the text pager.

I don't use RStudio, so not sure if help comes up in their own internal browser, or if it comes up in an external browser. Albeit, looking at their website, it appears to be an internal browser that stays within the IDE, in contrast to R.app opening the internal browser in an external window.

Can you confirm that when you run R from the terminal, does help appear within the terminal window in the pager, or does it come up in whatever external browser you are using, which I am guessing is Firefox based upon the output below.

Thanks,

Marc

You are correct that it only comes up in the text pager when I invoke R from the terminal (with or without --vanilla).

RStudio help works as expected in the sense that help content is rendered within the RStudio panes on the "Help" tab - just as you surmised.

Cheers (really!),
Ben

Hi Ben,

Ok, thanks for that clarification. That fundamentally alters my view of the issue.

For verification, can you start R in a terminal and then type:

  options(help_type = "html")

after which, then try help for some function (e.g. ?plot) and see what happens.

Thanks,

Marc

Just a little followup.  Switching the default browser from Firefox to Safari yields a similar message in the browser after...

Browse[2]> browseURL(x)

'Safari can't open the page "localhost:29682/library/utils/html/help.html"
because Safari can't find the server "localhost".'

Hi,

R version 3.5.1 (2018-07-02) -- "Feather Spray"

That brings up visible help in the default browser (Safari or Firefox depending upon which is set to be the default browser).

Ugggh....

I was fully expecting it to fail, given my presumptive new found wisdom...

Had it failed, then it would support the notion that R,app was irrelevant to the underlying issue with help and there was something going on with the server itself.

However, this now suggests (back to my original view), that there is something different in the manner in which R.app displays HTML help content in the built-in  browser window.

Did you try to set the help browser in R.app to use an external viewer using the command line invocation that I sent earlier?

That is, with R.app not running, in a terminal type:

  defaults write org.R-project.R use.external.help YES

Then run R.app and see what happens with ?plot.

To return R.app to use the default internal browser, close R.app and then in a terminal, type:

  defaults delete org.R-project.R use.external.help

That's the issue then.  Your system doesn't support "localhost", and 
R.app assumes it will.

I don't know enough about MacOS to guess a cause or a remedy, but that's 
what you need to fix.

Oops.  I did not try it but now have.

ben at gale ~ $ defaults write org.R-project.R use.external.help YES

Using a fresh session of R.app 

?plot 

open the external browser with... 

"Hmm. We?re having trouble finding that site.

We can?t connect to the server at localhost.
If that address is correct, here are three other things you can try:

    Try again later.
    Check your network connection.
    If you are connected but behind a firewall, check that Firefox has permission to access the Web."


Switching back ...

ben at gale ~ $ defaults delete org.R-project.R use.external.help

and starting a fresh R.app open the blank help window/

Hi,


ben at gale ~ $ ping localhost
ping: cannot resolve localhost: Unknown host

Here's /etc/hosts in its entirety.

ben at gale ~ $ more /etc/hosts
# BEGIN section for OpenVPN Client SSL sites
127.94.0.1      client.openvpn.net
127.94.0.2      openvpn-client.vpn.bigelow.org
# END section for OpenVPN Client SSL sites

I'm not currently using VPN.

Ok, I think that Peter and Duncan are on to the key issue here.

I have been trying to figure out what the difference is between displaying HTML help in R.app versus in the terminal and we now know.

If running R in R.app, where .Platform$GUI == "AQUA", the key line in the HTML browser display process is:

  x <- gsub("http://127.0.0.1 <http://127.0.0.1/>", "http://localhost <http://localhost/>", x, fixed = TRUE)

where the IP address in the help file URL ('x') is changed to localhost. That does not happen when running R from the terminal and the IP address is used.

In other words, a url something like:

  "http://127.0.0.1:27572/library/graphics/html/plot.html"

gets regex'd to:

  "http://localhost:27572/library/graphics/html/plot.html"


Typically there is an entry in /etc/hosts that maps 127.0.0.1 to localhost. If that entry is not present, then the OS does not know how to map the domain 'localhost' to a physical IP address, much like a DNS server could not map an internet domain name to a physical server IP address.

Ben, if you are not sure about how to look at /etc/hosts per Peter's message below, you can use:

  cat /etc/hosts | grep localhost

in a terminal and see what it returns.

Hi,

Ok, that confirms the issue, as surmised.

The default hosts file on macOS typically contains the following entries:

##
##
# Host Database
#
# localhost is used to configure the loopback interface
# when the system is booting. Do not change this entry.
##
127.0.0.1 localhost
255.255.255.255 broadcasthost
::1 localhost
fe80::1%lo0 localhost


Somewhere along the way, the content of that file has been changed and the above content deleted, possibly by whatever VPN configuration process was implemented at some point.

Ben, if you know how to edit and save the /etc/hosts file, which should require the admin password, add the above lines before the #BEGIN line in the file as it is now.

I would recommend saving the current version of the file, before you start editing, just in case. So, from the terminal, use something like:

  sudo cp /etc/hosts /etc/hosts.SAVE

If you are not sure how to edit the file, here is one resource:

  https://www.imore.com/how-edit-your-macs-hosts-file-and-why-you-would-want

and there are others online as well.

Once you do that, hopefully, that will resolve this issue.

Marc

Ha!  My /etc/hosts was empty (perhaps an error by Migration Assistant?).  Populating it with the /etc/hosts from the host computer (particularly defining localhost) solves the problem.

Many, many thanks for all your timely efforts and considerable help,

What? Are they born that way, or does Migration Assistent bungle things up? Or maybe OpenVPN does?

Anyways, try adding a line saying

127.0.0.1	localhost

Not born that way.  I've migrated several laptops.  This is the first time I lost /etc/hosts.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] errors opening files in R.app
Message-ID: <CAM-f3u=NvAoNT4DhpPRjcvLeEKapPkiW7cRpgqX1+L7H_XkZ8A@mail.gmail.com>

All,

I'm encountering an error when opening files in R.app and would appreciate
any thoughts. Currently I'm running R 3.5.1 and macOS 10.13.6, but I've had
the error with other recent OS and R.app versions and on my other computer.

When opening files either through File > Open Document... or file.choose()
I get something like the following message:

objc[10393]: Class FIFinderSyncExtensionHost is implemented in both
/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/FinderKit.framework/Versions/A/FinderKit
(0x7fffa7df9c90) and
/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/FileProvider.framework/OverrideBundles/FinderSyncCollaborationFileProviderOverride.bundle/Contents/MacOS/FinderSyncCollaborationFileProviderOverride
(0x1191f6cd8). One of the two will be used. Which one is undefined.

The file or path will be retrieved correctly. A significant amount of the
time R.app hangs (spinning beachball) indefinitely. To remedy, I have to
force quit R.app, rerun R.app, quit normally, and rerun R.app. If I don't
go through the process of quiting and reruning a second time, R.app will
hang 100% of the time I try to open a file.

This feels like an OS problem to me, but I'm having trouble understanding
what exactly is happening or how to fix it.

Has anyone encountered this before or has any idaes? I've searched around
but can't find any mention of my problem, but apologizes if this is old
news to folks.

Thanks for the help,

Will

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] legend function and Inf warnings
Message-ID: <2663070B-F7BC-4EB6-9614-D87E5720A304@unh.edu>

	I receive warnings() that make debugging difficult. I have two questions:

1. In this part of my script, I want my script to return ?Inf?. I receive the following warning.

In min(df12.[df12.[, 7] <= 0, 1]) :
  no non-missing arguments to min; returning Inf

Is there are command to eliminate the warning message?

2. I use the following legend that returns a plot that I am happy with and no errors:

legend("topright",
             title = "",
             legend = c(
               expression("Predictions:"),
               bquote(bar(u)[A] == .(u.a)),
               bquote(bar(u)[D] == .(u.d))
             ),
             cex = c(0.75,0.75,0.75)
             )

At the same time, I receive the following warnings:

warnings()
Warning messages:
1: In if (xc < 0) text.width <- -text.width :
  the condition has length > 1 and only the first element will be used
2: In strheight(legend, units = "user", cex = cex)/yc :
  longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object length
3: In w0 * rep.int(0:(ncol - 1), rep.int(n.legpercol, ncol)) :
  longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object length
4: In left + xchar + xextra + (w0 * rep.int(0:(ncol - 1),  ... :
  longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object length
5: In (rep.int(1L:n.legpercol, ncol)[1L:n.leg] - 1 + !is.null(title)) *  ... :
  longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object length
6: In top - 0.5 * yextra - ymax - (rep.int(1L:n.legpercol,  ... :
  longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object length
7: In xt + x.intersp * xchar :
  longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object length
8: In if (xc < 0) text.width <- -text.width :
  the condition has length > 1 and only the first element will be used
9: In if (xc < 0) text.width <- -text.width :
  the condition has length > 1 and only the first element will be used

If I remove ?bquote? from ?legend,? no warnings are produced. 

By the way, ?xc,? ?yextra?, and other variable listed are not part of my script. I have no idea what to do with the warning information.

Is there a better way to write my ?legend? code?

Thanks,
Paul

You can add another value and suppress the message:

min(c()) gives the warning, min(c(), 2) will give 2.  You'll need to 
find some value that you can distinguish from a real minimum...

Sorry, no comment on your other question.

Can I run Rstudio Server on OSX 10.13 (High Sierra). If so, can someone
please point me to install directions? I found an old post that talks about
using homebrew but I can't find the rstudio-server brew to install.

Hey! 

AFAIK you have to compile rstudio-server to install it on macOS. 

You have the ?detailed" instructions here: https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/blob/master/INSTALL <https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/blob/master/INSTALL>

I haven?t done myself in macOS so I can give you more guidance. I don?t know why they removed the formula from homebrew, but I guess it was giving problems or something.
