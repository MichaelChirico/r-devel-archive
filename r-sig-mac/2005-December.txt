My R (Version 2.2.0) has been crashing quite reliably when I try to  
save my Quartz window of graphs as a PDF.   If it makes any  
difference, my OS is 10.4.3.

Sean,
if type is set to mac.binary, then the contrib url is what reported  
by Seth (and 2.3 only applies to R-devel, no binaries available at  
the moment unless you point to a repository that builds packages  
against R-devel. I think Seth is using R-devel for his test).
If you install from source, then it should not happen that you get  
"macosx" in the url, as we only have one "path" for the sources (no  
matter the architecture).
On R-2.2.0 I get
 > contrib.url('foo')
[1] "foo/bin/macosx/powerpc/contrib/2.2"
which is correct. Cran binary of CRAN reports
 > sessionInfo()
R version 2.2.0, 2005-10-06, powerpc-apple-darwin7.9.0
so it seems to me that Sean is using a R-devel version of R-2.1.0 and  
not the final one.
The contrib.url function has been changed indeed just before official  
final release of R-2.2.0

I have now managed to get the gnlm package installed from source.  
Thanks Jan!

Adding the -lcc_dynamic flag to the Makefile does the trick. There is a  
discussion this at:

Stefano,

Thanks for these details.  That is probably the issue, as this particular R
version was a devel version.

Richard,

before I go into details, do you have a specific reason for  
recompiling GDD yourself? It is available in binary form on CRAN, so  
all you have to do is to say install.packages("GDD") and it works out  
of the box (R 2.2.0).

This seems like a problem in the installation of your libgd. Make  
sure "gdlib-config" is on your PATH (i.e. when you type gdlib-config  
you get its help and no error). That script is generated by libgd and  
provides all compilation flags necessary to link against libgd.

It seems as if your libgd is missing JPEG and PNG support. Please  
make sure you libgd has both JPEG and PNG support. Freetype and  
fontconfig are useful, too (FT is included in the Apple X11).

As I was saying earlier, it works on Mac OS X and Mac users don't  
even have to worry about compiling it at all.

Cheers,
Simon

Possibly you may want to notify the package maintainer that his  
package is broken by not using all necessary linker flags from R. If  
you compile an R package using R makefiles, it will supply - 
lcc_dynamic automatically. It is discouraged to use custom Makefiles  
in packages as they are neither portable nor reliable - and in most  
cases unnecessary.

Can you, please, test a more recent version of the R.app GUI?  
Preferably the most recent debug version obtainable from
http://research.att.com/~urbanek/R/
(bottom of the page). There was an issue with saving files in general  
when non-ASCII characters were used that was fixed recently. If it's  
an another issue, please send us the crash report based on the debug  
version.

Thanks,
Simon

PS: does the same problem occur when using:
quartz.save("plot.pdf",type="pdf")
instead?

Just another note. On Jim Lindsey's site, you can find the suggestion:

MAC Users: if you have problems compiling a library, try removing the
Makefile from the src directory.

This always has worked for me although I find that I need to compile
from the terminal command line.

In general, I've found the author very responsive to fixing the smallest bug
that might arise in these packages.

Yesterday I installed all the Lindsey packages with gcc/gfortran 4.0.1.

Except for one or two small trivial changes because of "old" fortran,  
there
were no problems whatsoever. Also, if you use the new cctools from
Xcode-2.2 there is no need for cc_dynamic.

As far as I can see there are no reasons for using gcc-3.x any more,
because most package authors now have corrected the "old" fortran
code.

changed them

3. In repeated, file binnest.f, line 638, the statement

Gradient(t1+t2+kk) = Gradient(t1+t2+kk) + (D1_Sig2(kk) / Li

is too long -- I removed some spaces and it compiles fine.

Seem to remember Ripley bringing up some issues with
gfortran bugs/optimization on rdev a while back. Were
those resolved?

Is there a plan for handling the binary distributions
for the differing ABIs?

I didn't re-iterate on gcc4 recently (will do later this month), but  
the last status was that the stdio problem persists, some simple  
Fortran code segfaults, but R will pass make check (when linked to  
static libgfortran) - so yes, it's possible. Right now I'm slightly  
out of spare cycles, but I plan to experiment with universal R binary  
later this month and that involves producing full binaries using  
gcc4 ...

Jan, if you have a spare minute, can you run some benchmarks of your  
gcc4-optimized R (preferably involving mostly Fortran code vs just C)  
against the CRAN binary? That would be quite helpful in assessing the  
current speed benefits...

> Is there a plan for handling the binary distributions for the

Yes in the sense that they will be separate. We have added one more  
directory level to the Mac binaries for that reason.

However, the ABI-fix currently applies to R internal code only, so  
packages that need those specific LAPACK functions will be on their  
own. I guess it would be possible to use a more elaborate fix or  
provide additional entry points, but there was no need (yet?).

Cheers,
Simon

In the past I used

sink("timings.lis")
hilbert<-function(n) 1/(outer(seq(n),seq(n),"+")-1)
print("hilbert n=500")
print(system.time(eigen(hilbert(500))))
print(system.time(eigen(hilbert(500))))
print(system.time(eigen(hilbert(500))))
print("hilbert n=1000")
print(system.time(eigen(hilbert(1000))))
print(system.time(eigen(hilbert(1000))))
print(system.time(eigen(hilbert(1000))))
print("sort n=6")
print(system.time(sort(rnorm(10^6))))
print(system.time(sort(rnorm(10^6))))
print(system.time(sort(rnorm(10^6))))
print("sort n=7")
print(system.time(sort(rnorm(10^7))))
print(system.time(sort(rnorm(10^7))))
print(system.time(sort(rnorm(10^7))))
sink()

would that do ?

This is on a quad (2 x 2 x 2.5 Ghz) G5 with OS X 10.4.4 and 2GB of RAM.

hilbert() will spend most of its time in vecLib, so there is  
obviously very little
difference. For loess we see a speedup of about 5% -- not very  
impressive. Certainly not
since it comes from both a compiler difference and a difference in  
optimization flags. But
since there is no use of SMP and no single precision floating point,  
we can't expect
too much from the optimization anyway. Moral: if you want to run your  
R faster, upgrade
your CPU.

Hi All,

I just produced a new R logo icon. It's almost exactly the same as  
the one supplied by the R.app, but the resloution is better. I  
downloaded the R logo as a PNG file from the R developer site and  
worked from there with PS and Icon Composer. If the developer of R  
for OSX want it I'd be glad to share it.

Thanks for the effort, but AFAIR Stefano has created a new hi-res  
logo some time ago which is available at high resolutions on this page:
http://developer.r-project.org/Logo/

However, for the GUI I would suggest a more Aqua-like logo.  A while  
ago I created a sample which you'll find at
http://www.rosuda.org/misc/Rgui.icns
(you'll need to download it and look at it in the Finder preview or  
the icon composer)

It's not great (the R should be thicker), but I guess you get the  
idea. If you are PS-savvy, like to do such things and have some spare  
time, you could give it a shot ...

Thanks,
Simon

can you, please, supply us with some critical details such as how you  
installed and/or compiled RMySQL and whether you have a custom or  
CRAN version of R?

I just had (and posted about) the exact same error message.  I found  
it went away after updating Xcode to 2.2.  I also made a change to  
SHLIB (though I don't know if that made a difference), which I can  
look up when I am at my other computer.

I limited myself to make a .icns of the high res R Logo, so it look
quite different form yours. I don't know if I'll ever have the time to
aquafy it. In the meantime, if anyone whats it I'd be happy to share.

hi.  you may have found my postings on this topic in the archives from about a month back.  i had somewhat different problems with RMySQL, but all my problems were resolved after I re-installed MySQL from source and RMySQL from source (both with default compiler 3.3).

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] sizing of quartz and x11 windows
Message-ID: <7122A8D7-6286-400C-BC56-B65BADF4B261@mac.com>

whenever i open an x11 or quartz window, the dimensions of the window  
are roughly 74% and 72%, respectively, of what i call for.  for example:

quartz(width=3, height=4) leads to a window that is roughly 2.15  
inches by 2.9 inches, and
x11(width=3, height=4) leads to a window that is roughly 2.21 inches  
by 3 inches

i am using dual apple cinema 23" displays set at the 1920x1200  
resolution.

can anyone point me in the direction of understanding why this is  
happening?

The general answer is that your pixels are not squares but they are  
vertical rectangles, so what you expect is not what you see.
As for the small difference in quartz vs x11 I think is because of  
the resizing square at the bottom-right of the quartz window. So you  
should measure up to that square and you should get the same height.
You should notice this effect by creating 3x3 window and look that  
indeed it appears as a rectangle.
hope this helps

quartz(w=3,h=3) gives me a 2 6/32" square window (not including the  
banner, but including the resizing square).

the measured discrepency between x11 and quartz seems to scale  
linearly with the size of the windows (an x11 window being 1/64, 6/64  
and 12/64" bigger in the 1, 3 and 6" cases), but for both x11 and  
quartz the resizing square is within the measured square region, so i  
am not sure the resizing square is the source of the discrepency.

i am more wondering why 3" in the function call turns into 2 6/32"  
displayed.  is this a standard error for everyone, or is it just my  
monitor/card-combo that creates it?  and if it's standard, why have a  
function that purports to deliver a measurement?

R.app currently provides no customization of the default console font  
in the preferences, save for the font size. Changes made using the  
font menu are not explicitly handled and the behavior is quite  
interesting (at least on Tiger you can change the prompt/input font,  
but not the output font), given that 'multiple fonts allowed' is  
disabled in the text. I will put it on the ToDo list, but I am not  
sure how easy it is to implement...

I used R 2.1.1, installed from the CRAN binary.  RMySQL I built from source, version 0.5-5,
on top of XML (0.97-8)  and DBI (0.1-9).

I did all this at home, on OSX 10.4.3, but only after installing the latest 
MySQL binary -- version 5.0.16-standard.  

Repeating the installation at work, using MySQSL 4.1.10-max, everything worked fine.
I'm afraid to upgrade MySQL from 4.1. to 5.0.  

Has anyone else had any luck with MySQL 5.0 and RMySQL?

Thanks!

 - Paul

yes.  i am running MySQL 5.0.15 and R 2.2.0.  everything appears to  
work fine now, although I've found that MySQL "goes away" (I believe  
that is close to the syntax from the R error message--can't replicate  
right now) if I don't call to it for a long period of time. not sure  
whether that is a bug or security measure.

The discrepancy comes from the fact that the DPI density is not  
necessarily calibrated exactly to your monitor. I don't remember what  
Quartz uses (it is initialized to 72dpi, but I see no code that  
changes it later), but the DPI for X11 is usually set to an arbitrary  
default of 75 or 100 (see xdpyinfo|grep resol) which may not match  
your display (in fact my 23" Apple display has 99.5x98.3 DPI  
according to OS X so Apple knows what they're doing). You can use the  
-dpi argument to specify your real DPI in X11. As of Quartz, unless  
there is a way to set ipr in R directly I don't think you can change  
it. Given that most modern displays have at least 100dpi, I'd vote to  
change the Quartz default to 100...

Cheers,
Simon

Ok.
I tested with the R.app GUI  (R-GUI-Debug) from the web page you  
mentioned.  I used the one under "Built for R 2.2.x" because the one  
for 2.3.x didn't work with my R and I didn't see an R 2.3 at cran.r- 
project.org to download.  This also crashed when presented with the  
same problem.  I have attached my bug report.

> quartz.save("plot.pdf",type="pdf")
The quartz.save command did save without crashing, but the PDF it  
produced was of a decidedly odd phenotype with backwards blue writing  
over a large part of it.  If you don't know what I mean, I'd be happy  
to send that along also.

If I can do anything else to help, I'd be glad to.
?

I use TextWrangler http://www.barebones.com as a general editor. It's  
free and fairly powerful. I haven't set up any integration with R,  
but this should be possible if someone wants to do some work, as  
there are possibilities for source colouring, applescripting and  
plugin extensions. I just save the files and then Source File in R.

I'm sorry this is my fault - it shouldn't say "R 2.3" - it should say  
"R-devel", because there is no such thing as R 2.3.x yet. Using  
"Built for R 2.2x" is absolutely correct.

Thank you. Unfortunately the bug is hard to track, because at the  
crash-point there should be no dynamically allocated buffer, so it  
means there was a memory corruption before ... I'll see if I can  
reproduce it somehow. If not, I'll need your help to print the values  
of some variables - do you have Xcode developer tools installed on  
your machine?

Cheers,
Simon

Kevin,

Just to make sure:

You are aware that there is an editor built in to the R.app GUI, right?  Once you open R.app, go to the file menu and use new or open. 

For more serious tasks I use xemacs and emacs speaks statistics http://ess.r-project.org/.  For this you will need to be running X11.

Xcode is nice, but the R support is limited to some syntax  
highlighting (which was posted on this list some time ago).  
Personally I use either the integrated editor in the R GUI or Emacs  
(Carbon Emacs 22.0.50 to be more precise). Both have good R  
integration (i.e. not just syntax highlighting, but also auto- 
completion of functions, objects and argument lookup). The integrated  
R GUI editor is more suitable for beginners, Emacs is ... well,  
Emacs :) powerful if you know how to use it (and it's the only one  
with Rd mode AFAIK). I have also heard that SubEthaEdit is a really  
good editor with R syntax highlighting support, but never used it  
myself.

Cheers,
Simon

I've written a BBEdit syntax coloring module for R language.  I think  
it might work with the free TextWrangler too.  If anyone wants a  
copy, email me.

Not true. ESS works fine in the many versions of Carbon Emacs and in  
the Carbon
Xemacs.

One nice feature of the R GUI integrated editor is the ability to run an R command from within the editor.  It also looks and feels like the App itself, which is nice.

I have found that Emacs does a better job with auto-indentation, and have also made use of Emac's backup automation features.  Emacs can probably do the "run a command from the editor trick" (it unclogged my toilet the other day); I just haven't figured out how to make it happen yet.

As several people have replied, Emacs is by far the preferred choice  
for most serious R developers. Using the ESS package with Emacs  
provides you with an interface to R which goes beyond just syntax  
highlightning. An example (which Simon has already described): you  
can press a key combination to start looking up in the help system.  
Typing plot. and pressing TAB will then give you alist of help pages  
for functions starting with plot. amongst the loaded packages. This  
is extremely useful. There are other features such as the ability to  
send a single line of code or a single function to R (instead of  
sourcing the whole script). For package writes there are also nice  
modes for .Rd files and (in case you use it) saved transcript files  
(you can eg. say you entire transcript from an R session and remove  
all the output, leaving only the commands as a sourcable R script.).  
Ess supports Sweave documents as well.

Emacs has other advantages:
* it is truly cross-platform, a big advantage if you are also using  
*NIX servers and/or windows
* it supports basically any kind of language out there, so if you  
write in a set of different language, it makes sense to use a single  
editor
* One small lifesaver for statisticians (and others): it supports  
rectangular cut and paste: imagine being able to cut out a column  
from a table...

Other editors does the same, but the functionality of the ESS package  
is to my knowledge not present in any other editor, making Emacs a  
first choice for R users.

Having said all of that, Emacs is a big program (which btw. is older  
than dos), with some learning curve. It will take you a long time  
before you feel totally at home in it. And you will spend the first  
couple of months cursing about the strange key combinations and the  
small quirks. So do not even think of using it unless you plan to do  
more than write 10 lines of R code.

As Jan has said: you do not in any way need to run X11 to run Emacs,  
although it makes sense to use x11 to plot graphics.

Other people have suggested other editors for the causal user.

This is a related remark to this topic and the icon topic of last week.
I'm not sure how file associations work between OS X apps and their 
extensions, however R.app doesn't appear to "own" any file extensions 
when it is installed, and they have generic or blank icons. Perhaps the 
individual keen on making icons from the email discussion last week 
could make new icons for "*.R" files, which might look like R-code with 
the R logo; an icon for "*.RData" which could look like those DB 
cylinders with the R logo; and another icon for "*.Rd" files 
(document-like text with the R logo?).
I forget if I had to manually get the "*.RData" extension to "Open 
with..." R.app, but this should be an automatic association after 
install; same goes for the "*.R" files.
The default behavior for double-clicking an "*.R" file should not open 
XCode, and should not be associated with an XCode "*.r" Resource Manager 
file icon. (I'm defiantly not sure if app file ownership in OS X is case 
sensitive, because in an ideal UNIX world "*.r" extensions and "*.R" are 
different, which they are in this case.)
Anyways, just a thought.

editors and distribute them with the R installer.
What do you think SImon?

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] R 2.2 crash
Message-ID: <83bbe6a50b5d45317c587e60fab9caa0@mindspring.com>

I have installed R2.2 (R Cocoa GUI 1.13 (1915)) on my B&W 350 Powermac 
(640MB)  running OS 10.3.8. The program crashes on boot. The crash file 
is as follows:

Host Name:      Tracy-Lightcaps-Computer.local
Date/Time:      2005-12-06 13:12:14 -0500
OS Version:     10.3.8 (Build 7U16)
Report Version: 2

Command: R
Path:    /Applications/R.app/Contents/MacOS/R
Version: 1.13 (1915)
PID:     652
Thread:  Unknown

I already had R 2.1 on the machine and installed R 2.2 as an update 
from a disk image without removing the older application. 
Interestingly, the installer reported R 2.2 as a downgrade instead of 
an upgrade on installation; I assumed this was a bug. When R 2.2 failed 
to boot, I removed R.app and tried reinstallation from the disk image 
with the same result. It looks like part of dylib didn't install.  Any 
ideas about what is going on here?

ctr-c ctr-j  runs the line

Furthermore, if I ever got around to doing anything else with the  
Xcode stuff, it would be aimed towards the package developer and not  
the R user. In my copious spare time, of course.

I'm a big fan of emacs. On the mac Aquaemacs allows avoiding some of  
the odd keystrokes that emacs normally requires. It's now pretty  
mature, and works pretty well in genl.

Right.  What I should have said is that I haven't found a carbon version of emacs or xemacs that I like as well as the X11 based xemacs. The last time I tried this was perhaps 6 months ago with Andrew Choi's port of Xemacs.  It was nice, but at that time window functions seemed to bog down with long files (scrolling, etc, I think...I can't remember its been a while).  And it seemed like Andrew might not be interested in continuing on the project.  I see, however, that he has.

Jan (or others) which carbon emacs or xemacs do you prefer? 

Thanks,

Julin

apple recommends

http://home.att.ne.jp/alpha/z123/emacs-mac-e.html  (comes with ESS)

but

http://aquamacs.org/index.shtml
http://emacs-on-aqua.sourceforge.net/

are interesting too and may eventually be better than the more classical
emacs-mac

i never seriously used xemacs -- so dont know about that one

This is a really important feature but BBEdit and Alpha also
support it (option-click-drag)

Well, I guess a first thing would be to place them at the CRAN site  
under "other" where WinEdt and ESS gets linked to, and the a2ps  
stylesheets are.

Having something in the MacOSX FAQ world make sense as well.

There are a lot of options for editing. Any Emacs version takes time,
but it's probably worth it if you do a lot of work in R. Another
option is jedit, an open source editor written in java. It has an R
mode you can download for it.

There is a good trick to know for working with editors that don't have
direct R integration: file.choose(). file.choose() will pop up an OS
native file selection box so you don't have to cut and paste paths
into the R monitor.

I've been keeping a blog of R notes at http://r-notes.blogspot.com.
There is an entry there on file.choose().

In light of the massive response I've gotten (at least 5 emails),  
I've put the BBEdit/TextWrangler R language module on my webserver.   
You can access it at http://www.smalltime.com/gene/R.plist

The file goes in "~/Library/Application Support/BBEdit/Language  
Modules/" for BBEdit and in "~/Library/Application Support/ 
TextWrangler/Language Modules/" for TextWrangler (thanks Dan) or the  
corresponding global Library locations.


Philippe, Dan Putler suggested I forward you this information for  
listing on the R-GUI page.

Hi Kevin,
I prefer Emacs with ESS. It is fairly easy to install, and includes syntax
highlighting and interfacing with R. The keyboard shortcuts are a little
awkward at first, but make life *much* easier in the long run. I've only
been using it for a few months, and I'm very happy with it.

Best,
Randy

since this topic is pretty popular, let me mention a problem i have  
found with the integrated editor from R.app:

the "undo typing" command seems to remove an arbitrary number of  
keystrokes.  at times, i will make a mistake, then when i go to undo  
it, i find the editor has undone not only my mistake but a  
significant amount of prior work.  it is difficult to produce a  
replicable example, because i am not sure whether the number of  
keystrokes that are undone is a function of time between the  
keystrokes, or some other grouping mechanism.   i apologize for not  
including one.

just wondering, has anyone else experienced this?  is it a bug, or a  
setting?

Marije,

please note that R 2.1.1 is outdated and there have been many  
improvements especially in the GUI ever since.

But the package is loaded, right? I guess it's just a warning from  
the package manager, that checks for your personal packages and finds  
none. However, I cannot reproduce it using the current R...

Well a badly configured Windows system, yes :) You can have multiple  
users in XP, too, and you shouldn't be using the Admin user, although  
many do...

FWIW you can avoid that in any emacs - that's what .emacs is for ;).  
I prefer the 'real' emacs compiled as Carbon app which is really  
stable and behaves as it should - the other clones sometimes don't so  
I'd avoid them. I guess I'll make an 'editors for R' page on the OS X  
wiki when I get back and we can put stuff like this there ...

Good to know - we could build it into the integrated Mac GUI editor  
as well - any other wishes? The Xmas shall be jolly, so I could put  
in a feature or two ;) ..

The problem is to decide when to put in a checkpoint. Right now, we  
are forcing them only after <Enter> which is ok for usual work, but  
if you are only fixing a line here or there then those won't be  
checked in. Should we use some time-based limit? Cocoa's default is  
to place no checkpoints so it's not a help :P

Simon

Last time I checked it was very slooooow - good if you like to drink

Well on a Mac I prefer drag and drop which is even faster than typing  
those commands ...

"Which emacs?" is the source of huge flames (firestorms ?) on the 
macosx-emacs lists, of course.  Aquaemacs is good at providing a natural 
Mac feel & compatibility; if you mainly do  a variety of tasks on Mac OS 
X I find it helps your interactions go smoothly.  And recent versions 
have been better at stability.  The maintainers are very responsive, 
almost as good as the Mac R team ;-).

OTOH if you do emacs on different platforms a lot, then you may find 
Aquaemacs disconcerting.  (I'm more in the former camp these days, but 
sympathize with both.)

Since you mentioned christmas - ideal might be a short time limit (10 
s?) and multiple undos. Knowing how the checkpoint is set already 
helps a great deal.

i think time-based might be awkward because if you don't type for a while, your first several (potentially many) strokes of the undo command would have no effect.  maybe a certain number of keystrokes?  whatever aquamacs does works fine by me, so i would mimic if possible.

You may want to update your system - it is outdated. The CRAN version  
of R is compiled on 10.3.9 which is the current Panther version.  
Please let us know if the error still persists after system update.

Message-ID: <20051214171030.43036.qmail@web32415.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Dear Mac-Rs,

I had one R Console open.
When I tried to open another R Console from shell
script, it gave me an error message " line 6: 590
Segmentation fault ${_PATH}/R". Do you all have idea
what is going on and how to fix it? 

What I am trying to do is to load two datasets in
different workspaces, so I can compare results from
both outputs. It may have better solution which allow
one work with two .RData but in the same Console. 

I don't know if I explained it well.

Thanks for your input.

Kevin

I wonder how you were able to install the Windows version of the  
package, it should not be possible ... Anyway, in order to delete a  
package manually, start Terminal and type the following:

sudo rm -rf /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/library/PKG

where PKG is the name of the package you want to delete. If you  
installed the package in you user directory instead, take the Finder  
and look in your home -> Library -> R -> library. You should see the  
package there as a folder - just delete the folder with Finder.

Simon

Hi there,
This is pretty trivial:

Sys.time()        -->  "2005-11-09 03:18:32 GMT"
Sys.timezone() -->  ""

i.e., Sys.time works, and knows where I am (I think ? perhaps GMT is an
accident of living on the prime meridian), but timezone is an empty string.

      'Sys.timezone' returns an OS-specific character string, possibly
      an empty string.

and it's as simple as
as.vector(Sys.getenv("TZ"))

However, TZ is only used to *override the default timezone* (as per  
POSIX) so by default you get an empty string.

... and the only place on Earth where Windows and unix actually agree  
on the time ;).

For the BBEdit/TextWrangler users.

If you do not use it already, you may find the following Applescript  
helpful:

set selectedText to selection as string
tell application "R"
	activate
	cmd selectedText
end tell

It is very basic but it works. If you write some R code in BBEdit you  
can select some commands there, select the Applescript via the menu  
or a keyboard shortcut, and the commands are executed in the R console.

To create the script just open the script editor in BBEdit, copy the  
code into the editor, compile it, and save the script into '~/Library/ 
Application Support/BBEdit/Scripts/'. You will find the script in the  
Applescript menu. You may want to set a keyboard shortcut (Window >  
Palettes > Scripts menu and then Set Key).

Emacs has a diff built in.

Since you are using Emacs already, you might try M-x ediff.  But
before you do that, you can read the help for it via C-h f ediff.

just for completeness, there is a very nice utility in Developer/ 
Applications/Utilities called "FileMerge". It is much nicer than diff  
and also allows you to create a resulting file by specifying which  
parts you want from which file. It is too intuitive and easy to use  
for Emacs users but I though I'll mention it anyway ;).

Cheers,
Simon
