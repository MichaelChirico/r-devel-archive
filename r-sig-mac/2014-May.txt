Ian,

Given your situation, you may want to consider using Fink at least for a while for the reasons below.

1. Fink's R is stored in /sw, and allows another (.pkg or HomeBrew installed) R.
2. You may delete /sw if you don't like it.
3. Fink provides several Marvericks binaries of CRAN packages in dpkg format.  See
  http://bindist.finkproject.org/10.9/dists/stable/main/binary-darwin-x86_64/sci/
4. The CRAN binaries are linked to Fink's R, don't affect another R if installed.
5. The CRAN binaries are stored in /sw/share, so another R can install its CRAN packages in $HOME.
6. Fink is aware of compiler issues.  C++ packages on Marvericks are linked to libc++, not libstdc++.

The drawbacks are:
1. You need to learn how to use Fink.
2. Fink's CRAN packages are slightly older than official.

I was a little hesitant to use them as your linked e-mail lists rgdal in both the ?it?s okay to use the binaries? category, and the ?it?s missing for good reason? category so I wasn?t entirely sure if a subtle binary incompatibility might crop up.

Message-ID: <94B94483-43C8-4B2F-83C5-B1966B93C6A4@comcast.net>

Dear Hannes or anybody;

I did not find any pages (despite searching) for the installation process of MonetDB on a Mac. I'm currently running MacOS 10.7.5 and R 3.1.0 Patched (2014-04-21 r65431) -- "Spring Dance". There is a source package for MonetDB at:

https://www.monetdb.org/downloads/MacOSX/Jan2014-SP1/MonetDB-11.17.13-x86_64-Darwin-9-bin.tar.bz2

It's home page has direction for installation on Linux and PC but makes no mention of Macs. Downloading that file resulted in a couple of automatic steps and the creation in my ~/Download/ directory of a hierarchy of usr2/local/monetdb

Reading the MacOS R-FAQ in "For R.app you may need to add e.g. /usr/local/bin and it is usually most convenient to use command-line R." Reasoning that the files in monetdb should actually go into usr/local/ I dragged them to that location with Finder.app, and authenticated when requested.

(This process failed and I am now looking for instruction on properly installing on a Mac. Is this page going to lead me on the path of righteousness?

https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/porting/conceptual/portingunix/compiling/compiling.html

My reading of Mac-SIG leads me to believe that using MacPorts will not be a stable strategy for interaction with R.

========= failed efforts recorded below ==================

I installed MonetDB.R from R.app using the Package installation dialog with "install dependencies" checked. 

library(MonetDB.R) # succeeded without complaint and reported:

Loading required package: DBI
Loading required package: digest

help(package="MonetDB.r")  # Trying the Example code in monetdb.server.setup

Then tried the code on the help page for 'MonetDB.R-package'

Error in .local(drv, ...) : Could not connect to localhost:50000

> d <- dbReadTable(conn, "iris")
Error in is(object, Cl) : 
  error in evaluating the argument 'conn' in selecting a method for function 'dbReadTable': Error: object 'conn' not found

So obviously there is something about this client server setup that I have not done properly or understood how to access. I've been through the R-FAQ many times and still do not understand the issues surrounding the use of homebrew and MacPorts. It's something to do with binary files in the right places and I fear this is another instance of such failure.

(I'm also unable to scroll the Mac-FAQ to see the end of the file when the window is wider than about 60 characters.)

The error message looks as if you need /bin on the end of the path:
it's looking for /usr/local/monetdb/mserver5 but the file is probably
/usr/local/monetdb/bin/mserver5

Personally, I start the server from the Terminal command line, per
http://www.monetdb.com/Documentation/monetdbd

First time only
/usr/local/monetdb/bin/monetdbd create ~/my-dbfarm

Subsequent times:
Before starting R
/usr/local/monetdb/bin/monetdbd start ~/my-dbfarm

After exiting R
/usr/local/monetdb/bin/monetdbd start ~/my-dbfarm

Both of those commands run without error from the Terminal.app command line. When I execute one of the suggested commands in the Documentation page, I get:

david-winsemiuss-mac-pro:~ davidwinsemius$ monetdbd get all ~/my-dbfarm
-bash: monetdbd: command not found

But if I give it a full path it succeeds:
david-winsemiuss-mac-pro:~ davidwinsemius$ /usr/local/monetdb/bin/monetdbd get all ~/my-dbfarm
   property            value

mapisock         /tmp/.s.monetdb.50000
controlsock      /tmp/.s.merovingian.50000

So I think I may need to add /usr/local/monetdb/bin/ to my bash PATH.


 Adding it to my Sys.path may be needed as well because the help page example still fails:

> library(MonetDB.R)
Loading required package: DBI
Loading required package: digest
> conn <- dbConnect(MonetDB.R(), "monetdb://localhost/demo")
Error in .monetAuthenticate(socket, dbname, user, password, language = language) : 
  Authentication error: !monetdbd: no such database 'demo', please create it first

> Sys.getenv()['PATH']
                                                                                                                                  PATH 
"/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/sw/bin:/sw/sbin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/texbin:/usr/X11/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin" 

I finally decide that was not needed after working through a bit more of the documentation going back and forth between the bash console and the R console:

> conn <- dbConnect(MonetDB.R(), "monetdb://david-winsemiuss-mac-pro.local/demo")
Error in .monetAuthenticate(socket, dbname, user, password, language = language) : 
  Authentication error: !monetdbd: no such database 'demo', please create it first

So I tried creating it with:

david-winsemiuss-mac-pro:~ davidwinsemius$ /usr/local/monetdb/bin/monetdb create demo
created database in maintenance mode: demo

> conn <- dbConnect(MonetDB.R(), "monetdb://david-winsemiuss-mac-pro.local/demo")
Error in .monetAuthenticate(socket, dbname, user, password, language = language) : 
  Authentication error: !monetdbd: database 'demo' is under maintenance

So I ran the next command from the MonetDB documentation:

david-winsemiuss-mac-pro:~ davidwinsemius$ /usr/local/monetdb/bin/monetdb start demo
starting database 'demo'... done

Then the example code runs:

> conn <- dbConnect(MonetDB.R(), "monetdb://david-winsemiuss-mac-pro.local/demo")
> dbListTables(conn)
character(0)
> data(iris)
> dbWriteTable(conn, "iris", iris)
[1] TRUE
> dbGetQuery(conn, "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM iris;")
   L1
1 150
> d <- dbReadTable(conn, "iris")
> str(d)
'data.frame':	150 obs. of  5 variables:
 $ sepal_length: num  5.1 4.9 4.7 4.6 5 5.4 4.6 5 4.4 4.9 ...
 $ sepal_width : num  3.5 3 3.2 3.1 3.6 3.9 3.4 3.4 2.9 3.1 ...
 $ petal_length: num  1.4 1.4 1.3 1.5 1.4 1.7 1.4 1.5 1.4 1.5 ...

 $ species     : chr  "setosa" "setosa" "setosa" "setosa" ...

I still need to add the ../monetdb/bin location to my bash PATH, but I think I can figure than out


Thank you for your assistance, Thomas.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] rgeos and rgdal binary packages for Mavericks
Message-ID: <53707BE9.5050002@stats.ox.ac.uk>

I have put statically-linked packages up on CRANxtras for the CRAN 
Mavericks distribution.  To use,

setRepositories(ind = c(1,6))  # so you get the dependencies from CRAN
install.packages(c('rgeos', 'rgdal'))

[It is nothing like so easy to do from the R.app menus.]

rgdal is compiled against the latest GDAL 1.11.0 and has a good range of 
GDAL and OGR drivers compiled in.

However, any packages which depend on these will need to compiled from 
source unless/until binaries are built for the main CRAN repository.

These were only tested with command-line R, and I did not know R.app 
(which I never use) was different.  Now fixed for use with R.app.

Thanks for the report.

Two possibilities from 
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11958643/how-do-i-prevent-the-the-package-was-signed-with-an-invalid-certificate-warnin 
:

1) Your security settings might allow only downloads from the App Store 
(look at System Preferences | Security & Privacy | General).

2) Your certificate chain is broken.

Also, check your OS is fully updated: some googling shows Apple updates 
as a cause for similar problems.

Again: that is not a signature: it is a 'hash' or 'checksum' or 'digest'.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] tip bar parameters: can it be modified to show specific
	S3 method parameter lists?
Message-ID: <5FB5AB9B-B054-414A-AEF0-329BF3669BEE@gmail.com>

It blows windows people away when they see the "tip bar? (the bottom bar that shows function parameters) display all the parameters for an obscure function.

It similarly dismays mac users when it shows something un-explainatory like

function_I_havent_used_for_ages(x, ?) # i.e., ? instead of the list for the specific S3 the user wants

Question: Is there are way to 

1. modify the function bar so that if the user, for instance, fills in parameter 1, the tip updates with the parameters for that hanlder.

so "plot(? would show the following in the bottom bar:

plot(x,y,?)

but  "plot(myOpenMxModel,"
would show
plot(myOpenMxModel, std = T, digits = 2, dotFilename = "name", pathLabels = c("none", "labels", "both?), showFixed = F, showError = T, precision = NULL)

2. With lots of parameters, the font size is too small (the list wraps and instead of the bar doubling in height, the font halves: If it was possible to either increase or fix the font size and grow the boar height, that would be great!

thanks,
tim

Thank you very much for doing this Brian! 
It worked splendidly and saved me the trouble of building 
from source.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Passing external data to R
Message-ID: <6E601D64-3EAB-4592-9525-1FF7E9E3E0CD@mac.com>

Hi,

Is there a way to pass data and/or commands to R from an external program? For example, let's say I have a Cocoa program (that I'm writing) and R running in the background. Is there a mechanism where I can send data to R such that it will be accessible from the console window? Can I send data and a plot command to open a window in R and plot it there?

More generally, is there a cross-platform mechanism for this as well? I've been searching but haven't come up with anything great. I did find RPy2 where one could send data and plotting commands to R, but the plot I made was modal which isn't great.

Thanks!

Demitri

Ok, I'm biased here, but for me (and my students!) the simple procedure is:

1. Install the R binary from CRAN;

2. Install my Emacs distribution for OS X that comes bundled with ESS: http://vgoulet.act.ulaval.ca/en/emacs/mac

3. Enjoy.

I agree. I believe (correct me if I am wrong) that if you install R in any other way, including Homebrew, you cannot install and use binary CRAN and Bioconductor packages. Which means you have to have a development environment on your machine and you have to wait for every package to build from source.

Which means you have to have a development environment on your machine and you have to wait for every package to build from source.

It is slightly wrong: you can build R from the sources emulating how it 
is done for CRAN (and r.research.att.com): then type = 
"mac.binary.mavericks" will work.  But very few people would have a need 
of that.

However, the coverage for the Mavericks binary packages on CRAN is still 
not as good as for Snow Leopard, and if you primarily use binary 
packages we recommend the Snow Leopard CRAN binary.  The benefits of the 
Mavericks build come when installing packages from sources.

I am using R & emacs (the version provided by [1]) installed via homebrew, ESS and org-mode installed
From git, and it works without problems for me.

I somehow prefer to install all packages fro source, which works
nicely, and one needs s-code anyway when using homebrew.

Be aware, that gfortran is not available anymore:

,----
| $ brew search gfortran
| GNU Fortran is now provided as part of GCC, and can be installed with:
|   brew install gcc
`----

I don't know which one I followed, but so far all look more or less
correct. I would suggest to follow the first one, and look at error
messages, and then follow these.

Be aware that if you install R and gfortran from the official R repos
(or Simons), the gfortran *will* interfere with homebrew's R (unless my
memory is misleading me completely). I had to completely remove it
before installing R from homebrew. Also: when swithching, you have to
re-compile *all your installed packages* due to different compiler
versions. This (and the from Prof Ripley later mentioned limited
availability of packages for R in binary) is the reason why I am using
the homebrew installation of R and compiling all packages from source -
no problems so far.

Cheers and keep us posted about your success / problems,

Rainer

There are differning opinions about Aquamacs (Macified version of emacs
and bundled with some packages) or emacs - I decided (after using Linux
for several years) to use emacs, due to 

1) compatibility with other OS (different config files for emacs and
Aquamacs)
2) Same keyboard shortcuts between OS
3) newer versions of emacs then used in Aquamacs

But I am sure Aquamacs makes some things easier then using emacs, but I
think emacs fits better tigether with the idea of using homebrew, while
Aquamacs fits better to the approach of using native Mac installers.

Cheers,

Rainer

Hmm, maybe. I try not to go beyond the things that are settable via Customize, and that seems to be pretty much the same as in plain Emacs (and Emacs itself has changed things between versions too.) Except for a few TeX convenience settings (electric braces, math mode on by default) what I change is mostly machine-specific anyway (fonts, modifier keys).

> 2) Same keyboard shortcuts between OS

For the common things, you actually have both the Mac and the Emacs Shortcuts available. I.e., you can either mark out a region and do c-w / c-y or cmd-x / cmd-v to cut and paste. It is mostly a matter of self discipline to avoid the standard commands.

Currently, both are at 24.3. The emacs that ships with Mavericks is at 22.1, though.

My statement is based on reading and on initial tries to get Aquamacs
working with my config which I failed, while the normal emacs loaded the
config from linux immediately (after the packages required were installed).

Agreed here.

Yes - currently. 

and don't get me started on the default versions included on the mac -
it sometimes sounds like a technology museum of ancient computer history
...

But as I said below, I am sure Aquamacs will do the job as well and
possibly faster to get going then traditional emacs.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Running R on Mac OS10.9.3 [cf. Best installation
 approach of R on Mavericks]
Message-ID: <537DEC5B.6090707@utoronto.ca>

Hi--- I am also setting up a new OS10.9 (Mavericks) machine and 
installed the corresponding build of R 3.1.0 only to discover that the 
Package Manager doesn't work. Without uninstalling anything I then tried 
installing the Snow Leopard version and still get the same error message 
pasted below: "'.find.package' is defunct."

I think this is the problem referred to on list by Brian Ripley: 
"However, the coverage for the Mavericks binary packages on CRAN is 
still not as good as for Snow Leopard, and if you primarily use binary 
packages we recommend the Snow Leopard CRAN binary.  The benefits of the 
Mavericks build come when installing packages from sources."

I'm not very good at complicated installs, so I would be grateful for 
advice how to recover from this and get a functioning copy of the Snow 
Leopard version installed on my machine.

Many thanks, ---TAD.

That is not so: it is a known bug in R.app and so present in both builds 
(unless they have been updated since I last tried).  Update R.app (or 
install an R-patched build) from http://r.research.att.com/.

And how to uninstall and install are in the manual, so we will not write 
out here.  Specifically 
http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-patched/R-admin.html#Installing-R-under-OS-X

Dear R-users,
what is the most easiest way to download old versions of R and it's
packages. I have found some functions, but none of them have worked. How
to use the Archieve for this purpose. I would like to have detailed
instructions for Mac. I would need only some older version e.g. effects
2.2-4. I know the address at http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/old/.

I am experiencing a problem with gfortran 4.8.2 obtained from r.research.att.com (http://r.research.att.com/libs/gfortran-4.8.2-darwin13.tar.bz2).

Compiling a simple program (in fixed format)

Following a discussion in http://trac.macports.org/ticket/41364 I ran the debugger lldb.
With this as result

Compiling the exact same program on a Macbook Air 11-inch with an Intel Core i5 as processor  and the exact same OS X 10.9.3 does not give an internal compiler error at all. The program compiles and runs.

It seems the crash in connected to the Intel Core 2 Duo processor in this case.
gfortran-4.2.3 obtained from CRAN compiles the program without any problems.

Since I maintain packages using Fortran I can?t switch to the Mavericks distribution of R and use gfortran 4.8.2.
Using the Snow Leopard  version of R together with gfortran 4.2.3 from CRAN works perfectly.

Maybe someone can throw some light on this and hopefully the problem can be fixed.

Berend,

yes, your CPU is too old and thus doesn't work with the binary due to lack of support for some newer instructions. I suspect gmp/mpfr may be using some simd instructions that your CPU doesn't support.

Cheers,
Simon

Try adding the other two configure.args "--with-mysql-inc" and "--with-mysql-lib":

$ R CMD INSTALL --configure-args='--with-mysql-dir=/usr/local/mysql-5.6.17-osx10.7-x86_64 --with-mysql-inc=/usr/local/mysql-5.6.17-osx10.7-x86_64/include --with-mysql-lib=/usr/local/mysql-5.6.17-osx10.7-x86_64/lib' RMySQL_0.9-3.tar.gz.tar.gz

or

install.packages("RMySQL", configure.args="--with-mysql-dir=/usr/local//mysql-5.6.17-osx10.7x86_64 --with-mysql-inc=/usr/local/mysql-5.6.17-osx10.7-x86_64/include --with-mysql-lib=/usr/local/mysql-5.6.17-osx10.7-x86_64/lib")

My googling skills are failing. I want to install a package which relies on R. This currently works on windows and linux. When I try it on my macbook I get told

But I have R installed

It seems the installer for the package uses pkg-config to check for the existence of R.

> $ pkg-config --version
> 0.28


It finds e.g. the gnu scientific library

> $ pkg-config  --libs gsl
> -L/usr/local/Cellar/gsl/1.16/lib -lgsl -lgslcblas -lm


But can?t find R

> $ pkg-config  --libs R
> Package R was not found in the pkg-config search path.

On my installation, R lives in

> /Library/Frameworks/R.framework

In order to use pkg-config, it seems I need a .pc file somewhere but I can?t find one.

Can someone either tell me where the .pc file is for R or alternatively how to tell the installer where to find R?

Many thanks

Mac OS X has no pkg-config, so that's why native version of R has no R.pc. It seems that whatever you are compiling doesn't have native OS X support. Since you are already mixing brewed and native code, you may as well just use brew entirely since you've already entered murky waters. I didn't test, but I would presume that it gives you a non-framework installation of R which may provide R.pc.

How to tell the installer to find R is a question you should pose to the authors of whatever you're trying to compile, R has no control over that. Note that the canonical way to obtain R flags is via `R CMD config` so I'd say this is a bug in the package you're compiling - it should be using R CMD config --cppflags and R CMD config --ldflags instead of pkg-config -- it may use pkg-config as a fallback, but is should support R CMD config in the first place.

Finally, you could hand-craft libR.pc which points to the native installation of R - it could look something like

rhome=/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources
rincludedir=/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Headers

Name: libR
Description: R as a library
Version: 3.1.0
Libs: -F/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/.. -framework R -llzma -lz -licucore -lm -liconv
Cflags: -I${rincludedir}
Libs.private:

Untested and, again, the proper way is to use

R CMD config --cppflags
R CMD config --ldflags

Cheers,
Simon

Hi Simon,

Thanks very much for this. Very much appreciated. I will communicate with the package authors but they only support windows and linux at the moment. I was hoping it would be straightforward to get it to work for Mac OS and then send them a patch. From what you say, it shouldn?t be too difficult. I will try next week but I may need a bit more help.

BTW the package is really cool. It allows you to call R from Haskell in an integrated way. I need to be able to perform non linear least squares and there is no existing library in Haskell to do this; enter R :-)

Thanks once again,

Dominic Steinitz

But the current manuals give more details ... footnote 44 says

This is a tarball which needs to be unpacked in the Terminal by e.g. 
sudo tar -zxf gfortran-4.8.2-darwin13.tar.bz2 -C /.

Perfect. Sorry. I too me a while to see that, as I was looking in the
wrong place (for link below: `gsub("r-release", "r-devel",
