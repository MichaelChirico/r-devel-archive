But 'gcc' and 'g++' _are_ included in Xcode 5, as a version of clang 
(rather than a GCC-based compiler).  That is rather confusing.

It does mean that packages with autoconf scripts which do not take care 
to set CC/CXX will run with the clang-based gcc/g++ and quite possibly 
get incorrect results.  (Since autoconf has always preferred gcc to cc.)

Going to the preferences screen in R.app (Command + , or

a segfault. If I click any the tabs at the top of the preferences
window R doesn't crash, but if I go back to the  "show all" tab and

I can confirm this, but only when selecting the icons in the 
"Show All" section. Selecting the top ones, it works.

Internal relocation operation at ATT, coinciding unfortunately with Simon's traveling. Servers have been moving to different networks with associated DNS and other issues. It should fall into place eventually. (Don't forget that it is barely Tuesday morning in the US now.)

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Automatically detecting and setting CXX compiler using
	configure/Makevars
Message-ID: <906DDF8A-B956-4515-8A97-DFC170B24647@gmail.com>

Hi all, 

I'm developing a package that needs to be compiled on installation but am unsure how to ensure that the proper C++ compiler is invoked when installing this package from source. Is there anyway to, at build time, auto-detect and set the available compiler using configure / Makevars? 

More specifically, I'm using the CRAN-provided  binary of R 3.02 running on Mac OS 10.8.5 with XCode 5 installed. By default, the Makeconf included with the R installation ($RHOME/Resources/Makeconf) has CXX set as:

CXX = llvm-g++-4.2 -arch x86_64

However, as llvm-g++-4.2 is no longer distributed with XCode5, package installation fails when I attempt to install from source with an expected "llvm-g++-4.2: command not found" message. 

I see that one solution is to manually set CXX in the ~/.R/Makevars file. However,  I'm wondering if it's possible to have the combination of a configure script / Makevars.in automatically detect and set the CXX variable upon installation. 

As I have it specified currently, my configure.ac script use the AC_PROG_CXX macro to detect and set CXX. 
https://github.com/nolanlab/Rclusterpp/blob/dev/configure.ac

Then, in my Makevars.in, I attempt to specify the value of CXX detected by the configure script
https://github.com/nolanlab/Rclusterpp/blob/dev/src/Makevars.in

I can then run the configure script manually and, in the produced Makevars file, it appears to detect and set CXX to the proper complier, i.e.:

CXX=g++ -arch x86_64

However, when I then try and install the package, it seems to default back to the using llvm-g++-4.2 as the compiler and thus, installation fails. 

I of course could be approaching this in completely the wrong way. Any suggestions on how I might be able to auto-detect and set the appropriate compiler at build time? 

-Rob

This is documented in the current manuals: please read them.  I posted 
how to get the compilers used for the CRAN binary, on this list when 
Xcode 5 was released (it is for Mountain Lion only):

https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-mac/2013-September/010327.html

However, the compiler supplied by XCode5 (Apple LLVM 5.0) is different from the one specified in the R 3.0.2 binary Makeconf file (llvm-g++4.2) and hence, despite having an installed compiler, they cannot build packages because R attempts to use llvm-g++4.2 (which does not exist, even with the XCode command line tools installed). I don't know if this is a big problem but I suspect that any Mac OS X user who now starts with a fresh install binary install of R and XCode5 command line tools will not be able to build and install C/C++ packages from source without first modifying the Makeconf file (or ~/.R/Makeconf) to point to the new compiler supplied by XCode5.

However, I don't think I appreciated the problems with compiling a package with a compiler different from that which was used to build the R binary  - thank you for that info. Does that mean that the only good option is to submit the package to CRAN so it can be compiled into a binary with the same compiler that's used to build the Mac OS X R binary distribution?

That is the 'Right' way to go and it is what will happen per default if you are using Makevars to compile you package.  If you need to use configure, there are hints in R-exts and we can help more specifically, preferably you have a package somewhere.  This way you do not run into (weird) problems which can arise when you use different compilers for R and your package.

For most users, if you distribute your package via CRAN / Bioconductor they will have the option of receiving a binary version of the package and therefore do not need a C++ compiler.  In addition, even if you want them to install from source, using a configure script will (most likely) not really help at all - if they don't have the Xcode supplied compiler, they are extremely unlikely to have any other compiler installed on their system.  And really, if a user is using the CRAN binary of R and wants to install a package from source, it is really their responsibility to setup their system to do so. In summary, I don't think you will help anyone with a configure step trying to locate an alternative compiler.

Thanks Prof. Ripley. 

I did see your post about installing XCode 4.6 & 5 but incorrectly assumed that it would be better to compile and build packages with the latest version of XCode 5 (September 2013) rather than install the old compilers. Hence the interest in auto-detecting and specifying the currently installed compiler during package build time. However, I did not realize the potential problems that could occur if R and package binaries were built using different compilers - thank you Kasper for alerting me :)

I also did see this portion in the R-admin manual:
http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-patched/R-admin.html#OS-X-packages

I think I just expected that if you could set the value of CXX in ~/.R/Makevars, that you would also be able to set the value of CXX in the package-specific Makevars (src/Makevars) file as well. I have not be able to do this successfully but I suppose this is probably by design.

Cheers, 

-Rob

However, the compiler supplied by XCode5 (Apple LLVM 5.0) is different from the one specified in the R 3.0.2 binary Makeconf file (llvm-g++4.2) and hence, despite having an installed compiler, they cannot build packages because R attempts to use llvm-g++4.2 (which does not exist, even with the XCode command line tools installed). I don't know if this is a big problem but I suspect that any Mac OS X user who now starts with a fresh install binary install of R and XCode5 command line tools will not be able to build and install C/C++ packages from source without first modifying the Makeconf file (or ~/.R/Makeconf) to point to the new compiler supplied by XCode5.

Does that mean that the only good option is to submit the package to CRAN so it can be compiled into a binary with the same compiler that's used to build the Mac OS X R binary distribution?

That is the 'Right' way to go and it is what will happen per default if you are using Makevars to compile you package.  If you need to use configure, there are hints in R-exts and we can help more specifically, preferably you have a package somewhere.  This way you do not run into (weird) problems which can arise when you use different compilers for R and your package.

For most users, if you distribute your package via CRAN / Bioconductor they will have the option of receiving a binary version of the package and therefore do not need a C++ compiler.  In addition, even if you want them to install from source, using a configure script will (most likely) not really help at all - if they don't have the Xcode supplied compiler, they are extremely unlikely to have any other compiler installed on their system.  And really, if a user is using the CRAN binary of R and wants to install a package from source, it is really their responsibility to setup their system to do so.

Is there a way to set the font size in the lower bar on the R.app console? I find it super-handy to see the function parameter list, but (especially with fns with lots of parameters) the font shrinks too small for me to read comfortably...

Best, tim

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Erroneous zeros in results using Matrix package
Message-ID: <57530ED5-991C-4C56-80D6-C4E82DCE8B09@smu.edu>

I've come across some interesting behavior using the Matrix package, and I cannot seem to explain it.  I have sent this issue to the Matrix maintainers, and Martin Maechler was unable to replicate it on his Linux system.  Since it might be something Mac-specific, he suggested that I post here.  The complete code is pasted at the bottom of this email, along with my sessionInfo() output.

The function f takes 3 parameters:  p, k and N.  First, it creates A,  a lower triangle of a sparse block diagonal matrix with p blocks, and each block being k x k.  I then let S = AA', and have L be the lower Cholesky decomposition of L. (I use Cholesky instead of chol because, for my "real" application, because I need the permutation matrix also).  I then multiply L by a matrix z, where each column in z is a standard MVN sample.

None of the elements should be zero.  However, if z becomes very large, I get lots of zero entries.

Additionally, you will see that when I try to coerce a large identity matrix to a dtCMatrix, some of the ones are lost. 

A word of warning:  this script does consume a lot of RAM, and it will take several minutes to run.  But it would be helpful if someone with a Mac Pro with 32GB of RAM could try to replicate the problem.

Thanks in advance for your help.

Michael

I suppose that is true.  But the problem does not occur in smaller examples.  It only occurs when working with very large matrices.  That's the whole point.  And to be fair, I did warn the members of the list that this is a memory-intensive example.

Isn't this related to the mysterious issue with 32-bit overflow in matrices on some OS X systems? Unfortunately I can't seem to find that thread - I recall Brian committing a work-around, so can you test more recent R? In addition, which BLAS implementation are you using?

Thanks,
Simon

That was my guess, and the workaround is in 3.0.2 so please try current 
R (as the posting guide asked to be done before posting).

I was unaware of the 32-bit overflow issue, and I must have missed the announcement of R-3.0.2.  I cannot update from 3.0.1 to 3.0.2 right away, for some unrelated reasons, but I will do that ASAP.  I did peruse the NEWS file for R-3.0.2, R-3.0.2-patched, and R-devel, but I did not see any items that immediately jumped out as being connected.

My installation of R links to the Intel MKL BLAS, version 11.0, Update 3.  I compiled R using clang, with flags -msse4.2 -mtune=corei7 -O2 (among some others).  I would doubt that the BLAS choice is the problem, since a simple coercion of a large identity matrix to its sparse counterpart should not have to call a BLAS routine.  I can send my Makeconf file if you think that would be useful.

I just installed R-3.0.2, and the problem remains, with the exact same results.  And I did hear back from another user off-list, who also gets the same erroneous output.

I am using OSX 10.6.8, TexShop 2.47, and TeXLive-2013.  When I try to compile my .tex file I get an error at every \begin{Soutput}:

l.100 \begin{Soutput}
                     
? 
[1]

! LaTeX Error: Undefined color `darkred'.

I can not figure out where Latex is thinking there is a darkred colour associated with the following code.

Here is the .tex code at lines 99 through 117:

\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Soutput}
% latex table generated in R 3.0.2 by xtable 1.7-1 package
% Sun Oct 20 10:09:50 2013
\begin{table}[ht]

  \hline

  \hline
1 & -1 & 1 & 868.78 & 97695.69 & 312.56 \\ 
  2 & -1 & 3 & 652.90 & 51953.43 & 227.93 \\ 
  3 & 1 & 1 & 1061.43 & 181553.65 & 426.09 \\

   \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\end{Soutput}
\end{Schunk}

I have double checked that the sweave.sh, sweave.engine, and sweavenoclean.engine files have permissions of read and execute.  The files are in the correct directory.

I have run out of ideas to check.


Thanks,

Presumably you have an unusual definition for the Soutput macro.  The 
standard one doesn't set the colour, but there are various redefinitions 
or modifications (through the fancyvrb LaTeX package) that do.

There are two strategies for finding this sort of thing:


1.  Shorten your file until the problem goes away, then back off one 
step:  that's the step that's causing the problem.

2.  Search for the string "darkred" in every file on your disk, and see 
which ones might be relevant.

I have Xcode 5.0 and the CLI installed.

Any advice on what do I need to do to make f951 available?

Also, installing r-devel has the result that after switching back to R-3.0.2 patched, 
it crashes upon starting.  The issue seems to be with the GUI, as there seems to
be no problem from the command line.  I will forward details if that seems useful.

You have your compilers set up incorrectly.

llvm-gcc-4.2 is not part of Xcode 5.  Did you perchance update to Xcode 
5: that removes some things?

Install the supported gfortran (which is 4.2.3 not 4.2.1): see the 
R-admin manual.

The R.app front-end (which you most likely mean by 'it' but did not say) 
is tied to a particular version of R, and this is documented in the 
R-admin manual.  You most likely need to re-install the earlier version.

Thanks.  I did indeed update to Xcode 5.0.  So do I perhaps need to go back
to an earlier version of Xcode?  Installing the April 16 Mountain Lion command 
line tools for Xcode, as suggested by Robert Bruggner, still gives the error
message.

I installed 
  gfortran-4.2.3.dmg (ca. 27MB, GNU Fortran 4.2.3 release)
from http://r.research.att.com/tools/

Consistently with this, I find:

<<<
jhm-air:dm johnm1$ gfortran --version
GNU Fortran (GCC) 4.2.3
jhm-air:dm johnm1$ which gfortran
/usr/local/bin/gfortran
>>>

I do not then understand the reference to 4.2.1.  

[I did note however Simon's message of April 13 2013, albeit with respect to the Apple gcc branch 
  for version 4.2.4? 

  <<<
  This is what the Apple gcc branch reports, because that's what the gcc driver is build from (Apple's gcc 4.2.1 build 5666.3), but the Fortran sources that have been added into that branch are from GNU Fortran     4.2.4 (see the page that you downloaded it from - it has the details).

(That is not needed if you updated, and does not contain a Fortran 
compiler.)

The R-admin manual says

gfortran from http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools/gfortran-4.2.3.pkg

which is not the same thing.

And note the compiler is invoked as gfortran-4.2, not gfortran, which 
may or may not be the same thing.

We really can't read the manuals for you.  If you use a binary build of 
R (on any platform), you have to use exactly the specified toolset.

The information on CRAN points in what are currently misleading directions then.
If I go to bin/macosx, I am referred in several places to the R for Mac OS X FAQ
and to http://r.research.att.com/.  On http://r.research.att.com/ it says
  "In order to compile R and R packages you will need Xcode Developer Tools version 3.1 
  or higher and a universal Fortran compiler. For details and download, please read the 
  Tools page. The R 3.0.0 and higerh binaries are built using Xcode 4.2."

I followed that instruction and installed the compiler that was noted there.  I did not see
any reference there to the R-admin manual.  Sure, there is a warning that some links
may be broken.

one of my students just download mac mavericks.
starting with the new system, R-3.0.1 in the APP is misbehaving.

enter
TRUE <- FALSE
(to illustrate why use of T is not a good practice)

R app gives the error message
invalid (do_set) left-hand side to assignment

*** caught segfault ***
address 0x7c0, cause 'memory not mapped'
Possible actions
1 2 3 4


The R program run in the terminal behaves correctly.
it reports the invalid assignment and then gives a normal R prompt.

Will this happen in R-3.0.2? (yes we will download and check that).

Rich,

I get the same error message, but not the segfault, using 3.0.2 on Mavericks, using R.app:

R version 3.0.2 (2013-09-25) -- "Frisbee Sailing"
Copyright (C) 2013 The R Foundation for Statistical Computing
Platform: x86_64-apple-darwin10.8.0 (64-bit)

...

[R.app GUI 1.62 (6558) x86_64-apple-darwin10.8.0]

which I otherwise never use.

On Mountain Lion, R 3.0.2:

TRUE = FALSE
Error in TRUE = FALSE : invalid (do_set) left-hand side to assignment

in R.app, and in a terminal.  I also get the same on a linux machine.

I think that's a  feature, not a bug.

The error is expected; it's the (occasional) ensuing segfault which is worrisome.

of course you never use it.  it won't work.
the point of the email is that writing an invalid statement should
trigger only an error message.  It should not trigger the segfault.

It looks like the segfault is specific to 3.0.1 since your and Marc both report
that you don't see the segfault on 3.0.2

I will tell the student to upgrade to 3.0.2 immediately.

To clarify, I think the issue is that R.app from 3.0.1 crashes on this 
error (and maybe any error) on Mavericks for the temple.edu student.

We need to see if 3.0.2 does so too, but I see no change in the code

Rich, 

Just for clarification, I was referring to never using R.app, since I use ESS. 

Of course, I don't use the assignment statement either... :-)

Regards,

Marc

I can confirm that R.app from 3.0.1 crashes on any error on Mavericks, and 3.0.2 doesn?t (for me, running on an iMac ~ 2010)

From comments made on the thread regarding the segfault in the R.app GUI following the error from TRUE <- FALSE, I'm inferring that at least three people ( Prof. Ripley, S. Urbanek, and T. Bates) have installed R 3.0.2 on Mavericks.  I have R version 3.0.2 (2013-09-25) -- "Frisbee Sailing" with R.app GUI 1.60 (6475) and XCode Version 3.2.6 in OSX 10.7.5 and have installed the Command Line Tools, so at the moment I'm  generally succeeding when compiling from source. (I see I am rather behind the current GUI version although that was not my intention when I updated to 3.0.2.)  Are there any specific steps one needs to take (or avoid taking) in order to preserve access to (or gain updated access to) tools for compiling packages from source?

(I've seen people posting problems on SO where the error after updating to Mavericks was a missing copy of llvm-gcc-4.2.)

With XCode 5.0, clang is now the default compiler toolchain supplied,
and llvm-gcc-4.2 is no longer available.

FWIW, I and many others have had a lot of success compiling packages
with the version of clang supplied with XCode. The only requirement
(at this point) is that you set your own ~/.R/Makevars settings, as
discussed in the SO posts -- in particular, you need

    CC=clang
    CXX=clang++

You may need to reinstall packages from source that your packages link
to (e.g., Rcpp) and compile them with the new set of compilers for
them to play nicely together, but in general this should work.
However, hopefully others can give advice on the 'recommended'
compiler toolchain now for R and Mavericks.

The recommended toolchain as far as CRAN binaries are concerned remains the same since the binaries did not change. I cannot currently check on my 10.9 machine so I'll have to confirm it later, but there are several options - you can install Apple's original llvm-gcc package or use our gcc build (which includes gfortran). Depending on the route you take, you can also simply symlink the compiler to lvm-g*-4.2 instead of modifying Makevars.

If you want to start from scratch (i.e. compile R and packages from sources), then you can use clang, it's known to work (modulo a few packages that are not up to date).

Cheers,
Simon

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Problems installing igraph
Message-ID: <A4334E92-658C-450F-A5FB-F4B09261E7EA@raingods.net>

I have an OS X 10.8.4 system, with R (3.0.2) installed and managed by macports. When I try to install the igraph package in R, I'm getting an error finding _colamd_printf

I haven't found anything on this in google, so I'm not really sure where to go trying to track this problem down.

Michael,

we don't support macports so I cannot provide more than a general advice.

First, your output appears to deal with a dirty package - I don't see any compilation output and yet you have a dylib - that doesn't seem right. Make sure you're building from a clean tar ball (and *not* a directory!) - you have cut out the important part so we can't tell.

If you are sure that you're building off a clean tar ball then my guess would be that there is some problem with the linking flags used in igraph. R build process doesn't perform link-time symbol resolution, so errors in flags are not apparent at link time - they only show up at run-time. Typically, to trace issues like this, you'll search you libraries for the missing symbol and add that library to the link flags. nm is your friend when checking the symbols.

Cheers,
Simon

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac]  R crashes on preferences screen
Message-ID: <9081591E-2F0E-486B-AD02-6123A516D437@emergencydoc.ca>

Happens to me every time, in R 2.x.x as well. The crash happens if I click the icons below the "Show All" pane, but not if I click on the individual tabs at the top of the preference window.

 *** caught segfault ***
address 0x1006e9000, cause 'memory not mapped'

Possible actions:
1: abort (with core dump, if enabled)
2: normal R exit
3: exit R without saving workspace
4: exit R saving workspace

Sorry of sending this again.
I forgot to say that I am using R 3.0.2 on OSX 10.9

I tried several packages including MASS, mvtnorm,...
However, this should be related to https://bugs.launchpad.net/raspbian/+bug/1007014
PS: I have edited /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.0/Resources/etc/Makeconf for CC and fortran compilers.

We are required by our CERT team to update: they view this as a service 
pack and hence compulsory for machines connected (directly, not via NAT) 
to ox.ac.uk.

Please note that everything here is about upgrading to 10.9: things 
could be different for a fresh install (we have not yet done one).

Yes, but for 10.8 it will still be there if you updated Xcode, and you 
can also still install the command-line tools for 4.6.3 (as I posted 
earlier).

If you upgrade to Mavericks (10.9) the llvm-* compilers will still be 
present but some of the dylibs they link to are not.

Please don't quote 'SO posts' (and especially not without links).  The 
definitive information is in the R manuals (and has been since R 3.0.0). 
  See 
http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-admin.html#OS-X-packages 
.  Apart from anything else, the people who update the manuals deserve 
credit for their work.

Actually, you don't.  clang and llvm-gcc-4.2 are ABI compatible for 
10.8.  And I have successfully tested RcppEigen (which has just been 
updated) on 10.9 with clang using the CRAN binary distribution of Rcpp.

remains the same since the binaries did not change. I cannot currently
check on my 10.9 machine so I'll have to confirm it later, but there are
several options - you can install Apple's original llvm-gcc package or
use our gcc build (which includes gfortran). Depending on the route you
take, you can also simply symlink the compiler to lvm-g*-4.2 instead of
modifying Makevars.

The Makevars route works fine.

> If you want to start from scratch (i.e. compile R and packages from

packages that are not up to date).

A gotcha we have seen so far:

/usr/X11 exists but is no longer a link to /opt/X11 for XQuartz.  So I 
needed --x-includes=/opt/X11/include --x-libraries=/opt/X11/lib on the 
configure line.

First, no need to cross-post to three groups. I am replying to R-SIG-Mac only here.

iODBC is still available on OSX. Apple removed the ODBC Administrator application back on Snow Leopard. A newer ODBC Manager application is freely available for download here:

  http://www.odbcmanager.net/index.php
 
It is supported by Actual Technologies, which offers for purchase, ODBC drivers on OSX for various data sources. I use their driver for Oracle.

If you want to use the older Apple ODBC Administrator application, it is still available here:

  http://support.apple.com/kb/DL895

If you want to stay with unixODBC, you may want to read through the vignette for RODBC that Prof. Ripley has written and pay attention to the Installation section on page 22:

  http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RODBC/vignettes/RODBC.pdf

which has some hints that should be helpful, such as using:

  --with-odbc-manager=odbc 

when installing RODBC from source. Yes, RODBC will, by default, use iODBC on OSX, since that is the default ODBC installation on OSX. Thus, the precompiled binary for RODBC will not work for what you are attempting to do.

Marc Schwartz

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] C++ and Mavericks
Message-ID: <526CBB6F.7040403@stats.ox.ac.uk>

It was not clear from any of the documentation that Xcode 5.0.1 for 10.8 
and for 10.9 use (by default) essentially separate C++ toolchains.

Both are based on clang++ "3.3svn" which is Apple parlance for 'some 
version less than 3.3 and lacking some 3.2 features'.  But they have 
different headers and C++ libraries.

- 10.8 is using those from g++ 4.2.1
- 10.9 is using those from libcxx.

This means that they are not completely ABI-compatible, and any package 
with C++ linkage (e.g. packages rgdal and rzmq) may need the external 
software recompiled. [NB: clang++ vs g++ were ABI compatible in 10.8. 
And 'may' not 'will'.]

10.9 contains a back-compatibility libstdc++, and most binary packages 
using C++ still work.  However, at least for me JAGS (and hence packages 
rjags and runjags) and BioC package mzR segfault.  I successfully 
re-compiled JAGS and rjags from their sources, but mzR will not compile.

There are about 35 C++-based CRAN packages which do not compile using 
clang++ plus libcxx.  The usual issues: g++ headers include other 
headers not required by the standards which other implementations do 
not, g++ uses 'tr1' for headers where libcxx does not, and more 
comprehensive implementations result in ambiguous matches.

Hi,

take a look in your Ressources/etc/Makeconf and your /.Renviron file and search for cairo. There is possibly a ?stale? path such that R is searching for a path that existed in ML but not in Mavericks. Check the path via locate in your shell. 

Maybe it helps then, if you install the new Xcode developer tools for Mavericks via Xcode -> Xcode Developer Tools -> More Xcode Developer Tools.

Just a guess

Best
Simon

Jon,

first install the Xcode developer tools for Mavericks via Xcode developer tools -> Other developer tools (if you don?t have yet).

Then in your configure command add CPPFLAGS=?-D__ACCELERATE__? as suggested by Simon Urbanek on http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.r.mac/7293. That should make it run.


Best 

Simon

P.S.: I would consider the gcc4.8.2 binary from http://hpc.sourceforge.net for Mavericks and ML; I worked before with the macports alternative and found it easier to use these binaries. They are always up to date?

Just for the record, I install the gcc binaries from http://hpc.sourceforge.net (no MacPorts anymore)  and with these I compile R from sources. Before I used the gcc4.8 from Macports - but never used R from MacPorts. 

And yes, with Apple installation of any open-source software including a compilation via configure/make becomes complicated and it will always be.

Please note that http://r.research.att.com/tools/ explicitly warns about using the Fortran compiler from http://hpc.sourceforge.net, in case you need Fortran for building a package from source.  Unfortunately the Fortran compiler especially supplied for R use is ancient and will not properly compile stuff that depends on a more modern Fortran compiler version (such as Julia).

Thanks for the replies.

Adding "-D__ACCELERATE__" to CPPFLAGS does seem to work. I did see that thread before, but I was under the impression that it was an issue with configuring against the vecLib framework rather than Accelerate. It seems pretty surprising to me that not defining this variable would lead to a type conversion error. Hey-ho.

In any case, there seems to be no issue with my toolchain: self-built gcc/g++/gfortran works just fine with this tweak.

Regards,
Jon

Unfortunately the Fortran compiler especially supplied for R use is ancient and will not properly compile stuff that depends on a more modern Fortran compiler version (such as Julia).

I'm not sure I understand (apologies, I'm not really a mac user). We
are using these devices in non-interactive R sessions (RApache,
RScript). So the Cairo devices can only be used on machines that have
xquartz is installed? IIRC, we had some mac server at some point that
did not have xquartz but was still capable of generating cairo based
svg and png. The r-admin manual says "cairo support (without Pango)
has been added to the binary distribution".

Well part of the problem is that even running capabilities() to see if
Cairo is available at all makes R exit. Is this really expected
behavior?

Yes, if you are using the CRAN binary distribution of R which was built 
against Apple X11.

In the Mac GUI, my understanding is that you are expected to be editing in a draft document. If you highlight code within the draft, and jointly press <cmd>-<return> you get the block execution. New drafts are created with either the file menu or the "blank-document" icon at the top of the GUI.

The draft document will serve the same purpose.

The up-arrow key only recovers the history (lines/chunks) when the focus is the console, not from within an active document window.

If you entered it as a chunk, it will be recovered from the history buffer as a chunk. (You can bring up the R for Mac OS X FAQ from the Help menu.)

You can move to a line (in the editing window) and even without selecting it use cmd-return to run the whole line. (I believe that is what the grey-highlighting is trying to tell you.)

The <Shift>-arrow key combination works in both the editor and the console as it has always worked on a Mac to extend selection.  I doubt that behavior is documented in the FAQ, but it may give you some of the behavior you seek.

I think you will find the <option>-drag behavior to be Mac specific. I was very happy when it's availability was returned to the Mac GUI repertoire.

Hi,

It looks like the xlsx package requires Java and you will need to re-install Java after the Mavericks update. Java is not included as part of the upgrade process.

You can download the Apple variant of Java for Mavericks here:

Is this happening when you are running R from w/in R.app (which, I
think, is not new), or are you running R from the terminal and still
seeing this)?

Same system, no error (on the shell). Debugging parallel processes is in general not easy - here is a thread on this using lldb: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14746315/how-to-attach-to-child-process-in-lldb. But first hope for an answer of a more experienced list user, who possibly knows how the processes are actually forked.

Are you sure, that you call just these commands? Or did you use these for a simple example? Usually the error comes up from the Core Foundation library, if a child process tries to fork unsafely.

Regarding the your problems with X11 though the answer from Steve sounds like a very good guess.

It happens when a forked child process tries to use some "fork unsafe"
opratation, after the parent has already done so as well, see [1]. It
is related to R.app in the sense that the GUI uses the CF event
loop which is considered fork unsafe, and therefore a forked child
process can't do any fork unsafe operations anymore. However it also
happens in other contexts such as prefork in RApache [2].

But my actual question is: what is it about using httr::GET that is
considered fork "unsafe", which was not considered unsafe in 10.8?

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Updating to Mavericks
Message-ID: <527119C8.3060700@stats.ox.ac.uk>

This is an attempt to collect together various pieces of advice.

If you update to Mavericks and want to compile packages (or run some) 
with the CRAN binary R, you will need to

- Update R to 3.0.2 or later if you use R.app.

- Re-install XQuartz.  The Mavericks update re-populates /usr/X11 with 
links which tell you to install XQuartz (even if it is currently installed).

- Re-install the Apple Java 6 runtime if you use rJava.  Try any of the 
rJava examples and you will be prompted for an install.

- Install Xcode 5.0.1 if you had not previously done so.

- Re-install the Xcode command-line tools.  Xcode for Mavericks has 
moved most things inside Xcode (specifically under 
/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer) and the command-line tools 
previously installed seemed almost to work, but not entirely.

xcode-select --install

seems to be the recommended way to do so under Mavericks.


If you previously had them installed, the Xcode 4.6.3 compilers (such as 
llvm-g++-4.2) should still work.  Otherwise you could select clang as 
your compiler: see 
http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-admin.html#OS-X-packages 
. There are also compilers called 'gcc' and 'g++' in Xcode 5.0.1: these 
are clang-based but are not quite the same as clang/clang++.  Although 
g++ reports

% g++ --version
Configured with: --prefix=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr 
--with-gxx-include-dir=/usr/include/c++/4.2.1

it looks at the libcxx headers at
/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/../lib/c++/v1/ 
.  And the packages which do not compile under clang++ do not compile 
under g++ .

Packages using a C++ interface may need re-compiling if you use clang++ 
(or g++) as your C++ compiler.  The external software at 
http://r.research.att.com/libs/ which I know does is gdal and zeromq. It 
would be prudent to compile Rcpp with the same compiler as a Rcpp-using 
package, although not always necessary.

Hi All,

I wanted to follow up on this thread, as the information that I provided above was not complete, as I now know from conversations with Prof. Ripley, information found online by searching in the Apple Developer Forums and an e-mail exchange with Actual Technologies' (AT) tech support.

Beginning with OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard), Apple removed the ODBC Administrator GUI application from the default OS installation, as I noted above. The Apple version was and is still available as a separate download from Apple.com and the AT folks began to support and release and updated version called ODBC Manager, as I also noted.

However, that was only part of the story as it turns out.

Beginning with OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion), Apple began the process of deprecating direct support for iODBC. The header files for iODBC that were included with XCode on 10.8 in the SDK tree apparently had indications of this, but it was not overtly documented anywhere else, including the XCode release notes. The binary dylib files for iODBC were still present in /usr/lib on 10.8, so if you wanted to use, for example, the RODBC binary for OS X on 10.8, there was not an issue. You still need the ODBC Administrator/Manager GUI to set up the DSN configuration of course, unless you manually set up the configuration files.

There is not a specific indication as to why, but an entry from August of *2012* in the Apple Dev Forums by an Apple rep indicated that a decision had been made by Apple to engage in the deprecation of the default installation of iODBC on OS X. This reply was to another user who had noted the header file content indicating this and posted a query. The Apple rep suggested that users begin to consider going to iODBC.org for OS X binaries where available or the source code moving forward. Alternatively, users should consider moving to other ODBC tools such as unixODBC or the use of native (non-ODBC) drivers for the data sources of interest.

With 10.9 (Mavericks), Apple has now completely removed iODBC from the default OS X installation. In the latest version of XCode, the binary dylib files for iODBC are present in the SDK tree for 10.9, but the header files have been removed, causing problems for folks who need to build iODBC dependent applications from source. There are indications however, that at some point in the future, even the iODBC dylib binary files will be removed from the XCode distribution. Near term at least, one could feasibly copy/move the dylib files from the SDK tree in 10.9 to /usr/lib, or simply symlink to them, but of course it means installing XCode just for that purpose, if you have no other need for it.

After I upgraded from 10.8 to 10.9 last week, I had no issues in using the RODBC binary with the AT driver to access our Oracle server. Thus, I had no initial basis to think that there was anything wrong on 10.9. 

However, what I was not aware of at the time and now am, is that AT recently updated their ODBC driver installation package to include the iODBC binaries, specifically because of Apple's prior iODBC deprecation decision. If they are not present on the system to which the AT drivers are being installed (eg. 10.9), the iODBC binaries in the AT installation package will be installed in /usr/lib to enable the AT drivers to function. This is important for AT, since their drivers are compiled to use iODBC and not unixODBC. I had coincidentally updated the AT driver installation on my MacBook Pro after updating to 10.9 last week, which biased my perspective of iODBC support on 10.9.

Thus, as Mikkel noted in the original post, folks need to be aware that iODBC has been completely removed from OS X 10.9.

As the Apple rep noted in his response on the Dev Forums, options include going to iODBC.org directly if you wish to continue to use iODBC with ODBC drivers on OS X. If you elect to purchase and use the AT ODBC drivers, as I have done for Oracle, the iODBC binaries will now be installed on your system if not otherwise present. The AT installation packages also include the ODBC Manager GUI.

Alternatives would, of course, be to shift to unixODBC as Mikkel has done, being careful that whatever ODBC drivers you elect to use are compatible. If you elect to go down this path, as I noted above in my initial reply, you would need to compile the RODBC package from source, since it is compiled for OS X against the iODBC libs by default.

Thanks to Prof. Ripley for his communications and to the AT support folks for their clarifications on the current situation and their community support.

Regards,

Marc Schwartz

I didn't have time to look (will do later today), but a wild guess is that Apple was moving away from some common libraries like OpenSSL and replacing them with their own which could be CF-based and thus unsafe. Again, that's wild guess, I'll have to look at the trace to confirm that.

Cheers,
Simon

Message-ID: <F15F649F-A33C-4907-89AD-3EC1DD471A41@noaa.gov>

Hi,

Since upgrading to Mavericks, all X11 windows created by R are without title bar (no maximize/minimize/close buttons, no title)...just a blank white canvas placed in the upper-left corner of my primary display.  R draws into this just fine, but I can't move, close, or otherwise manipulate the window.  This occurs with X11() called from remote machines (an older R-2.14.1), and from R-3.0.0 and R-3.0.2 locally.  Other X applications, both locally- and remotely-executed, do not suffer from this issue.  I also upgraded Xquartz to the 2.7.5-rc3 recommended for Mavericks users by the Xquartz team, but it had no effect on this issue.  I don't know if this is an R issue or an Xquartz issue...any ideas?

Thanks,

Andy

Thanks. It's unfortunate though, these developments are limiting the
usefulness of the parallel package on the mac, because a lot of basic
functionality is now considered "unsafe" to use in a forked process,
even though on Linux there is no problem at all. I also don't get why
osx decides to kill both the parent and child process when the child
attempt to do something unsafe. That doesn't seem the most graceful
way of dealing with things.

Hi,

I am running 3.0.2 on Mavericks (CRAN binary install) and when I use X11() running R in a terminal session, I get a full window with title bar on my MacBook Pro. I re-installed XQuartz (2.7.4) after upgrading from 10.8 to 10.9.

See the attached screen capture PNG.

I tested it via R.app as well, with the same result.

Regards,

Marc Schwartz

Still,

I do not get any error with package parallel in my Mavericks. I compiled though R with a gcc 4.8.2.

For me the same ? 

Have you installed the Command Line Tools for Mavericks? The Tcl framework location has changed and following http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/RMacOSX-FAQ.html the X11 implementation of Tcl/Tk is used.

Hi Marc, all:

More digging on the Xquartz mailing lists led me to discover the source of this issue.  It's a preferences setting in Mission Control:  "displays have separate spaces".  If that is clicked "on", then a range of X apps will exhibit the behavior that the title bar is hidden behind the menu bar.  (You can see the title bar by entering Mission Control with F3).  Once that setting is turned off, the problem goes away.  Changing this setting does require a logout/login cycle.

-Andy

Hmm interesting. Here is a clip of what happens on my machine:
http://youtu.be/GAtKa6P75Qs. Note that it shows the error messages
from the child proc, but afterwards the parent process is also broken.
I think it is no longer allowed to use fork() or exec().

This mac is an almost completely blank installation of Mavericks. I
formatted and did a recovery of 10.8 before updating to 10.9.
Afterwards installed R.app and xquarts. Other than that almost
everything on the machine is factory settings.

Ah, you're running it in R.app? That less likely to work, because R.app is fully in CF by being an app, so anything that touches the event loop will die. R itself is trying to avoid that by disabling the EL calls in children, but libraries may not know.

Anyway, my hunch was correct - it's libcurl crashing in SSL trying to use CF. There must be some code that is conditional in running in an app, so it thinks it's ok to use CF which fails (see below). A way around could be compiling static libcurl against openssl so it doesn't uses the system one.

Well this was the easiest way to show it; the same problem appears

I wish there was at least way to make situations like these fail more
gracefully... it's fine if the misbehaved child proc is killed, but
it's a bit painful that it also takes down its parent(s). There's
nothing we can do to catch these situations before it is too late?

AFAIR httpuv itself is not fork-safe, so it may be a different issue - in cases like this the exact way the process is setup plays an important role. This appears to be the case for another reason - see below.

I can't think of a way right now, because we have no idea that some 3rd party is calling CF.

BTW: I was trying to cause a fork segfault with something like mcparallel(quartz()), but to my great astonishment it works in 10.9. So apparently it is now safe to call CF after fork() as long as you didn't initialize CF before forking. That's actually great news, because the server (e.g. in my use-case Rserve) just has to make sure that no CF is called and then all is well. Also if the child dies, it does NOT take down the parent - I suspect that there is more involved in your case, so we can take it offline if you want to provide the complete example of your issue.

Cheers,
Simon

Thanks Brian.

One more item: If building from SVN, you may need to run "svn upgrade" in the source directory (at top level).

I suppose that's a consequence of upgrading Xcode rather than Mavericks per se, but might as well mention it here.

Do we have any authoritative advice as to what should go into config.site? Mine seems to work unchanged, but I'm not sure I have a clue about what they are doing anymore.

Yes.  A quick poll of systems I have access to has svn 1.6.x on 10.7, 
1.7.x on 10.8 and 10.9.  As AFAICS it is part of Xcode, it depends on 
the version you had installed and I believe those machines were all 
fully updated.

> Do we have any authoritative advice as to what should go into config.site? Mine seems to work unchanged, but I'm not sure I have a clue about what they are doing anymore.

I have

% cat config.site
CC="clang -mtune=native"
OBJC=$CC
F77="gfortran-4.2 -arch x86_64 -mtune=native"
FC=$F77
CXX="clang++ -mtune=native"
CFLAGS="-g -O2 -Wall -pedantic -Wconversion -Wno-sign-conversion"

Those are rather picky C flags, of course: intended to pick up issues 
with long vectors.

gcc/g++ are not the same as clang/clang++, although the only differences 
I have detected are what they report themselves as.  As I don't know if 
there are any material differences I chose to use clang explicitly. 
Similarly calling gfortran-4.2 explicitly to avoid any other versions 
(and I would even consider using /usr/local/bin/gfortran-4.2).

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Mac OS R/Rcpp/Octave/LLVM/clang/g++ issues
Message-ID: <CADUbQ5hgi3kgzvS6bOnDGwBVv81OFWgJ-RhFVhS3k_s8jrc4tQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

The following strange behavior under Mac OS was distilled from
attempts to resolve problems with the RcppOctave package, but
the problem will be illustrated without use of this package.

Basically, when I try to mix use of the Octave library with
Rcpp, there is a memory exception when the Mac dlopen() is used to
open Rcpp.so (the error occurs in loadLibrary()). To reproduce,
simply drop the two attached files (Makevars and strtest.cpp) into
Rcpp/src. Then 'R CMD INSTALL Rcpp' will fail with a memory problem,
at least sometimes?

I say "sometimes" because this problem did not occur before I
reinstalled Mac OS X 10.8 (because the update to Mavericks
failed). On the other hand, it did occur before the update when I
tried to use an older version of Octave (installed by MacPorts).
 For this test the latest version of Octave (3.6.4) was installed
using homebrew.

Note that the trivial source file strtest.cpp defines one function
that is not actually called! Just instantiating the Octave
class string_vector is enough to trigger the problem. If the
line using string_vector is commented out there is no problem.
It may also not occur if you have older software installed?

After the OS reinstall, and after installing the latest version of the
command line tools, there is no llvm-gcc-4.2 and llvm-g++-4.2
like there was previously?

The problem is clearly related to how templates are instantiated
(or not instantiated) when using clang++ or g++, possibly a version
mismatch, or some Mac OS environmental issue that I have not
been able to isolate. Static initialization may also be a factor.

The last post in this link seems to address a related issue...
https://bugs.launchpad.net/pocl/+bug/1005329

This messy problem raises the question: what is in store
for R under Mac OS X going forward? Apple is dropping support
for gfortran, and even for gcc/g++, so will clang/clang++ be
used? What about Fortran? DragonEgg?

Thanks,
Dominick

I'd snipped the compilation, as it was pretty lengthy and didn't 
contain anything that stood out to me.

I've attached a text file with the output from the compilation, on the 
off chance that something in it helps.

I downloaded R.app from CRAN, and the prebuilt igraph looks like it 
installed without complaint. Looking at that igraph.so with nm, I don't 
see any reference to that function

15:23 steevmi1 at PHUSCA-L24849 
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.0/Resources/library/igraph/libs
% nm ./igraph.so | egrep '_colamd'
000000000003c570 T __glp_colamd
000000000003c0f0 T __glp_colamd_recommended
000000000003c550 T __glp_colamd_report
000000000003c2c0 T __glp_colamd_set_defaults

Google shows some references to this function in SuiteSparse, so I'm 
uninstalling it and will try to install igraph again, and see if maybe 
there was some sort of conflict there, but any other thoughts you might 
have would be greatly appreciated.
