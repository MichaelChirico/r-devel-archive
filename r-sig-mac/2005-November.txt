Tim, thanks for the reports.

That is a work-around for a bug in R 2.2.0 release where the mac- 
binary installation code uses the misspelled function. Unfortunately  
no one noticed it during the alpha/beta phase, so it was only fixed  
in R-patched after the release.

Thanks, that's an encoding issue - fixed now in GUI revision 1956.

That's not really possible (AFAICS), because double-click advances  
into that directory. Without it there would be no way to browse into  
directories in the icon view.

Cheers,
Simon

Source packages are easy to install provided the user has Apple Xcode  
developer tools. Those are shipped with the OS hence easy to install.  
Alternatively you can put the package on CRAN and then we will build  
an OS X binary automatically for you.

Can you tell us, please, more precisely what problems you encounter?  
Usually it's really simple - download the R installer image from CRAN  
( cran.r-project.org or a mirror close to you ), double-click on the  
image, start the installer, install everything and that's it.

Simon

Yes, be a bit more specific. But he wants to install limmagui which  
is a tcl/tk package from BioC, (Of course that still doesn't help  
when we have no idea what works and what doesn't).

Was curious as to why I see some packages with the same
version number in both installed and repository columns?
In general, it seems to be packages installed at the user
level, but don't understand why the distinction exists.
Checksum of some nature?

I'm not quite sure I understand your question - the version numbers  
in "Installed Version" and "Repository Version" are the same iff your  
installed package is up-to-date. They will differ only if the package  
was updated on CRAN since you last installed the package. Clearly, if  
you didn't install the package on your computer yet, there is no  
installed version number. Does that help?

Cheers,
Simon

Obviously I should pay more attention. Had generally
treated it as a package updater when I was feeling
lazy.

One thing that might be nice to add though would be to
color the installed version number of installed packages
that are out-of-date compared to the repository version.

- The 'Update All' pushbutton lacks pop-up help.
- 'Binary Format Packages' checkbox has typo in its pop-up
help ("*.tgz" Extesion).

I cannot reproduce the error. Please send us a reproducible code. If  
you can't reproduce it, then send at least the crash report. Without  
either the report is pretty much useless.

Not sure why help uses word-caps but this is consistent
with what's there now in R.app 1.13 rev 1969.

* The 'Update All' pushbutton lacks pop-up help.

* Nnoticed that the nightly builds seem to be missing
'Contents/Resources/history.icns' as compared to rev 1913
(R-2.2.0). Is this file still used by the current code?

Dear all

after executing the following instructions:

x <- 0:100
y <- x
xyplot(y~x)

if I expand the Quartz graphic window with the GREEN button R.app  
crashes with the following log

?
If I expand the graphic window with the drag triangle everything is OK.

Thanks for your contribution

In case it makes any difference, I get the same problem. The crash  
isn't immediate --- the window expands, the disk churns, and then R  
crashes.

Can you, please, tell us more specifically what GUI (and version) are  
you using? In the R Mac GUI there is no "New Data" menu entry at all,  
so I'm wondering what you are talking about...

Cheers,

Karl, Bill,

thanks for the report. I'm trying to track it down (which it harder  
than it seemes, because it's crashing inside Cocoa while R is idle  
and doing nothing).

Thanks,
Simon

After pondering the matter, I renamed the .RData file to corrupt.RData,
and fired up R.  I then found that

load("corrupt.RData")

worked with no problem at all.

Any ideas on what may be happening here?

I am running 10.4.2

The fatal error is that "Matrix" cannot be loaded, not that the image  
is corrupted. As a part of the restoring process packages are  
attached and that's what fails. Why it fails is another matter ...  
(did you upgrade the version in the meantime or something like that..?)

This is because load doesn't attempt to attach packages - it simply  
restores the data regardless of whether currently attached packages  
can do something with that data... Try loading Matrix before/ 
afterwards...

I experience the same bug as listed below.  One click on the green button successfully increases the graph to full screen, a  second click results in a crash.  Same effect using the yellow (minimize) button.  

This only happens with the lattice library command, not with the regular plot command.  

I have R 2.2.0, on a 500 MHz G3 machine, running OSX 10.4.3.

Dear all

after executing the following instructions:

library(lattice)
x <- 0:100
y <- x
xyplot(y~x)

if I expand the Quartz graphic window with the GREEN button R.app  
crashes with the following log

?
If I expand the graphic window with the drag triangle everything is OK.

Thanks for your contribution

Message-ID: <F6A7E52E-5D6A-45E4-A9AD-0986DBB103F8@gmail.com>

Perhaps I am missing something, such as a preference setting, but I  
have noticed that the Windows binary of R will pause between plots  
when running an example that includes graphics. R.app (and JGR for  
that matter) simply draw the commands without allowing the user to  
interact and see the graphical output before it is covered with  
subsequent commands. You do not have time to see the plots before  
they are covered.  (Try running example("scatterplot") to see what I  
mean.)

Is there a way to allow interaction, or is there a setting so new  
quartz windows are spawned on output?

Thanks,
John

A while back I posted a question about RMySQL not working because of  
a corrupted libmysqlclient.a library.  I know at least one other  
person experienced the same problem.  It was suggested that for  
compatibility with R 2.2.0 I needed to compile MySQL with gcc 3.3  
(not gcc 4.0, as is the case with the MySQL binary).  So:

(i) I installed MySQL from sources using gcc 3.3 as the c and c++  
compiler (this was not as straightforward as I had hoped, and I had  
to experiment with a few different sets of configuration options --  
if anyone is having a problem with this send me an email and I will  
dig up the configure call that worked for me).

(ii) I reinstalled the RMySQL binary using the Package Installer  
feature in R.App.

I am happy to report that it now works (meaning R doesn't crash when  
I issue, say, a dbWriteTable command; it successfully writes the table).

However, even though R no longer crashes, I am still receiving the  
following message when I open the RMySQL package:

"RS-DBI driver warning: (MySQL mismatch between compiled version  
4.0.24 and runtime version 4.1.14)"

The message is still confusing to me because I installed MySQL 5.0.15.

Does anyone have a view on whether this warning will go away if I  
also install RMySQL and DBI from sources?

There is an extended version of John Tull's question that initially 
looks harder:  "How to do the same thing with lattice (or grid) graphics?"

par(ask=TRUE)

doesn't have any effect on example(xyplot), for instance.  (And since 
lattice uses grid graphics, there's no reason it should.)

The answer in this case is to use the call:

grid.prompt(TRUE)

and one further complication is that grid.prompt() is not visible to the 
user if you just require(lattice), presumably because the lattice 
namespace doesn't export this function.  To get the functionality, you 
need to explicitly do:

require(grid)

after which the grid.prompt() works fine and has the desired result.

(I suspect this is not really a Mac OS X question, but haven't tried it 
on Linux, e.g.)

Answered my own question:  Installing RMySQL from source did make the  
warning go away and restored all functionality (although dbWriteTable  
worked in my last message, dbReadTable still crashed R).  The Package  
Installer menu item was all I used for the Source install (viewing  
CRAN "source" packages, then Install).  It was not necessary to  
install DBI from source.

Message-ID: <7BAD1FE1-6B3D-4863-8113-53F44E2D2B83@stat.berkeley.edu>

I noticed today that the R binaries from CRAN have a new directory  
for each new release, such that we have
   /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.2
with
   /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources
being a symlink to
   /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Version/Current

For obvious reasons (saving one's old installation) this is a good idea.

But what about adopting a similar setup for
   $HOME/Library/R/library
so we get
   $HOME/Library/R/Versions/2.2
etc.

In that way, a given user's setup is again saved across R versions.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] tcl/tk
Message-ID: <43844BD6.7010006@fz-rossendorf.de>

hi everybody,

I upgraded to 2.2.0 today. since I do have a valid tcl/tk (8.4) 
installation (albeit not in /usr/bin) I avoided installing this library 
again.

2 questions:

1.
is 8.4 'enough' or do I really need 8.4.10?

2.
until recently, there was no problem in using the tcl/tk library from 
within R. but now (after the upgrade) I get

Loading Tcl/Tk interface ... Error in fun(...) : Can't find a usable 
init.tcl in the following directories:
     @TCL_IN_FRAMEWORK@ @TCL_IN_FRAMEWORK@

espeically the "@TCL_IN_FRAMEWORK@ @TCL_IN_FRAMEWORK@" line is cryptic 
to me. what is necessary to inform R of the actual location of the 
tcl/tk stuff? or do I have really to install it a second time?

thanks in advance
joerg


PS: If it _is_ in the archive (in the FAQ it is'nt), a rude hint would 
be appreciated :-)

Don't try to do something that needs to allocate 4GB of RAM?

Reformulate your problem.
The lme you run with that data attempts to allocate 4GB of memory  
which is a bit too much. Even if you put 8GB in a G5 and run 64-bit  
version of R it's likely to run out of memory or to take forever ...  
Maybe someone will be able to help you to solve your problem in a  
different way if you specify more precisely what you are trying to do  
(including size of the data etc.).

Cheers,
Simon

I don't think this is necessarily a user problem of allocating big  
chunks of memory, or at least I did experienced last days the same  
kind of issue by iterating some linear optimization problem of very  
small dimension (something like 5 rows x 5 columns matrix).
In my particular problem it was a sequence on independent calls to  
lpSolve on very small problems. Looking at "top" command on the  
shell, I've seen a growing number of vmem (VSIZE?) almost linearly  
with iteration up to 3.5 giga.
This is also occurring after forcing gc(). If i stop the iteration  
before the alloc failure, the previously allocated ram never gets  
back until I quit R itself.
I'm not able to debug myself, but I can try to provide a reproducible  
example (not these days, but later on)
I've faced the same problem on a G4 and a dual G5.

I'm curious to see the dimension of the data Alan is using, but I'm  
confident that this is not where the problem lies.

The data set is fairly big.

Again, the model I was trying to run was:
lme(ovn~tlc+geno+log(food), clinal, random=~tlc+geno+log(food)|block/ 
lat)

where,

"ovn" is a continuous, normal (length=999)
"tlc" is continuous, normal, definitely random
"food" could either be a factor with 6 levels or a numerical variable  
(making it log(food) makes a more even distribution).  Even though it  
is an experimental treatment, I would like to treat it as random  
because I am interested in the slope and its interaction with the  
"geno" variable (although, note, there are no interactions in the  
model above, as putting them in at this point would cause even more  
problems)
"geno" is genotype, 12 total, 4 from each "lat."  "geno" should  
really be treated as random too, because they are random draws from  
all genotypes in a population
"lat" is latitude, 3 total.  Right now I'm treating it as fixed.
"block" is equivalent to replicate, 2 total.

The experimental design was the following:

12 genotypes, from 3 latitudes, reared under 6 conditions, replicated  
twice with ~15-20 individuals measured from each geno x food x block  
interaction.  Because individuals from each g x f x b were reared in  
the same rearing chamber, they are not independent thus some grouping  
structure is necessary.

I appreciate your curiosity on this problem.  I know, however, that  
this forum is not the place to hack out statistical questions, but  
this memory thing seemed specific to Macs.

Cheers,
Alan

Not specifically in the statistical problem but in the dimensionality  
of your problem.

Simon,

In an email to the list in July  this year  James Wettenhall asked the 
following, regarding the creation of a mac binary package.

 >> Or are these the only choices?

are built for me.

You responded Simon with:

I would like to produce Mac binary packages so that I can install them 
on other Macs in our building, which don't have the the development 
tools on them. This is mainly for testing before I release a version to 
Bioconductor.

Is there something particularly magical about creating a binary Mac 
package as I can't seem to find much on doing it, apart from sending it 
off to CRAN. I can create a .tar.gz file on Mac or Windows and a binary 
package on Windows. but I haven't worked out the Mac binary procedure,

thanks,

Keith

I don't think this should give a memory problem. Maybe trying with a  
simpler model or cutting down the dataset will show that something is  
going wrong, by giving strange results instead of the error. Also try  
creating a  column lfood and using that instead of log(food).

By being specific to macs, does that mean the code runs properly  
under Windows or other ?

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Unable to launch R.app from R-2.2.0-r36543
Message-ID: <438C8778.4030407@bifx.org>

Summary:

I am unable to launch R.app from R-2.2.0-r36543.

Details:

I downloaded R-patched-panther.dmg from the CRAN mirror at 
www.ibiblio.org and got R-2.2.0-r36543. I installed R-Framework.pkg and 
then copied R.app into my Applications directory, overwriting my old R.app.

The new R.app is R Cocoa GUI 1.13 (2034). When I attempt to launch the 
new R.app, I get the following error:

The operation could not be completed.
An unexpected error occurred (error code -10810).

If I restore the stock R.app [R Cocoa GUI 1.13 (1915), created October 
7, 2005 5:07 PM], I can launch R.app successfully.

Mac OS X 10.4.3
PowerBook G4
2 GB RAM

Message-ID: <E04C3E7F-CF7F-4D92-B3D0-A974064557ED@smalltime.com>

I've seen a few posts on this subject, but no resolution, so here it  
is again.

I just upgraded to Mac OS 10.4 (10.4.3).

Recompiling RMySQL works fine, but it will not load once compiled,  
instead producing this error message:

 > library(RMySQL)
Loading required package: DBI
Error in dyn.load(x, as.logical(local), as.logical(now)) :
         unable to load shared library '/Library/Frameworks/

   Referenced from: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/library/ 
RMySQL/libs/RMySQL.so
   Expected in: flat namespace
Error in library(RMySQL) : .First.lib failed for 'RMySQL'


This is using R Version 2.2.0 (2005-10-06 r35749)

Any advice would be appreciated.

Thanks.

Did you upgrade to Xcode 2.2? I've noticed that since doing that  
update I've had to link against SystemStubs explicitly. I did this by  
patching SHLIB et al to link -lSystemStubs instead of -lcc_dynamic  
(which isn't needed on OS X anyway since its just a symlink to libgcc  
if it exists at all). I haven't had time to figure out what changed,  
but I do know that it works and let me get back to my research. :-)

Currently the images of nightly frameworks have broken (incomplete)  
R.app bundles - the frameworks themselves are fine. Please use stand- 
alone R.app images from
http://research.att.com/~urbanek/R/
I'll try to fix the problem once I'm back from my travels.

Not at all - it's identical to building binaries on unix, so it just  
means to run
R CMD build --binary foo.tar.gz
(or alternatively R CMD INSTALL --build ...)

AFAIR the question that James had was whether he should be doing this  
himself or whether there is some facility that we provide..

I don't think this should give a memory problem. Maybe trying with a
simpler model or cutting down the dataset will show that something is
going wrong, by giving strange results instead of the error. Also try
creating a  column lfood and using that instead of log(food).

By being specific to macs, does that mean the code runs properly
under Windows or other ?

Hi,

I upgraded 1 of my machines to 2.2 and ran into similar issues that  
Byron
reported earlier this week. For now I would suggest to stick with 2.1.

hello everybody

i really don't know if i should post thist question over here but i
was hoping somebody could help me anyway. I try to install the GDD
package in to R.

i installed the gd library with the underlying jpeg, freetype and png
libraries but R keeps telling me that it can't find libgd but the
installation didn't give any problems.

this is the error R gives.

checking for gdImageCreateFromPng in -lgd... no
configure: error: Can't find libgd!

i was searching in the configure file of GDD that maybe the Pathname
of gd was wrong but i couldnt find it.

does anybody has an idea how to solve this problem

any help is welcome thanx in advance

I think there is no risk if you use
sudo gcc_select 3.3
before building any new package against binary R.framework

a) did you ranlib the installed static libs ?

b) are they in a place searched by gcc (such as /usr/local/lib) ?

c) try

    nm libgd.a | grep gdImageCreateFromPng

    to see if the symbol is defined

I just now build 860 packages with gcc-4.0.1 and
did not have any problems.

You may have a problem if your MySQL is made for
Panther and your RMySQL is Tiger.

Xcode-2.2 comes with gcc Apple build 5247. I use
Apple build 5305 from CVS (now SVN) on 10.4.4

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] contrib.url on OSX ?!
Message-ID: <m2oe42ghek.fsf@ziti.local>

In a recent post to the Bioconductor list, Sean reported trouble with
the affy package's automagic package installation.  

The affy package is wrapping install.packages.  The issue seems to be
that on his system he sees:

> sessionInfo()
R version 2.2.0, 2005-08-11, powerpc-apple-darwin7.9.0

> contrib.url('foo')
[1] "foo/bin/macosx/2.2"

Shouldn't an R 2.2.x see the following (that's what I get):
> contrib.url("foo", type="mac.binary")
[1] "foo/bin/macosx/powerpc/contrib/2.3"      

Sean, can you try reinstalling R?  Perhaps you somehow have an older
version that doesn't have the right contrib.url function?  I'm
confused, but this seems to be the crux of your problem.

Best,

+ seth

I'll try reinstalling at some point here.  I tend to install from source, so
that may be an issue.

Perhaps someone on the r-sig-mac list will have some insight.  I
tested using both an R 2.2 binary install and an R 2.3 from source
install on OS X and I get the bin/macosx/powerpc/contrib/2.x behavior
so I don't know what is going on.

If you are in a hurry, you could redefine contrib.url.  Here is what I
have:

contrib.url <-
function (repos, type = getOption("pkgType")) 
{
    if (is.null(repos)) 
        return(NULL)
    if ("@CRAN@" %in% repos && interactive()) {
        cat(gettext("--- Please select a CRAN mirror for use in this session ---\n"))        flush.console()
        chooseCRANmirror()
        m <- match("@CRAN@", repos)
        nm <- names(repos)
        repos[m] <- getOption("repos")["CRAN"]
        if (is.null(nm)) 
            nm <- rep("", length(repos))
        nm[m] <- "CRAN"
        names(repos) <- nm
    }
    if ("@CRAN@" %in% repos) 
        stop("trying to use CRAN without setting a mirror")
    ver <- paste(R.version$major, strsplit(R.version$minor, ".", 
        fixed = TRUE)[[1]][1], sep = ".")
    res <- switch(type, source = paste(gsub("/$", "", repos), 
        "src", "contrib", sep = "/"), mac.binary = paste(gsub("/$", 
        "", repos), "bin", "macosx", R.version$arch, "contrib", 
        ver, sep = "/"), win.binary = paste(gsub("/$", "", repos), 
        "bin", "windows", "contrib", ver, sep = "/"))
    res
}

+ seth

Thanks, Byron.  I tried editing SHLIB, but I still had the same  
probem.  I did check my version of XCode and it was 2.1.  I updated  
XCode to 2.2 and recompiled, and this time it worked.  I never undid  
the SHLIB modification, so I don't know whether or not that was  
required in the context of the XCode update.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Error compiling gnlm package from source.
Message-ID: <a5ff267d7e5b5b0f871cd8f824fc1356@ntlworld.com>

Hi

I am new to R and am trying to install the package gnlm (obtained from 
http://popgen.unimaas.nl/~jlindsey/rcode.html) from source but keep 
getting the following messages.


* Installing *source* package 'gnlm' ...

-I/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/include  
-I/usr/local/include   -fno-common  -g -O2 -c stable.c -o stable.o

** Removing

make: *** [gnlm.so] Error 1
ERROR: compilation failed for package 'gnlm'

i am running OS 10.3.9, R 1.13

Any pointers to where I might look to resolve this issue would be much 
appreciated!
