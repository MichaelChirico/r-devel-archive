This seems to come from a CLT update: my Catalina box updated to 12.0 
beta 5 overnight.  And that has defaulted the SDK to 11.0.

I wish they would not do that -- it is not the first time they have 
installed a beta CLT without asking and set the SDK for a future OS.

I have tweaked configure for R-devel and R-patched so they install, but 
likely the better answer for me is to downgrade the CLT to 11.5 or set 
an SDK.

A couple more points on this

1) Apple's svn is 1.10.4, Simon's is 1.14.0 so you probably should not 
mix checkouts done with the different versions.

2) Digging amongst the versions available on developer.apple.com, CLT 
11.3.1 contained svn etc, 11.5 did not (but did not remove existing 
tools, and neither did betas of 12).

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] plot window not showing most recent plot?
Message-ID: <031E8FFE-14A0-42C7-BFE3-3B978A8B81F9@gmail.com>

In R version: R version 4.0.2 (2020-06-22), I?m seeing the plot window not advance when a new ggplot is drawn.
calls to plot() advance the quartz window to the newest ?frame?, but calls to ggplot2::qplot() show the graph only the first time the function is called in the quartz window?s history.

For subsequent qplots, the pane does not advance to show the new plot, instead staying on which ever ?frame? in the plot history it was at.

repro

plot(wt ~ mpg, data=mtcars) # displays
ggplot2::qplot(mpg, wt, data=mtcars) # doesn't display

close quartz window

qplot(mpg, wt, data=mtcars) # displays
plot(wt ~ mpg, data=mtcars) # displays
qplot(mpg, wt, data=mtcars) # doesn't display

try cmd-] to advance forward into current history? nothing happens (newest plot is not in the (forward) history

try cmd-[ to go back, then cmd-]  cmd-]  to go forward into current history? newest plot displays as it should have the first time

Which front end are you using?  The cmd-] and cmd-[ don't do anything in 
the ones I'm using.

R for R 4.0.2 GUI 1.72 Catalina build (7847)

Oops, I was going off muscle memory - I see that Quartz:Forward and Back are set to "? tab" and "?? tab"  (which can't do anything as they're captured by the app switcher).

What are you seeing as the keys for Quartz:Forward and Quartz:Back?

Playing around, ? left-arrow works to go back one graph, but only one time, and ? right arrow doesn't do anything.

Clicking the actual menu items when the quartz window contains 2 graphs, back take me back, but then forward doesn't take me forward...

Works fine for me when started from R in Terminal. Cmd-leftarrow and Cmd-rightarrow do their thing, as listed in the menu - provided the graphics window has focus, otherwise they switch virtual desktops (of course).

OK. Perhaps it's another Big Sur thing.

Hello!  I am a brand-new useR and have installed R-4.0.2.pkg and XQuartz on my macOS 10.15.6.  The R GUI launches fine, but when I type 'demo()', the application hangs (even with XQuartz running).  However, I can run from the CLI in my XQuartz window just fine.  Where can I go to get help to get up and running? Thank you.

I have the same version of macOS and R. I do not have any problem with
'demo()' but
'demo(package = .packages(all.available = TRUE))' hangs with the spinning
ball until I force quit R.

Which Rgui version is this? A somewhat similar issue with opening files on some platforms was fixed shortly after 4.0.2 in Rgui rev 7849. 

I forget whether this was pushed to the CRAN binary (my install has 7847). At any rate, if yours is older, you may want to try Rgui.app from https://mac.r-project.org

I am experiencing my issues with the same version: R.app 1.72, rev 7847.
I?ll attempt a rev 7849 download.

Thank you both for responding!

I am pleased to announce that Peter?s suggestion worked!  I just downloaded
and installed the R-4.0.0 (Patched) from the Mac nightly builds site and
now R.app is version 1.73 and the rev is 7883.  The command ?demo()? worked
just fine.  Thank you very much!

Message-ID: <CAN5WjX+BchTn15V9qMcLa+z0Q2fCsiZNh6n1SYVJtkmEkZMrXg@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings,

As I?m getting familiar with R, I have some basic questions that I thought
of to shoot to useRs:

1. When looking up library functions, symbols, objects, etc., is there a
Google-style ?global search? capability for all that is available with my
installation?  Or is it just all accessible via navigating the help() tree?
2. Are these objects, etc. stored on disk somewhere, or are they only
accessible via the interfaces?  For example, I would be interested to see
the source code for the demo examples to learn how to do certain things, if
this is possible.  (It appeared as if the code for each demo that is
executed as part of the ?demo()? command displayed in my R console, but I
just want to be sure about this.)
3. How does one restore a saved session automatically?  Is that saved in a
file or files anywhere on the local filesystem?
4. I tried to read in a set of dummy space-delimited data saved in an
absolute path on my computer, but it would not work.  I tried something in
another path that did not have a subfolder with a space in it (I.e. I plan
on storing my data in a folder called ?R Documents? or something similar)
and that didn?t work either, so I?m still wondering whether or not (a)
things have to be in the library location (it seems like you could
customize that) and (b) whether R recognizes spaces in file paths.

Please keep in mind that I am consulting the documentation first, but maybe
not doing a global Google search for examples of these things.  I?m trying
to remember to do both as I go along, so as not to bother everyone.

Regards and thanks in advance,
Mike

You should review the ListInfo material. Most of these questions have nothing to do with the Mac version of R.

You should be trying help.search() or it's shortcut `??`

Not sure what you are considering "interfaces". Pretty much everything is on disk.

They are generally automagically reloaded if you exited in a manner that saved them and restart from the same directory. The state of the previous session is stored in a special .Rdata file which is invisible to Macs and Windoze machines by default. You need to modify your system file manage to see them. Read about .Rdata files and how to use them.

Sadder words were never written, but most of the sadness derives from the failure to efficiently communicate what "it" actually was.

R does recognize space on a Mac. You need to provide actual code. I cannot intuit what errors you are making from this description.

Well you are not reading the documentation for this list (or any of the several R-project list) since you are posting in HTML.

How to find the demo files is contained in the demo help. Type ?demo

Try using file.choose() to locate files using a dialog and it will return the full name. Spaces shouldn?t matter provided that everything is enclosed in quotes. Most people don?t use absolute references. They set the working directory and then just use the name of the file. See under the Misc menu.

Also, how do you "read in" the data? Usually, read.table() or somesuch would be involved, although RStudio has an "Import data" functionality.

For those who haven't checked in a while, the sad state of affairs over 
at StackOverflow.com is that 99% of the R-tagged questions there are at 
this level of [non]understanding.   We should consider ourselves very 
lucky that r-sig-mac remains almost entirely devoid of such stuff.

My view on these things is to either not respond, or try to increase
the level of understanding so that future questions may be better.? I
don't think you meant it that way, but I can't imagine anyone seeing
this as the aftermath of asking a question is going to feel
particularly good about themselves.

Thank you, Brodie.  I can do without the 1992 level of Useness sarcasm when
reaching out for answers.  I consulted the documentation, and they give a
very specific example.  I consulted the tutorial, and it gives a very
specific example.  Neither were suited to identifying answers to my own
particular questions.  At least going forward, I will know who to look to
for useful information and helpful guidance, and likely will suggest
documentation changes as I go.  And you are correct, I was not at all
pleased to see this harsh level of reaction; some people perhaps feel the
only power they have in their lives is to assert some supposed level of
superiority rather than seeking to understand and be helpful.

Great, thank you.  I was following along the tutorial session provided in
the official documentation and I could not make sense of how they were
opening the Michelson-Morely experimental data.  It seemed as if they were
forcing the source file to be read in from some library location, where in
all likelihood, users would prefer to make custom locations.  I will check
into both of your suggestions.  I appreciate the help!

Try using file.choose() to locate files using a dialog and it will return
the full name. Spaces shouldn?t matter provided that everything is enclosed
in quotes. Most people don?t use absolute references. They set the working
directory and then just use the name of the file. See under the Misc menu.

Hi Peter,

Here is a snippet of the code I was trying to start with:

filepath1 <- file("/Users/michaelfeher/Documents/R
Documents/COVID19/20200906-1822-total-cases-jones.data")
filepath1
TotalCasesJones <- read.table(filepath1)

This definitely did not work for me.

Also, how do you "read in" the data? Usually, read.table() or somesuch
would be involved, although RStudio has an "Import data" functionality.

Mike,

There are probably a couple of issues here to think about:

1. Do you have reason to think this is a Mac specific issue?? If not
?? this is likely not the right mailing list.? Perhaps r-help might be
?? better, although I do think you will find more people willing to
?? pitch in on Stackoverflow (but avoid cross-posting, so since you
?? have already posted here you might need to hope someone is willing
?? to provide you an answer).

2. The reason you are getting the reactions you are in this thread
?? (apart from the mac-specific issue) is that there is not enough
?? information for others to debug your problems.? E.g.? what does the
?? file look like, in what way does it "definitely not work"?.? Do you
?? get an error?? Or do you import something that doesn't look like
?? what you expected?? These are all things that are needed by anyone
?? that will want to help you, and it frustrates some that you are not
?? providing them of your own initiative.

If I were in your shoes I would try my luck on stackoverflow, or
alternatively, read through several threads on R-help to figure out
how the Q/A process works there and ask questions in ways that are
likely to elicit answers.? This is not easy to do and take some work
to figure out, but when asking for folks time to help you it is a good
idea to try to do some home work ahead of time.

I speak only for myself, and sincerely hope this non-answer is helpful
to you even if it doesn't actually address your questions.

Best,

Brodie.

Hi Brodie,

Thanks for your suggestions, I definitely appreciate it.

Yes, I realize these aren?t Mac-specific questions, so forgive a new member
the mistake of accidentally posting to the wrong listserv.  I realized that
after the fact, but there it is.

I think I discovered two problems today that I got worked out.  The first
was a permissions problem that is macOS-specific: I installed XQuartz, and
inside my xterms, I was unable even execute simple commands such as ?ls?.
Google to the rescue.  After that, I got the permissions sorted out, and
those commands worked just fine.  I suspect because I couldn?t even do
things like that, that that?s why I was getting (IIRC) ?Operation not
permitted? errors *inside of R* trying to open a file.  Being new to it, it
appeared to me that R was the cause of my problem.  Once I got that sorted
out, it was no issue.

The second problem was figuring out which file operation method to use.
 file.choose() worked for me, and it was quite easy to wrap this with a
read.table(), so that was a nice bit of learning.  (The CLI did not permit
me to do anything other than type in a fully-qualified path to my data
files, but in R.app, it nicely opened up a file selection dialog, about
which I was very pleased.)

One of the reasons I didn?t initially provide a lot of supplementary
information was that I figured if anyone had any suggestions based on what
the problem sounded like, they might have vectored me in the right
direction.  Typically I provide a lot of detail up front but that ends up
getting lost on people, so I?ve learned to start general and then if
they?re willing to be helpful, I?ll gladly supply the info.

I hadn?t thought of Stack Overflow, but based on the initial reax here, I
started Googling other sites that might provide more useful examples
without the backtalk.  Thirty years on the Internet and some things never
change. ;)

Thank you again!
Mike

Not work how? You need to tell us what kind of errors you see, otherwise, we can only guess.

I'd lose the file() construct. It sets up a connection object, which can be less than useful when read.table reads the file several time in order to decipher the column structure of the file.

So plain

filepath1 <- "/Users/michaelfeher/Documents/R Documents/COVID19/20200906-1822-total-cases-jones.data"

should be OK, provided that the file actually exists. In particular, check that the space in "R Documents" really is a space and not something that just looks like a space (no-break space is a common culprit).

If you can read the file, but it comes out weird, then you need to diddle the arguments to read.table, e.g.

> filepath <- "~/tmp/R files/test.data"
> read.table(filepath)
  V1 V2
1  x  y
2  1  2
3  3  7
4  9 13
> read.table(filepath, header=TRUE)
  x  y
1 1  2
2 3  7
3 9 13

Dear Mike,

I remember so very well the time when I struggled with exactly the same
things, reading a file seeming like an almost insurmountable task.
However, given this actually is very simple I can also understand the
reactions you got. Imagine every newbie asking these questions over
and over again, in a time where there is so much information out there to
figure it out quite easy.

The documentation might be a little cryptic, I give you that. But there are
so many other resources, most of them free, that you can read to understand
how this works. I would warmly recommend some of the contributed
introductory materials from:
https://cran.r-project.org/other-docs.html

There are also plenty of websites to teach R interactively, and all of them
offer this kind of information, without exception, since this really is
part of the very basics in R.

What I learned over the years is that help on this list is invaluable. But
all of the contributors share their own time, and help must be required in
such a way that it (at least) makes it obvious you did first try to do your
homework. Most of the time, asking the right question(s) reveals the answer
and at some point you will only need to browse past similar questions to
find the answer you want.

Linked to that, one other thing I learned is my question is almost never
unique and most likely somebody else asked something at least similar in
the past. Doing your homework also means trying to dig in the archives,
which is pretty easy these days using Google.

Should you make this effort and make it evident in your question that you
did try to read on your own, I'm sure it would be easy for other people to
point you in the right direction. Because this is almost always what I
need: a pointer, and then I can figure it out on my own.

Rest assured this is a very friendly email list, and I consider myself
lucky to be part of this community. Despite knowing this for so many years,
I still make mistakes and consume too much of others' time. But at least I
am aware of that, and extremely grateful for the help I get.

I hope this helps,
Adrian

Though what is shown below is from the RStudio repository,  I have tried several others,  including R-cloud.  Is it just something on my end or are there problems.  CRAN shows the versions trying to be installed.

Roy,

it looks like the sync from the Mac master to CRAN was incomplete for some reason (CCing CRAN in case there was some error). I presume it will fix itself on next sync, but you can use the Mac master in the meantime which worked for me:

install.packages(c("rpf", "statespacer", "tmap", "workflows"),,"https://mac.R-project.org")

Cheers,
Simon

Thanks.  They eventually showed up.  What was weird was if you asked to check for packages available to be updated,  they were listed,  but then failed on the update.   I know nothing about how this system works  but it appears the "list" of what is new is somehow separate from a file list on the server,  if that is making any sense.  And this was true using the R-GUI as well as RStudio,  and I think I tried 3 different repositories,  including R-Cloud.  So that got me worried there was something nutty on my end.

Anyway,  thanks for the work.  One package had some things I particularly wanted to check out.

Yes, that's how it works - the list is in the PACKAGES file and that is what the GUIs and available.packages() use. So what happened was that CRAN has likely started the sync in the middle of the build machine pushing the content* so the PACKAGES file was already updated, but not all the new files were there yet. And because CRAN syncs only once in a few hours there was a discrepancy between the PACKAGES file and the tgz files until the next sync.

Cheers,
Simon

* - the setup is a bit convoluted because both CRAN and the Mac build machine are behind firewalls, so they use a content server in the middle to synchronize the repository, and, each of the three pieces is on a different continent :).

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Bug crash on opening a document
Message-ID: <5024D4F1-98D8-4DF8-AF16-C08206AD63A2@york.ac.uk>

Hi, 

When I open a .R document from finder, I get a crash and the Mac reports ?Application not responding? On force quit I get a bug report as below
I get a similar crash when opening a document from the R menu

I never see any of the document window

Thanks

Chris,

please download the latest version from

https://mac.r-project.org/

in particular you can also just download the updated R GUI from that page (which you can run directly from the image) to see if the issue has been fixed in the meantime since there was one major crash issue fixed since the release.

Thanks,
Simon

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Building R 4.0.2 from source via clang/xcode for MKL on
 macOS
Message-ID: <CAJfh=dJZpMpp9emtPN0mhrU8kBw9Gdo1qAV=R3j-TrS4wwtiZQ@mail.gmail.com>

I wanted to build R from source on macos (10.15.5) so I could include
Intel's MKL.  So I first looked at building R from source without MKL.

>From the installation doc, I modified config.site to have the following:

CC=clang
OBJC=$CC
FC=/usr/local/bin/gfortran
CXX=clang++


I then ran configuration via the command:

./configure -C --enable-R-shlib --enable-memory-profiling
--x-includes=/opt/X11/include --x-libraries=/opt/X11/lib
PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/X11/lib/pkgconfig:/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig:/usr/lib/pkgconfig


And received the following information and error:

checking if bzip2 version >= 1.0.6... no
checking whether bzip2 support suffices... configure: error: bzip2 library
and headers are required


By looking at the log, I saw a compiler error due to an implicit function.
I then made the following change in config.site:

CFLAGS='-Wno-implicit-function-declaration -g -O2''


And configure now ran without errors.

However, when I looked at configuring to use MKL, I discovered that MKL on
macos does not support gnu fortran so, unless I purchase Intel's Fortran
compiler, it looks like I'm sol.

Has anyone built R with MKL on macos (10.15)?  In any event, I wanted to at
least note the issue and work around I encountered when building R on
macos with clang/xcode.

Rollin,

it has been several years since I last tested MKL, so take it with a grain of salt, but in general you don't necessarily have to build R with MKL in order to use it - you only need to use --enable-BLAS-shlib and link to any ABI-compatible BLAS which can be vecLib as well. Then you can change the link from vecLib to MKL in the BLAS stub. Note that we only need the C ABI, there are wrappers vecLibg95f.* which re-map the F entry points to C entry points as to avoid Fortran ABI issues thus you don't care about the Fortran. However, historically, MKL has not been much more performant than vecLib so it's unclear if it is worth the hassle. As with any accelerated BLAS, note that this may have effects on results in R.

Cheers,
Simon

Hi Simon,
Thanks for the info.  I was totally unaware of ABI, vecLib, etc and that
Apple has blas, lapack, etc.  But after reading up on this and re-reading
your email, I'm beginning to understand more about this.

So, I would like to first checkout vecLib.  From what you say, would I have
to do something like the following?

./configure --enable-BLAS-shlib --with-blas="-lBLAS"  ...

Is this also possible with LAPACK?

tx again.
cheers, roy

In my understanding, almost all of the speed up comes from using an
optimized BLAS. Optimizing LAPACK tend to have negligible impact on
performance. At least that is my impression, although I won't say I'm an
expert.

Kasper

To use veclib you need
   --with-blas="-framework Accelerate"

My full building script on OS X is currently

../${SRCDIR}/configure SHELL='/bin/bash' \
  --prefix=/usr/local/R/${R_VERSION} --disable-R-framework\
  CC="/usr/local/clang8/bin/clang" \
  CXX="/usr/local/clang8/bin/clang++" \
  F77="/usr/local/gfortran/bin/gfortran" \
  FC="/usr/local/gfortran/bin/gfortran" \
  OBJC="clang" \
  CFLAGS="-Wall -mtune=native -g -O2" \
  CXXFLAGS="-Wall -mtune=native -g -O2" \
  OBJCFLAGS="-Wall -mtune=native -g -O2 -fobjc-exceptions" \
  F77FLAGS="-Wall -g -O2 -mtune=generic" \
  FCFLAGS="$F77FLAGS" \
  FLIBS="-L/usr/local/gfortran/lib/gcc/x86_64-apple-darwin15/6.1.0
-L/usr/local/gfortran/lib -lgfortran -lquadmath -lm" \
  LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/clang8/lib -L/usr/local/lib" \
  DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/clang8/lib:/usr/local/lib" \

PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/opt/X11/lib/pkgconfig:/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig:/usr/lib/pkgconfig"
\
  JAVA_HOME="/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Home" \
  JAVA_CPPFLAGS="-I/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Headers" \
  JAVA_LD_LIBRARY_PATH="" \
  JAVA_LIBS="-framework JavaVM" \
  --enable-memory-profiling\
  --x-includes=/opt/X11/include --x-libraries=/opt/X11/lib\
  --with-blas="-framework Accelerate" | tee ../configure-${R_VERSION}

although I think we have moved back to Apple's clang for C etc compiler for
the CRAN version of R instead of Simon's clang8.

Best,
Kasper

Details are in the R-admin manual, including that R fails one of its checks.

Simon's calling this vecLib is a bit misleading.  'vecLib' was a 
vectorized library for PPC Macs, and the name lives on for a small part 
of the Accelerate framework.  The part that supplies an enhanced BLAS is 
different, and is based on ATLAS for x86_64 CPUs.

Incidentally, on the configuration issue -- had you followed the posting 
guide and either read the current manual or tried R-patched you would 
not have encountered the problem (which AFAWK is very recent, from the 
Command Line Tools for Xcode 12, released only for rather recent 
versions of Catalina and pre-Big Sur about 10 days ago).  Now documented at

This is just the way Apple names it (now on all platforms), the name has a long history and was related to PPC, but Apple chose not to change it even though it doesn't actually contain any PowerPC code anymore. Accelerate is just a stub that combines vecLib and vImage, and since R only uses vecLib it is sufficient to link to vecLib. I'm just referring to the actual framework involved and the vecLib framework itself contains all the libraries including LAPACK and BLAS ( https://developer.apple.com/documentation/accelerate/veclib ).

Cheers,
Simon

Thanks to all for the info and to Kasper for the complete options in
building R on macos.  Using xcode clang/blas, I successfully built R 4.0.2
with the accelerate framework (or vecLib).  I did some initial performance
tests  using the scripts from
https://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2014/10/revolution-r-open-mkl.html (a
cross product and a Cholesky factorization).

   1. R 4.0.2 macos built with xcode/clang; without accelerate:    cross
   product: 151 secs elapsed / 151 secs user; factorization: 23 secs elapsed /
   23 secs user
   2. R 4.0.2 macos built with xcode/clang; with accelerate:        cross
   product: 1.7 secs elapsed / 6.3 secs user; factorization: 0.6 secs elapsed
   / 1.9 secs user
   3. R 4.0.2 w/ MKL sequential via ubuntu/docker on mac:        cross
   product: 5 secs elapsed / 5 secs user; factorization: 0.94 secs elapsed /
   0.9 secs user
   4. R 4.0.2 w/ MKL parallel via ubuntu/docker on mac:             cross
   product: 2.8 secs elapsed / 5.3 secs user; factorization: 0.55 secs elapsed
   / 0.9 secs user

btw, these tests were done on:

   - macos 10.15.7
   - 2018 mac mini
   - 3.6 GHZ, quad core, 16 GB memory


cheers, roy
