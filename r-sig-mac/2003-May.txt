Message-ID: <004D0B56-7C76-11D7-8BB5-003065CC4CB8@mclink.it>

Release 1.7.0 of Carbon R should now be present on CRAN.

Apart from the 1.7.x patches, 1.7.0 is the latest release of Carbon R.

For this release I'll build as much packages as possibile. These will 
come a bit later.

Our effort are now concentrated to provide a GUI for the Darwin port of 
R which will become the only Macintosh (MacOS X actually) port. This is 
planned to work with release 1.8.0 of R.

Message-ID: <8AC1994F-7E25-11D7-A17E-003065CC4CB8@mclink.it>

I have uploaded just now on CRAN several prebuilt contributed packages 
for Carbon R 1.7.0.

These include the Bioconductor 1.1 bundle as well.

As 1.7.0 is the last Carbon port of R this applies to the packages as 
well, i.e. I will not build more packages or new releases of them (for 
example the forthcaoming version of Bioconductor)

If you really need some additional package which is not there you can 
try to write me and I'll do my best but, if they're not present, I was 
probably unable to build them for you.

In a couple of days you should find these packages mirrored over the 
CRAN.

Message-ID: <F0341B2F-7FB2-11D7-BE52-000393CD9F1A@nuffield.oxford.ac.uk>

Has anyone got Barry Rowlingson's "Rmap" package (see
    http://www.maths.lancs.ac.uk/Software/Rmap/
) working on OS X?

I have tried and failed.  I reckon I didn't do the right things with 
the proj4 and shapelib libraries, to build them as shared libraries 
("dylibs"??).  Can someone give me hints on how to do that, and whether 
I need to do anything OSX-specific to the Makevars in file in Rmap/Src 
(eg to tell it to look for blah.dylib rather than blah.so?  is that 
necessary?)

All the best,
David

Whether these need to be linked as bundles or dylibs depends on what  
they are used
for subsequently. Dylibs are for linking against, and if all else fails  
you can hack the
make to use static archives -- bundles are for loading at run time into  
a running
application (elsewhere know as plugins or modules), in R we use foo.so  
for
bundles.

I will take a look at Rmap asap to see what is needed.

I changed my webserver on gifi to an apache2 server

R-1.7.0 in the old document root, of course, which means that if
you downloaded the new file today you really downloaded the
old file. If you want it, you have to try again, and check the date
just to make sure.

Thanks. Yes, this is a recurring mistake, due to the idiotic naming  
that fink
once had. Adding a softlink

sudo ln -s libncurses.5.0.3.dylib libncurses.dylib.5

in /sw/lib probably solves the problem. I will add the softlink to to  
next
update (and recompile akima)

Works fine if R is started from a Terminal window on Mac OS X and we use

For our purposes, OS X just another Unix, and thus it uses
X11 for graphics, and it uses the tcl/tk compiled for X11.

There is no R for OS X yet that uses the native(Aqua) tcl/tk.
You can run R by using the Python IDE and Rpy, and then
r.library("Rcmdr") works and puts up a native tcl/tk interface.
But this does not call back properly to the underlying R yet,
which is not that surprising since it has to go
through the Rpy, Tkinter, and Python layers to get to R.
Many things can go wrong on the way.

Hi,

I'm having problems compiling R 1.7.0 on my mac (OS 10.2.6; fink

months ago:

Did anyone else get this, and resolve it?  I followed the advice from
Jan in response to Jean's email:

I tried the "fink rebuild g77", but no joy.  Did anyone else get a
solution to this?  Also, like Jean, I compiled 1.6.2 on the mac
without problems.

here is what fink currently reports for g77, and the gcc info:

Just to follow up on this:  Jan suggested using the following config
flags:

  --with-blas="-framework vecLib" --with-lapack

which solved the problem.  Thanks Jan.

What follow are the minimum requirements to build R-1.7.0 on MacOSX 
10.2.6 I have obtained.
It will build a Darwin/X11 R.
These are the steps I have done on a virgin machine. I hope it can be 
useful to you too.

* install Dec 2002 Apple Developer Tools
* install Xfree86 from Apple site
* install fink from (0.5.2 the latest version)
     http://fink.sourceforge.net/
    edit the .cshrc and .tcshrc accordingly to what you find on the fink 
webpage (this is needed to set the path correctly)
    edit /sw/etc/fink.conf by adding "unstable/main" at the
    end of the line starting with "Trees:"
* install g77 from the unstable tree of fink
    sudo fink install g77
* install dlcompat library from:  
http://www.opendarwin.org/projects/dlcompat/
   use the following to configure/install dlcompat

   make clean
   ./configure --enable-fink
   make
   sudo make install

* unpack R-1.7.0 tar archive and cd inside the dir R-1.7.0
   configure with:
   ./configure --enable-R-shlib --with-blas='-framework vecLib' 
--with-lapack

   and then build R with:
   make

I possibly forgot that I have also install bzlib2 with the i-installer, 
but this should not create problems in case you haven't.

If you want to have a g77 not coming from fink you can try to install 
g77 3.1 from

http://gravity.psu.edu/~khanna/hpc.html

I can build a clean R (both 1.7.0 and today patched R) without having 
anything from fink installed (I remove /sw directory from my system).

I've also installed dlcompat as I wrote in a previous msg:

from http://www.opendarwin.org/projects/dlcompat/

     use the following to configure/install

   make clean
   ./configure --enable-fink
   make

Configuring R with

./configure --enable-R-shlib --with-blas='-framework vecLib' 
--with-lapack


gives you the following capabilities

This --enable-fink option looks like a very good thing. Thank you.

How does it work? Does it mean that during installation the necessary 
files are downloaded from fink, used during make, and then deleted?

I find jpeg and tcltk to be very useful; does --enable-fink include 
them among the capabilities?

I notice that cledit is shown as FALSE among the capabilities listed 
below. Is that the capability that is enabled when libreadlines is 
available? If so, I feel that it is essential.

I think the enable-fink is an option to compile dlcompar from opendarwin

you can use them from fink or install them in /usr/local yourself.  
observe that darwinports, the other
major porting project, installs everything in /opt, which is not much  
better than /sw

yes, command-line edit is readline, again either from fink or your own  
in /usr/lib


it seems to me fink is (still) a necessary evil, and we should not get  
to be too worked up about it

this option is sensible only to the building phase of dlcompat. This 
options is needed to control the way symbol names in the dlls are 
treated.

yes, I need to fix this too and I agree it is essential.

absolutely, but this version of dlcompat installa in the right place in  
/usr

yes it is for few things but my aim is to let the "standard" mac user  
be able to build (R and) the packages on its own.
The main problem with fink is that you need to know several things (for  
example as pointed out by you, the g77 must to be from the unstable  
tree of fink and you have to configure fink for this).

Fink is not "evil" :) it is really good, but I would like people to  
install things they need to build R using double-clicking installers  
and so on and I'm also looking forward for the next Apple Dev. Tools to  
see what's inside.
Probably Jan knows better then me what's going on.

The new g77 in fink/unstable is 3.3. It fails to build R, unless
I setenv LDFLAGS to -lcc_dynamic.

I now also

setenv MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET 10.2

which uses the various dylibs as weak libraries.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] some  notes on building Darwin R
Message-ID: <733EDB19-93A5-11D7-98D1-003065CC4CB8@mclink.it>

Here you find some step by step instructions on how to build Darwin/X11 
R.

http://www.economia.unimi.it/R/

I'll update this page as soon as I obtain new interesting steps ahead.

I'm thinking about prepearing an installer package that does all the 
work, a sort of R SDK that allows the unexpert MacOS R user (or one 
that has just switched to OS X) to have all ready to be able to 
download and build packages on his own with simple one click. I'll add 
the part on tcl/tk as soon as I have implemented the new event loop.


Stefano

p.s. this are intended to be my personal notes so I hope you'll improve 
them. I assume also that MacOSX R-devels know the other way round (i.e. 
fink etc) and Jan's build.
