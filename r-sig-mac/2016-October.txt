Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] infinite hang with beachball when using GUI to save
	plots as PDF
Message-ID: <11AA60B9-E38A-4097-9052-0ADB570EFB5A@gmail.com>

I am experiencing the infinite hang with beachball issue when saving plots as PDF using the File > Save or File > Save As? menu options in R 3.3.1 GUI 1.68 Mavericks build (7238) with macOS Sierra. This is a frustrating issue as it requires a forced quit to resolve the hang. 

If I can be of assistance in tracking the bug down, please let me know what you need. Console does not seem to indicate any particular errors but there may be log files of which I am unaware. Hang reports (8 minutes apart) are available in the linked gists:

The bug was first described in the report linked below and is marked unconfirmed with no action for a few months. I wanted to keep it on the radar as an active issue for some users.

I just tried a save as PDF from build "R.app GUI 1.68 (7250)" on macOS
Sierra and could not reproduce your situation.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] R editor freezes after running a script
Message-ID: <02236601-35B2-4A6B-A61B-1BC4C5A05D29@upr.edu>

Hello.

I am running R (3.3.1) with R Commander (2.3-0) and XQuartz (2.7.9) on an iMac (late 2012) with Sierra. RAM is 32 GB. The file I am working with has about 350,000 records and 200 variables.

 After running a script from the R console (using either the GLM or epiR libraries) the editor freezes when I try to open a new script, and I get the spinning beach ball. When the editor freezes, I still have at least 20 GB of free RAM. The only way out is to force quit R.

The epiR script repeats a series of calculations for a group of about 30 2 x 2 tables (epi2by2). The GLIM script runs Poisson regression with robust variance estimation. Both scripts run smoothly.

 I do see this behavior when running R from RStudio (0.99.903) plus R Commander and using the RStudio console to run the scripts.

The issue does not disappear when I reinstall R. 

Thanks.

I tried to replicate the crash by using R without R Commander, and I could not. I tried again with R and R Commander, and now I cannot replicate the crash either.

I was running an antivirus program (Avast) when the issue came out, which I uninstalled yesterday. This is the only change in my setup that might explain the original issue, though I am not sure. 

Thanks.

Dear Jose,

Is it possible that you have app nap turned on for R.app, as it is by default? If so, R can appear to freeze when the its window isn't visible. If you experience the problem again, you might try turning app nap off via the Rcmdr Tools menu.

I hope this helps,
 John

Message-ID: <CALStW+re1_R=HDEupNgza0QTFWNOyiAJvZro5KfHHOCwv4nepw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have an issue on Mac OS ElCapitan ( just now upgraded to sierra) with
Xcode 7 and gfortran 6.1 ( downloaded from
https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortranBinaries. ).  I'm developing an R package
and wants to make it portable.

The package was working fine until October 18th along with a Makevar file
created under ~/.R. The Makevar file contains :
F77 = gfortran
FC = gfortran
FLIBS = -L/usr/local/gfortran/lib

(Please refer:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/40092423/r-package-with-fortran-source-code-how-to-make-makevars-file-under-pkgname-s/40127535#40127535
).

But now when I run R CMD CHECK on my system, its throws the
following error:

* installing *source* package ?EpiILM? ...
** libs
gfortran-4.8  -fPIC -Wall -g -O2  -c  Edata.f95 -o Edata.o
make: gfortran-4.8: No such file or directory
make: *** [Edata.o] Error 1
ERROR: compilation failed for package ?EpiILM?
* removing ?/Users/Vineetha/Desktop/EpiILM.Rcheck/EpiILM?

Basically, my Makevar file is not resolving the issue now.  Any help would
be appreciated.

Thanks,
Vineetha

The R binaries are built using gfortran v4.8.2; can you not build your package using that instead?

Hi Ken,

 Its not working with Makevar anymore. I guess I have to degrade to
gfortran4.8.2. Will try that.

Thank you,

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] crash bug report
Message-ID: <1433053A-8107-4EE0-BD8B-D80A7518AE92@univ-poitiers.fr>

Hello,

This is a report for two bugs with R gui R 3.3.0 GUI 1.68 Mavericks build (7202) 

########Bug 1

occurring with Sierra 16A323

If you have an R (script) file open that has never been saved to disk and you hit an issue forcing you to force-quit the GUI (could be an issue with your own code) :
Upon relaunch, the app would reopen the unsaved file and will become unresponsive (beach ball), forcing to force-quit again. The unsaved file cannot be closed. 
This will happen endlessly.

If some R files are removed (.Rapp.history), the app may launch without stalling, but throws a bug in the console (in red) telling to quit the app. Fortunately, at this stage, the unsaved file can be closed, which ends the issue upon next relaunch.
I?m note quite sure whether removing .Rapp.history was the actual solution, or another random change I don?t know about. 

Some users may be trapped in this issue without solution.


########Bug 2
Occurring since El Capitan (also in Sierra)

- Save-as an R script file via shift-cmd-s and (or the menu)
- In the save panel, click a file in the browser (you may want to replace it),


The app may become unresponsive upon clicking the file. 

It does not alway happen. But I encountered it several times when trying the save a file that was reopened automatically after force-quitting R, and whose name had "saved automatically" appended to it (or something similar, I use the French GUI). 

Thank you for your consideration.

Jean

Hello,

 I removed gfortran 6.1 and installed gfortran v4.8.2.

Now i have another error:

gfortran-4.8  -fPIC -Wall -g -O2  -c  test.f95 -o test.o

gfortran-4.8: warning: couldn?t understand kern.osversion ?16.0.0

gfortran-4.8 -dynamiclib -Wl,-headerpad_max_install_names -undefined
dynamic_lookup -single_module -multiply_defined suppress
-L/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/lib -L/usr/local/lib -o test.so
test.o -F/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/.. -framework R -Wl,-framework
-Wl,CoreFoundation

gfortran-4.8: warning: couldn?t understand kern.osversion ?16.0.0

ld: library not found for -ldylib1.o

collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status

make: *** [test.so] Error 1


Any idea what this means or how I can solve? I have limited knowledge on
these installations.


Thanks,

Vineetha

Can you check if the command line tools are installed by running:

xcode-select --install

in terminal.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] How to put below code in Automator in iOS
Message-ID: <CA+dpOJnO_jT8brboERoFGLjeeGh40oFy422F-cN3R-Twgq8jRA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Previously I posted this same thread in general R help, however folks
there suggested to post in this specialized group for better answer.

I have a piece of code available here

http://mcu.edu.tw/~chenmh/teaching/project/r/reference/RTclTkExamples/radiobuttons.html

Now I put that code in a .R file and then created an .app file in Mac
using Automator as explained below

https://www.r-bloggers.com/how-to-source-an-r-script-automatically-on-a-mac-using-automator-and-ical/

Surprisingly what I see is that, when I put that R code in a .app
file, R fails to pop up the input window, which otherwise is fine when
I just copy paste that code in R window.

Could you please help if I need to have anything extra so that my .app
will be able to take the input.

Thanks for your time.

You should post the code that is in your .R file.

I have further concerns that I should have mentioned because I suspect you're trying to use functions that are not designed to be used inside Rscript process. The Tcl/Tk functions are designed to use in interactive sessions.

And some searching on this matter shows that there have been prior suggested approaches to starting interactive R processes from a system console session:

Hi,

The code is same as in that page. i.e.

require(tcltk)

tt <- tktoplevel()
rb1 <- tkradiobutton(tt)
rb2 <- tkradiobutton(tt)
rbValue <- tclVar("oranges")
tkconfigure(rb1,variable=rbValue,value="apples")
tkconfigure(rb2,variable=rbValue,value="oranges")
tkgrid(tklabel(tt,text="Which do you prefer?"))
tkgrid(tklabel(tt,text="Apples "),rb1)
tkgrid(tklabel(tt,text="Oranges "),rb2)

OnOK <- function()
{
    rbVal <- as.character(tclvalue(rbValue))
    tkdestroy(tt)
    if (rbVal=="apples")
    tkmessageBox(message="Good choice!  An apple a day keeps the doctor away!")
    if (rbVal=="oranges")
    tkmessageBox(message="Good choice!  Oranges are full of Vitamin C!")
}
OK.but <- tkbutton(tt,text="OK",command=OnOK)
tkgrid(OK.but)
tkfocus(tt)

I'm predicting that you cannot get that file to do anything interesting with Rscript, so I don't understand why you think that you can use an Rscript-ing strategy within Automator.

Hi,

I just have used that to provide an example what I am onto. My actual
code is something else and kind of personal nature since some
proprietary data are there. However essentially they are same.

What I am intending to do is, there will be some .app file which maps
that R code. Once user run that .app file by double clicking it, some
pop up will open and user shall provide further customized inputs. And
resultingly the final calculated data in csv file will be saved in
hard disk. In this way, user wont need to open R window, copy paste
the R code to do same calculation. So to me, this .app approach looks
more neat and simple from user's perspective.

Thanks,
