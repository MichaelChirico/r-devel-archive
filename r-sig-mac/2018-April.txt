Luis,

first, you seem to be using Homebrew R so you're pretty much on your own (=ask the Homebrew maintainer) since we don't support that. (In official R you do NOT want to use sudo as Jeff pointed out)

That said, you can try the latest rJava 0.9-10 version (see http://rforge.net/rJava ) which is trying to work around the issue of Java 10 lacking javah and provide feedback.
There are more macOS changes in the making to work around other Oracle issues so once the full batch is through I'd expect a CRAN release.

Cheers,
Simon

Hey Simon! 

Thanks a lot for the really quick update. I installed the package from source and now works perfectly, builds and can be use in R with other packages, like xlsx. 

I configured java without invoking root privileges. 

I know that the Homebrew users are more or less in our own, but I think there is nothing wrong in ask since probably the problem isn?t cause by the Homebrew install. Finally, Homebrew is just a way to install R from source. 

Anyhow, thanks a lot for your help! 

Best Regards
Luis Puerto

Great, thanks - I think I'll push the new version out pretty soon.

Yes, sure, but there used to be issues with the Homebrew toolchain that caused a lot of trouble that didn't exist in the official R so all I'm saying is that your mileage may vary. I think the situation is improving as more people familiar with R are entering the HB community, but it used to be pretty bad hence my disclaimer :).

Thanks,
Simon

Thanks, Vince, I have updated the builds from R-devel to R-3.5-branch but not the website sync - should be fixed and up now.

Message-ID: <B3BB8506-96DE-4FDA-95E5-B5D9D3342349@me.com>

Hi All,

Last month:

  https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-mac/2018-March/012691.html

there was a report that the SHA-1 hash of the R-3.4.4.pkg, as listed on CRAN, was not correct, even though the MD5 hash and the digital signature appeared to be correct.

The same phenomenon is the case with R-3.5.0.pkg.

The MD5 hash on CRAN is:

MD5-hash: 414029c9c9f706d3d04baa887ccffbc4 

and I get:

md5 R-3.5.0.pkg
MD5 (R-3.5.0.pkg) = 414029c9c9f706d3d04baa887ccffbc4

from the CLI on my Mac.

However, the SHA-1 hash on CRAN is:

SHA-hash: 9f5f3365afee54d3fe3148a60c1405955916f076 

and I get:

shasum R-3.5.0.pkg
6e90d38892bb366630ae30c223a898e8af84dff7  R-3.5.0.pkg

from the CLI on my Mac.

It would seem that there is a lingering issue with the generation of the SHA-1 hash value on CRAN.

Thanks,

Marc Schwartz

Hi All:

If I remember correctly how R release numbers work,  R 3.5.0 would mean best practice would be to re-install all packages,  is this correct?  The Mac version has had a mechanism that does helps automate this process,  but I have a few questions as to how this works.  Specifically:

1.  In looking for packages to re-install, does it look just in the /LIbrary/Frameworks/R location for packages,  or does it look in ~/username/Library/R also?

2.  If it does look at both locations,  does the re-install then put everything into  /LIbrary/Frameworks/R or is present location maintained?

I ask because I have a lot of packages in ~/username/Library/R and want to maintain things that way, so I want to be certain that I know what will happen fi I use the built-in mechanism.

Thanks,

-Roy

Roy,

first, I'd recommend holding off with updating packages. Due to the number of packages, updating all of them takes quite some time, so in order to use the binaries that are built with the release version of R it will probably take at least until tomorrow that they are propagated through the mirror network. Hence you'll have to re-install them anyway if you do it now. 

That said, the "select packages from previous version" search function only applies to the system library - the use library is not in scope. However, where you install those packages is up to you depending on the selection in the Package Installer - the two steps are separate in the GUI.

Cheers,
Simon

Hi Simon:

Perfect,  thank you for the info.  One of the reasons I was asking is in ~/Library/R i have a umber of packages that in fact are in CRAN but what I have are the development versions.  Everything I have in /Library/Frameworks/R are the CRAN versions.  It is easier for me to do the ~/Library//R update myself through a script so I keep the development versions.

Mostly also thanks for all of your work on the Mac version.  Much appreciated.

-Roy

Marc,

thanks, the issue is:

hagal:R-3.5.0$ openssl sha R-3.5.0-el-capitan-signed.pkg
SHA(R-3.5.0-el-capitan-signed.pkg)= 9f5f3365afee54d3fe3148a60c1405955916f076

hagal:R-3.5.0$ openssl sha1 R-3.5.0-el-capitan-signed.pkg
SHA1(R-3.5.0-el-capitan-signed.pkg)= 6e90d38892bb366630ae30c223a898e8af84dff7

so either we change the label to SHA (or SHA-0?) or change the checksum. In the root we actually provide both, even if that may or may not be relevant. For now I did the latter in the index.html.

Cheers,
Simon

Hi Simon,

Thanks for the explanation.

It did not occur to me that SHA-0 was being used, since it was withdrawn as a standard circa early 90's, after significant flaws were identified.

Apple (and others) either have or are moving away from SHA-1 to SHA-2, at least for TLS/PKI security:

  https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207459 <https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207459>

recognizing the differences between session specific TLS/PKI trust uses and longer term file integrity checking. I know Linus is more "relaxed" regarding SHA-1 and the implications for Git, or at least was last year, albeit indicating a path away from it in time.

I guess the question boils down to, if we are going to provide hashes of the files under the premise that it should offer a high level of comfort to useRs that the file has not been modified/replaced since generation, presuming that the published hash value itself was not altered, I would put forth for further discussion, moving to SHA-2 and away from both MD5 and SHA-1 (certainly moving away from SHA-0), depending upon a more broad assessment of the implications of doing so.

Thanks!

Marc

Marc,

no, the hashes merely a legacy to check that you don't have a corrupted download. They are neither intended nor used for validation. To verify the validity you should use the signature check.

Cheers,
Simon

Hi Simon,

Understood, as the digital signature is superior to the stand alone hash value, since like the hash value, it provides a check against file modifications/corruption since being signed, and unlike the stand alone hash value, it provides source validation and non-repudiation.

In either case, I see that you have now changed the labeling of the SHA hash on CRAN, to indicate that it is SHA-1 specifically, and that hash value now checks locally. Thank you for making that change.

I wonder if it might make sense, given that the signature is superior to the stand alone hash values, to begin to drop the latter for signed PKG files intended for ongoing (non-legacy) binary versions of R for macOS, for the reasons below.

If so, it might make sense to also move in the same direction for the signed PKG files in the macOS tools folder on CRAN, which now just have the MD5 hash values.

Thanks again Simon.

Marc

When I open a plot() window on-screen, it appears in the lower left corner of the screen.  
Is it possible to control the location?  If so, what commands?  
And, if so, can I locate it to a display other than the primary display?

Dennis,

unfortunately, the Quartz windows are always placed at the same coordinates 100 x 100 and there is no option to change that.

However, you can move it around using the Cocoa package if you so desire (assuming you're in the R.app):

install.packages("Cocoa",,"http://rforge.net")

library(Cocoa)

## create a quartz device and get its window
## make sure you run the following as one command or else you'll get the console window instead
quartz(); w = .M(.M("NSApplication", "sharedApplication"), "keyWindow")

## move the window:
.M(w, "setFrameTopLeftPoint:", NSMakePoint(100, 1000))


You can move it anywhere on any screen - also off-screen.

The other alternative is to move it using AppleScript.

Cheers,
Simon

The Cocoa suggestion should address my need ? thanks so much.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] command line buffer retains CR
Message-ID: <3987E9C6-C0D3-46C0-814F-65D2783803BC@quantitativebrokers.com>

I have had a minor but annoying problem with the Mac GUI that started with R version 3.4.3. I am using latest versions of everything:  R 3.4.4, MacOS High Sierra 10.13.4, all packages fully updated, etc.

The command line history retains the carriage return at the end of the line. Since you have to enter a new carriage return to send the command, the stored command lengthens by one return every time you repeat it. So your key pattern has to be Ctrl-p or up-arrow to repeat the command, immediately followed by Delete to remove the final carriage return, followed by editing of the line if that is what you want.

As I say, minor but annoying, and this behavior started with R 3.4.3 and persisted in R 3.4.4. As best as I recall, nothing changed in the OS around then so it seems to be an R issue. I would be very grateful for suggestions of how to mitigate it, or if there is any proposed fix.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] RQDA/RGtk2 Installation Problem
Message-ID: <CAGJtK3T3yY8mQM6cUdPFx6fHkEvfk9eQV8_JWE7M88NdgBU40A@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings,

I have been having a problem installing RQDA on my Mac (OS 10.13.2). I
followed the installation process on the RQDA page (http://rqda.r-forge.r-
project.org/), but I keep getting an error message saying that I am missing
pkg-config and GTK. I reinstalled XQuartz and GTK+ 2.24.17 multiple times
(and reinstalled R version 3.4.4), but kept receiving the same error
message.

Some kind person suggested this page as a possible solution:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19645590/running-
rattle-on-mac-os-x-10-9-mavericks/19719518#19719518

I am stuck after "brew install gtk+ cairo." I have very little knowledge of
coding, and unsure how to create or modify  ~/.R/Makevars....

My apologies for a noob question, but would appreciate if you could walk me
through, or point me to a step-by-step tutorial, if it is available. I have
already installed XCode and Command Line Tools.

Thank you in advance for your help.

Ryoko

This problem has continued to haunt me through more recent version of macos 
and R. My understanding from doing research is that this is something that 
Apple broke, but the problem is very disruptive when trying to debug longer 
scripts. Have you found any work-arounds other than the clear console 
solution?

I'd also be willing to contribute to a fix for this problem if there is a 
viable way forward.
