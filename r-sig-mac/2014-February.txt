This is an R-sig-mac issue, so Cc:ed there.

I have seen this after an upgrade to Mavericks: you have a partial 
installation of the pre-Mavericks Xcode Command Line Tools after the 
upgrade (which removed some of it).

See the current R-admin manual for how to use the CRAN binary of R 3.0.2 
with Mavericks.  Or get R_patched from r.research.att.com, which will 
change the compiler specs for you.

Roger does not seem to have a working Fortran compiler which is required for lme4. He may want to install one, e.g. from
http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools/

BTW: please don't point people to obsolete SO posts - the proper cure to most Mavericks problems is to simply install more recent build of R.

Cheers,
Simon

Thank you!  Installing gfortran-4.2.3.pkg fixed things.  FWIW, it was indeed the most recent build of R that I had installed.

So that I (and perhaps other list members) understand the issues more completely: one thing that was very confounding to me is that installing gcc49 via MacPorts *does* provide a Fortran compiler, which goes in /opt/local/bin/gfortran.  However, I couldn?t figure out how to get R to use this compiler.  Perhaps this requires properly setting variables in ~/.R/Makevars, but I couldn?t figure out what the proper settings would be.  Do you have any guidance on this?

Best & thanks once more.

Roger

The CRAN build is a native build of R and only supports native compilers. If you use MacPorts you're entirely on your own - you may want to use MacPorts R in that case or compile everything from sources accordingly.

Yes, I know about <SHIFT>-<CTRL>-B but that's ugly-ish.

What I'd like to request is a automatic paired-bracket color 
highlighting in a manner similar to what Notepad++ does (which, if you 
haven't used it, colors a bracket next to the cursor and its matching 
pair).  While it's nice to get that quickie highlighting while typing a 
line of code, in general it's a lot more useful to get a highlighting 
while eding code blocks.

Just a request -- I can live without it :-)
Carl

Just to understand - we do already highlight the matching bracket when you move the cursor over/next to a bracket/paren. So is your suggestion to make that highlighting longer/permanent as opposed to flashing?

Thanks,
Simon

Well, actually,   on R 3.0.2 GUI 1.62 Snow Leopard build (6558) I don't
get any response to a hovering pointer!  I get a very brief highlight if 
I pass the cursor "across" a bracket using the arrow keys.  If I move 
the mouse pointer and click at a location to place the cursor there, no 
highlighting.

But, yes,  what I'm requesting is for the bracket pair to stay 
highlighted as long as the cursor (not the mouse pointer) is situated 
next to a bracket.

ciao,
Carl

	install
Message-ID: <7F21F857-C0AD-4BB7-ABB3-52229F243580@colorado.edu>

Hello,

I am on Mac OS X Version 10.8.5. I recently installed R-3.0.2.pkg on my machine which by default put the R application in my /Applications folder. When I envoke R by double clicking on the R application file in my Applications folder it opens up a GUI just fine. However, when I try to invoke R from a terminal window I get the error "-bash: R64: command not found." This appears to be unrelated to R not being in my path. /Applications is in my path and when I cd to the /Applications folder and try and invoke R by typing "R" or "R --help" I get the same "command not found" error. I read in the R installation and Administration manual that "A version of R can be run directly from the command-line as e.g. /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.0/Resources/bin/R). However when I cd to this directory and type "R" I get the same "command not found" error again. It also does not appear related to R not being executable. The R installation in my /Applications folder looks like this with ls -l:

drwxrwxr-x    3 root      admin            102 Feb 12 05:20 R.app

Any advice?

Thanks,
Cathy

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Homebrew R, brewed gettext and --with-libintl-prefix
Message-ID: <20140224203056.GD990@gmail.com>

Hi list,

This is probably the wrong place to post this, but I've hit an issue with the
homebrewed version of R. See:
https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-science/pull/676

It looks like the --with-libintl-prefix configure option is not adding the
proper include directory when installing packages. Is explicitly exporting
CPPFLAGS the proper way to get packages to use a non-standard gettext
installation or should --with-libintl-prefix do this automatically?

The alternative of using the included gettext also works, but homebrew already
packages gettext:
https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-science/pull/674

Any comments/suggestsions either on the list or on github would be appreciated.

Thanks

So?  At least it includes a 32-bit compiler (by default if I understand 
the version you are using).

You need to specify a 32-bit compiler.  AFAIK -arch is specific to Apple 
front-ends, and the value is i386, not x686.

If you build multilib GCC from the sources, the flag needed is -m32.

This *is* all in the relevant manual.

At the very least have a broken haxxie installed. I would strongly suggest removing ~/Library/InputManagers (or at least move it aside) since those haxxies get loaded into every application and major cause of crashes (see also Mac FAQ 12.4). Removing that problem may either solve the issue or unmask some other problem. In the latter case, please scan through the Mac FAQ to find a solution, otherwise post here with details.

Cheers,
Simon

Hi,

I think

brew link --force gettext

is also a viable workaround ... when not being afraid of the wolves
(This pushes the keg only homebrew provided gettext version closer to 
the conflicts arena, but for me enabled package installation in R again)

Message-ID: <B8813096-DC75-4DB3-8016-3B6AB98A8FD4@imperial.ac.uk>

Hi All,

I recently moved from OS 10.8.5 to 10.9.2.  So far so good.  After years of using Macports (without any issues) I decided on a whim to give Homebrew a try.  Before installing Homebrew I had installed R-3.0-branch-snowleopard-signed.pkg from http://r.research.att.com.

Using brew doctor tell me that:

brew doctor
Warning: Unbrewed dylibs were found in /usr/local/lib.
If you didn't put them there on purpose they could cause problems when
building Homebrew formulae, and may need to be deleted.

Unexpected dylibs:
    /usr/local/lib/libtcl8.6.dylib
    /usr/local/lib/libtk8.6.dylib

Warning: Unbrewed .pc files were found in /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig.
If you didn't put them there on purpose they could cause problems when
building Homebrew formulae, and may need to be deleted.

Unexpected .pc files:
    /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/tcl.pc
    /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/tk.pc

Warning: Unbrewed static libraries were found in /usr/local/lib.
If you didn't put them there on purpose they could cause problems when
building Homebrew formulae, and may need to be deleted.

Unexpected static libraries:
    /usr/local/lib/libtclstub8.6.a
    /usr/local/lib/libtkstub8.6.a

pkgutil identifies these files as coming from the R pkg.  Can I safely ignore the whining of brew doctor or not (I like R.app and I?d rather keep it)?  I plan to use home-brew to install gcc, gsl, ffmpeg, and scipy (for python 3).  I would say I do not envision conflicts and bugs but I?d rather ask first.

BW

F


PS  I also asked on apple stack, but I haven?t go any reasonable answer thus far and I?d rather get going.

I plan to use home-brew to install gcc, gsl, ffmpeg, and scipy (for python 3).  I would say I do not envision conflicts and bugs but I?d rather ask first.

Unfortunately HB installs by default in /usr/local and requires full control so you cannot have native libraries and HB in the same place at the same time. So essentially you have to pick one or the other. There are two options:

a) install HB in another place. This allows you to keep native libraries in /usr/local and parallel HB. HB is less tested that way, though, so that's why HB is shy of recommending it.

b) ignore HB's moaning. It should be ok as long as you don't install tcl/tk via HB. It may get complicated if dependencies detect tcl/tk so for safety you could rename the .pc files and the t*Config.sh files if you don't expect to compile R packages that depend on tcl/tk.

Cheers,
Simon

I am ignoring the moanings of brew doctor.  I generally try and avoid compiling R packages if at all possible, and I never used stuff that uses tcl/tk (that I know of).  My main concern is that I want to install SciPy and Python 3 (assuming this can be done in a way that will not get Mavericks throw a fit) and that might ? or not ? get some tcl/tk action in.  If not, R.app and HB can live together for all I care.

Best

F

It would be more convenient to use the environment variables, e.g. for 
Fedora I use

setenv RMPI_INCLUDE /usr/include/openmpi-x86_64
setenv RMPI_LIB_PATH /usr/lib64/openmpi/lib
setenv RMPI_TYPE OPENMPI

And 'brew' was not mentioned: you would need to install *that* first. 
But it is unnecessary: openmpi builds out of the box using the compilers 
used for R and needs no customizations.

In view of another thread today, does that clobber other compilers in 
/usr/local?

Please do read the posting guide and what it says about that.
