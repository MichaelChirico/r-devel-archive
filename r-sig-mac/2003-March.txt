Message-ID: <D762EC23-4DBB-11D7-88C5-000393BB6D36@stat.ucla.edu>

Cross platform GUI toolkits for OS X // Python // R

Qt (no from R)
	Qt (X11) in fink
	QtMac (Carbon) commercial
	
wxWindows (no from R)
	wxGTK (X11) in fink
	wxMac (Carbon) http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/wxpython
	wxCocoa (on its way to CVS)

tk (yes from R)
	tk (X11) in fink
	AquaTk (Carbon)

GTK (yes from R)
	GTK+ (X11) in fink
	GTK-OSX (Carbon) http://gtk-osx.sourceforge.net/
	GTK-Quartz (Cocoa) http://gtk-quartz.sourceforge.net/ (dead ?)
	
fltk (no from R)
	fltk (X11) from fink
	fltk (Carbon) from CVS http://www.fltk.org/software.php?SOFTWARE=v2_0
	
Of course X11/Xlib programming is possible in OS X, as is Motif
programming (lesstif and openmotif are in fink). But this is too
low-level to classify as a toolkit. And Carbon and Cocoa programming
is obviously possible, but that's not cross-platform. Interfaces to all  
these
toolkits are available from Python, which mean you can use Rpy to mix
toolkit and R programming.

R-1.6.2 has been updated to the lastest patched version, with recent 
CRAN
package updates. The huge R-python package has been split into a number
of separate downloads, which consist of the R-part (with add-on 
packages),
the Python-part (with add-ons as well), the wxPython/wxWindows part,
and the tcl/tk part (used by both Python and R). The R-devel version now
uses both vecLib.framework for BLAS/Lapack and AquaTk for Tcl/Tk.
The new Carbon Emacs build includes ESS, yet another Carbon based
GUI.

Hi

I want to install R on MacOS X 10.2.4. For this I downloaded the 
Carbon-version 1.6.2. It runs without problem (just starting the 
R-application).
For a script I have to install the chron package. I downloaded it and 
copied it into the library folder. Executing library() the 
chron-package is also listed.
Typing library(chron) I get the error:  Error in 
testRversion(descFile): This package has not been installed properly. 
See the note in ?library.

I tried install.packages() and got "Couldn't find function 
'install.packages'"

Then I downloaded the "Darwin-version" 1.5.1 and installed the 
packages. But when I start R in the terminal, I get messages about 
missing libraries. I read you should install Fink in this case which I 
did but it still doesn't run - I get library-version errors.

I also couldn't manage to compile R (Developer tools are installed)

Can anybody help me? How can I install a package correctly in the 
carbon version?
or how do I have do install/compile R for Unix?

Thanks
Markus

Markus,

Boy, did I go through a lot of frustration in trying to get this to work!
I never was able to get the Carbon version of R to work in ways that I
wanted. So I posted to the R list. In so doing, I received some great
advice from Andrew Beckerman and Stefano. Below is what Andrew said to get
the Unix version running.

Viel Glueck!

Rick
=====================================================
As for packages... this is got to be the one reason to move to the Unix
version.  With the unix version you can a)install R with all "known"
packages (~250), compiled by Jan de Leeuw at UCLA or b) you can get the
base system and use R's commands to install packages... its really
quite easy once you get there and have R up and running...

download the .tar pacakge to your home directory.  Start X11 or just
the terminal.  type sudo R COMMAND INSTALL package name... type in your
password... the rest is done!! that easy.

(Using the terminal is fine to run R, but no graphics can be seen...
getting X11 up and running is a great bit of fun and the access to
other software is fantastic - GIMP is the open source version of
photoshop and there are open source Matlabs and the like as well...
anyhow... off the stump now.)

Go here first...it is a good description of installing X11and Fink and
stuff... the most gentle I have found. Once this is done... getting R
installed is "easy".

Dear all
Since I am really a bloody beginner in R I downloaded 2 version for mac os X.
One rm162 works fine

The other one..  is 5 times larger called R-1.5.1 and should also be 
running with X11.
If I am installing this verison on a drive w/o OS it produces more 
files also called local/bin/R...
how can I start this version?

If I am installing it on the Drive with OS X 10.2 it only makes 
dynamic librarys.
How can I start R from this drive? in the terminal or in the X11 environement?

thanks. jg

Hi,

I have:

   ibook G3
   Mac OS 10.2.4
  

I have installed:

   x11  0.2.1 from Apple          installed first
   R    1.6.2 binaries from gifi  installed second
   fink 0.5.1 from sourceforge    installed third


I followed Jan's instructions at gifi:
"Once you have fink setup, also reinstall the libraries included here."
That is, I first moved my /sw to /sw_old, then installed fink,
then if any dylibs in /sw_old/lib that were missing from /sw/lib,
I moved them to /sw/lib .

However, R is still missing a dylib. Watch:

***** START QUOTE FROM SESSION *****

[plastic:~] davidpea% R
dyld: /usr/local/lib/R/bin/R.bin version mismatch for library: 
/usr/lib/libncurses.5.dylib (compatibility version of user: 
6.0.0 greater than library's version: 5.0.0)
Trace/BPT trap

***** END QUOTE FROM SESSION *****

In /sw/lib, I have the following dylibs (including links):

lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  admin      20 Mar  4 09:39 libcurses.dylib -> libncurses.dylib.5.2
-rwxr-xr-x  1 root  admin  492256 Jan 18 18:06 libncurses++.a
-rw-r--r--  1 root  admin  617424 Jan 18 18:05 libncurses.a
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  admin      18 Mar  4 09:39 libncurses.dylib -> libncurses.dylib.5
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  admin      20 Mar  4 09:39 libncurses.dylib.5 -> libncurses.dylib.5.2
-rw-r--r--  1 root  admin  360092 Jan 18 18:05 libncurses.dylib.5.2

I see that libncurses.dylib version 6 is missing.

Jan says this at gifi:

"You should also install the Apple version of X11, and then if R
complains about missing libraries you should install them using fink"


Well, here's my question (sorry if I'm being stupid!):

How do I install the correct libncurses dylib using fink?


Many of the questions on this list are about dylibs. I guess
many of us do not understand what they are and what they do
(I certainly don't understand). Perhaps someone on this list
could send a URL or other citation to a tutorial on dylibs?
Or provide a quick overview themselves?


Thanks!

David Pearson, in England.

I apologize with all the people who incorrectly downloaded the of R 
1.5.1 binaries from CRAN.
They have now been removed. If you are not able to build R yourself, 
please download the binaries that Jan de Leeuw kindly builds at every 
release.

Just installed R (1.6.2 and 1.7.0-pre) on my powerbook. Not sure if 
there is
a FAQ list, but I have troubles configuring help.start().

Right now I have specified:

That does not work well (it does start a browser, Safari, Netscape
or IE, dependent on the browser string), but does not respond to
say help(diag) after help.start().

Thanks,
Rob

I have a script /usr/local/bin/netscape which contains

#!/bin/sh
open -a Safari /usr/local/lib/R/doc/html/index.html

No need to do anything with options(), just uses the
default.

But you are right, help(diag) then just opens another browser window
with the same index.html. I will try dillo, galeon, and mozilla for
gtk, which are all in fink (just link them to /usr/local/bin/netscape).

Install mozilla from fink, then make a soft-link

ln -s /sw/bin/mozilla /usr/local/bin/netscape

or set options(browser="/sw/bin/mozilla").

Now help.start() opens this mozilla and help(diag)
works as advertised.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac]Problems building the current R-devel on 10.2.4
Message-ID: <2B0F119A-5295-11D7-926E-000393B552A2@bigpond.com>

Over the last few weeks changes to the R-devel have lead to failed  
compiles
for me of the R-devel (rsync) tree. My last successful build was early  
Feb 2003.

I am using 10.2.4 and the latest apple development tools and the latest  
fink cvs libraries but not ATLAS as I'm trying to use vecLib. I'm on an  
700MHz ibook.

I get warnings about the MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET which seems
to indicate a change in the default behavior b/n 10.1 and 10.2.

I also get an error during the compile about MH_DYLIB and multi module  
and the libg2c.a library from the fink g77. The error is the same as in  
the post  
https://www.stat.math.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-mac/2003-February/ 
000776.html . I did rebuild the fink g77 from cvs as advised without  
any change in the error message.

Module methods also warns of prior library references b/n bundle loader  
R.bin and the libR.

What is the recommended configure options for building on macos 10.2.4.

I'm currently using :

./configure   
--with-tcl-config=/Library/Frameworks/Tcl.framework/tclConfig.sh \
--with-tk-config=/Library/Frameworks/Tk.framework/tkConfig.sh \
--enable-R-shlib  --with-aqua --with-x\
--with-blas="-framework vecLib" --with-lapack \
TCLTK_LIBS="-framework Tcl -framework Tk" \
TCLTK_CPPFLAGS="-framework Tcl -framework Tk"  \
CPPFLAGS="-I/sw/include" LDFLAGS="-L/sw/lib"

Any thoughts to
1. Is this the right config?
2. What should I define the MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET as?
3. I note that the linker now defaults to twolevel_namespace by  
default, does
	this require any adjustments?

Regards Tom

This is no problem.

Are you sure you have the g77 from the unstable tree of fink ?

We are working on getting rid of some of the warnings.

Get rid of --with-aqua, since it does not work anyway and will be  
removed soon.

It is now 10.1, if you make it 10.2 you will see that fink's g77 does  
not work
anymore.

We are working on that, but it does not for me.

Dear readers,
do you have any experiences with R on older PowerMacs? Given the system
requirements in the FAQ, it should run even on Macs with PPC601 processor.
Is it possible to handle data matrices of say 1000 x 10 (observations x
variables) on a PPC603 200 MHz machine? Where lie bottlenecks if there
are any?
Thank you,

Greetings:

I have been trying to install ggobi with the ultimate goal of using it 
within R. I am having difficulty which appears to be related to gcc not 
allowing -shared as an option with Mac OS X. Can anyone suggest how I 
can overcome this problem?

I am using a 15" flat-panel iMac, Mac OSX 10.2.4, Apple's X11 beta 3.

The gory details of the attempted installation follow:

I downloaded ggobi, ggobi_0.99-10.tar.gz and gunzipped and tarred it as 
su to get the directory /usr/local/lib/ggobi and within that directory 
I did

sudo ./configure --with-xml --enable-embed

and got:

Now when I

sudo make

I got

It appears that gcc does not like the -shared option. And indeed in the 
help file for gcc it says that this option is not allowed for Mac OS X.

In MacOS X you can build either dynamic libraries (foo.dylib), which are
to be linked against, or bundles (foo.so) which are to be loaded at run
time (plugins, packages). Most ELF based systems dont distinguish the
two.

So in R, for instance, you make libR.dylib and R_gnome.so or tcltk.so.
For dylibs you need the flag -dynamiclib, for bundles you need -bundle
(but more, because you need to tell the linker what to do about 
undefined
symbols). See the configure files for R for more details.

I'll look at ggobi, which I have running, but I am not sure what I

I have been meaning to add this to the GGobi configuration, and will
get to it now that I know there is at least a small level of interest.
For the moment, you can run configure and then edit Makeconf and edit
the value of SHLIB_LDFLAGS. We parameterized it because we knew this
would arise, just never got to putting all the pieces together.

Also, just as a pointer for simplicity, if you untar the ggobi 
distribution and then from within the top-level directory
untar Rggobi, you could install both in one step as

  ./configure --with-R

Of course, we'll have to fix the configuration to get the -shared flag right.

And compiles, and passes make check. I will continue to experiment
with two-level namespaces (and perhaps with weak linking) but in
a private copy only.

I looked around in the Makeconf file in R and found

SHLIB_LDFLAGS= -bundle -flat_namespace -undefined suppress

I edited the Makeconf that was created when ggobi was configured and 
replaced -shared with the above. The error I got was

  tour_pp.c:31: header file 'malloc.h' not found

Does this have anything to do with the revised flags? Any suggestions 
on how to proceed?

Thanks!

There is no malloc.h in OS X. All the defs are in stdlib.h. If you want  
to
you could make a softlink /usr/local/inlcude/malloc.h to   
/usr/include/stdlib.h,
or even make a dummy empty malloc.h.

There is hopefully a file named README.OSX in the distribution
that provides some (few) hints about compiling on OSX. It may not
get added to the tar file when I build the distribution.
You can find it at 
  http://www.ggobi.org/README.OSX

Anyway, in there, I suggest just creating malloc.h locally
within  the GGobi source files as an empty file.

Thanks very much for your help. I am getting further along in the 
process with your help and the readme link. However, I don't know what 
to do about the values.h missing. In the README.OSX file it says:

The inclusion of values.h in utils.c causes problems also.
We can conditionally include this with the pre-processor
symbol
   -DNO_VALUES_H

How do I use this symbol?

Thanks again!

Good question; my notes in README.OSX were more notes to me than
instructions for others! Sorry about that.

You can typically include -DNO_VALUES_H in the value of CFLAGS which
is used when compiling the .o from a .c file.  Until I fix the
configuration to deal with the Mac, you might add this to PIC_CFLAG in
the Makeconf (or Makeconf.in).

Thanks for your patience. I do hope to get to all of this later in the
week (i.e. tomorrow or Friday) as I also am dealing with plugins on
Windows for GGobi. So it is all related!

Message-ID: <A108394E-5BF0-11D7-9012-000393BB6D36@stat.ucla.edu>


John Novembre points out that x11() does not work if you run R in Carbon
Emacs from gifi. But x11(display=":0") does work (and after that x11()
works as well).

He also points out that "emacs -nw" from the command line, using
the emacs in /usr/local/bin, does not work, because  
/usr/local/libexec/emacs is
missing.

I have put that directory on gifi in the emacs section. Unpack in / as  
usual.

This version compiles and runs fine on Darwin 6.5 (OS X 10.2.5).

If I am using the native Tcl/Tk and BLAS/LAPACK in vecLib,
my configure sequence is

configure  
--with-tcl-config=/Library/Frameworks/Tcl.framework/tclConfig.sh  
--with-tk-config=/Library/Frameworks/Tk.framework/tkConfig.sh  
--enable-R-shlib --without-x --with-blas='-framework vecLib'  
--with-lapack TCLTK_LIBS='-framework Tcl -framework Tk'  
TCLTK_CPPFLAGS='-I/Library/Frameworks/Tcl.Framework/Headers  
-I/Library/Frameworks/Tk.Framework/Headers'

while the more standard version, using Apple's X11 and fink's gnome, is

configure --with-tcl-config=/sw/lib/tclConfig.sh  
--with-tk-config=/sw/lib/tkConfig.sh --enable-R-shlib --with-gnome  
--with-blas='-framework vecLib' --with-lapack

	If you're well and truly bored you might want to play with this...
Message-ID: <6C1739E9-6036-11D7-A399-000393BDE1EC@hsph.harvard.edu>

Hi folks, as I was recently stuck on a plane from Boston to LA I 
finally got started coding a Mathematica/Maple-style notebook interface 
for R... I made several abortive attempts on the Windows platform and 
finally got a technology test working under Cocoa during the flight 
(and the last couple of days).  You can play with a copy here: 
http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~bcellis/StatPaper.app.tar.gz

Mostly it serves me as a cool toy that makes relatively deep use of the 
Cocoa APIs. It also helps me think about using R as a "kernel." Like, 
what happens when I have two documents? How do I get graphics out 
without having to resort to an intermediate file? (Oh how I wish 
devices could take a connection... then I could just pipe the PDF 
output directly to an NSImage and be done with it... but I should 
probably find a less hackish solution. Suggestions willing accepted :-))

Just decompress it. And it should run fine (at least it did under 
10.2.4 :-))
As its a tech test is comes with a set of caveats as long as my arm 
(including, but not limited to):
	* Assumes you have R installed in the usual place (/usr/local/lib/R). 
I'm using Jan's build of 1.6.2. It doesn't embed or anything (it 
employs --slave, sort of) so as long as you can execute R it should 
actually load the engine. There will be approximately 0 helpful error 
messages if it doesn't load.
	* You can't save or load documents
	* Opening a second document might cause your computer to explode. It 
will definitely cause strange things to happen
	  as it only uses a single (global) R session for computation. I'm not 
sure how to work around this.
	* You can only execute the entire document at once. The code to 
execute a single block is pretty trivial, I just haven't hooked it up 
to the WindowController
             yet
	* trying to use graphics will probably result in horrific explosions. 
Obviously inline graphics are a high priority, but as mentioned above, 
I'm not sure how it would be done.
	* I'm not particularly fond of the name... but the project had to be 
called -something-.
	* Its a tech test, I'd be more surprised if it works than if it 
doesn't :-)

Just sort of tossing it out there since there seems to be a good deal 
of GUI development focused on more abstract Stata/Spreadsheet-like 
interfaces rather than more document-like interfaces. At the very least 
its the beginning of a nearly WYSIWYG vignette editor :-)

Funky. There is a way to get graphics from StatPaper. Just type

quartz()
demo(graphics)

and evaluate the document. Unfortunately the graphics window
does not respond to events. My guess is that for this to work,
R should sit in StatPaper, or should be part of a framework
build.

The quartz device never responds to events. It isn't finished yet.

Another way is with
   x11(display=":0")
if you download Apple's X server (which is now just point-and-click).

It is not true that the quartz device never responds to events. If
I run R using Rpy in PythonIDE or IDLE, it does respond (I can
drag it, bring it to the foreground, minimize it, close it).

The quartz() device is finished and it works fine with the carbon 
version of R.
The problem is that it is not integrated with the event loop on the 
darwin port.

Yeah, since R is running out-of-process (via an NSTask) it should let  
you do out-of-line graphics (you could even use REventLoop or Tk or  
whatever as well). Having a framework build of R (a la Python) would be  
sort of cool, though I don't know how much it would be used unless R  
were to towards always being embedded (the normal CLI and R Carbon  
interfaces just being other instances of an embedding application). It  
looks like things are moving in that direction from the codebase. On  
the other hand there is something appealing about having the "kernel"  
type of structure (with R running as a separate process) as it  
potentially lets you execute code on, say, the large server in the  
basement from your laptop...

Anyways, I'm glad people are checking it out and that it hasn't set  
anything on fire yet :-)

Check if R-1.6.2 runs on a G3. But even that is compiled with an  
Altivec and dual processor sensitive ATLAS.
