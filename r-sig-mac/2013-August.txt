Those files would both be invisible when using the Finder.app unless you used ls in a terminal session, but I guess you figured that out

In 2008 it was reported in the NEWS for R 2.7.1 that:

http://markmail.org/search/?q=list%3Aorg.r-project.r-help+DS_Store#query:list%3Aorg.r-project.r-help%20DS_Store+page:1+mid:cx3hryqssis2slx7+state:results

o R CMD build tries harder to clean up the inst/doc directory from the remnants of earlier builds.

It also removes any directories with extension .Rcheck, and files .DS_Store and ._* (created by tar on Mac OS X under some circumstances: it now sets environment variables to ask for such files not to be created by that tar.)

So we need to ask if this was just a warning message. It appears that there are mechanisms in place to remove those files.

(It's arguably an R-devel topic.)

invisible *by default*: it is a Finder setting.

It seems the OP did not use R CMD build, rather R CMD check.

But files like man/.Rapp.history will need to be removed manually.

They're trying their damndest to hide it, though. It's only settable by "defaults write ..." in a Terminal. (And if you know how to do that, you might as well be using "ls".)

You can do it with rm in a terminal, but as I understand it, .DS_store files are created _by_ Finder, so it is a bit of a fight against windmills. It'll be there again next time you view the directory. 

The key is to do what Kasper said. Exactly what he said, not what you think he meant to say! I.e., 

 R CMD build pkgName
 R CMD check pkgName_X_Y_Z.tar.gz

I.e., do not install, build and run check on the .tar.gz file. R CMD build should take care of skipping the .DS_store files.

You should be running R CMD check on the package *tarball*, not on the source folder tree. So:

  R CMD check pkgName_X.1.tar.gz

or perhaps:

  R CMD check --as-cran pkgName_X.1.tar.gz

after running:

  R CMD build pkgName

to create the source tarball.

The output regarding the .DS_Store files is a NOTE regarding the package folder tree, not on the tarball contents and is not a warning or an error. Don't worry about .DS_Store or other version control system files (eg. for SVN or Git) as they will be ignored when building the package tarball, as R excludes them by default.

Other hidden files however, may be problematic, so you should avoid explicitly creating them, just as you should remove other non-essential files that may have been created by editors, GUIs, etc. that should not be part of the source package content.

More generally, don't worry about the .DS_Store files on OSX. They contain metadata that is useful for Finder and are arguably an annoyance, but that's about it. There are parallel files on other OS's as well.

Marc Schwartz

Message-ID: <8E56E638-416B-49CB-8374-1C957E2DB818@indiana.edu>

Hello,

I am trying to get a custom R package (from another group) to run on my system. If I call it from the command line r, it works fine.  If I call it from R.app, it complains with:

Error in dyn.load(file, DLLpath = DLLpath, ...) : 
  unable to load shared object '/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.0/Resources/library/ANTsR/libs/libRantsRegistration.so':
  dlopen(/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.0/Resources/library/ANTsR/libs/libRantsRegistration.so, 6): Library not loaded: libitkdouble-conversion-4.5.1.dylib
  Referenced from: /Applications/image-processing/ANTsR/src/ANTS/ANTS-build/lib/libl_antsRegistration.dylib
  Reason: image not found
Error: package or namespace load failed for ?ANTsR?

(ANTsR is the package I'm trying to get working)

I CAN get it to work by doing this on the command line first:

export DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH=/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/lib

and then also opening the R.app from the command line:

open /Applications/R.app/

However, I can't seem to get R.app to know about 
export DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH=/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/lib
unless I do it this way. 

So my questions are:

1) how can I get R.app to know about the DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH?  I tried putting it into my .Renviron file, but it doesn't work  (maybe the syntax is supposed to be different?)

2) why does r on the command line know about dynamic libraries, but R.app does not?? This seems like a bug, but maybe there is a good reason for it?

Thanks for any suggestions,

-Tom

In general, OSX GUI based apps do not inherit the shell environment. This is the case with Emacs on OSX for example.

What is the syntax that you used in .Renviron? It should be along the lines of:

  DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH=/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/lib

Note, do not use 'export' before the above. I just tried it here and it worked. 

Take a look at ?Startup for more details.

Marc Schwartz

I believe this is due to the phenomenon explained here:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/135688/setting-environment-variables-in-os-x

Look for the answer that starts with "Up to and including Lion"

Also you'll find a link to a free preference pane you can install that
lets you handle these things with a GUI (pref pane) -- I've never used
it, but you can find it here:

http://diaryproducts.net/EnvPane
https://github.com/hschmidt/EnvPane

You could also try to manually set the environment variable in your
working R session, via:

R> Sys.setenv(DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH="/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/lib")

not sure if that'll work, but easy enough to try before.

Still -- it's possible that DYLD vars won't work in this way. See this:
http://support.apple.com/kb/TS4267

Sorry -- no concrete answers here, but hopefully these things will
help you find a workable solution.

R.app is a process. R is a shell script that launches a process.  Both 
inherit the environment they are launched from, but it is usually 
different from the GUI and from a terminal.

It is regarded as a security hole to allow a running process to change 
the settings of its dynamic loader (dyld on OS X), so I would not expect 
that setting such environment variables from within R.app (including 
from reading .Renviron) to affect dyld.  So if it did for Marc, I am 
surprised and would expect that hole to be plugged in due course.

It is not 'R.app doesn't respect DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH': R.app 
knows nothing about it.  Rather, it is dyld which I would expect to read 
its environment variables only when the process is launched (and as 
Steve Lianoglou has pointed out, which plists are read before dyld is 
initialized for a process has changed over time).

This is not really the best way to extend the library search path.  In 
this case, for one package, the simplest way is to use -rpath when the 
package was installed (and I believe you can set or edit the runpath 
after the .so is made with install_name_tool).

Something similar was reported earlier this year.
See https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-mac/2013-April/010057.html
In that case the way the package was built was incorrectly.

From the error message it appears that libitkdouble-conversion-4.5.1.dylib is not found.
So if it can be found by commandline R with DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY set to /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/lib
the libitkdouble-*.dylib must have been put in that directory.

Whatever for? That's an R directory. 
Why did the install or build of /Applications/image-processing/ANTsR/src/ANTS/ANTS-build/lib/libl_antsRegistration.dylib put something in the R lib directory?

Hi all,

Just for clarification, I only set the variable in ~/.Renviron to be sure that it was picked up by R.app, in case Tom had not used the correct syntax. I did not actually install the package under discussion from the source at GitHub, so I cannot confirm that the approach resolved the issue that Tom is reporting. Tom's report would suggest that it does not.

Berend's reply would seem to support the notion that this is a problem in the way in which the package ends up being built, so would lead one down the path, I believe, of a bug in the package, perhaps in its make related files vis-a-vis the included C++ code. Thus a report to the package author would seem to be in order.

With respect to Kasper's reply, there are potential issues in resetting or unsetting DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH or DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH in that there are other applications that can depend upon their value and if altered, can break those applications. So the caution is warranted.

If Tom is on Mountain Lion, the message:

  "dyld: DYLD_ environment variables being ignored because main executable (/usr/bin/login) is setuid or setgid"

may be related to a known bug in Mountain Lion (OS X 10.8) that occurs when running sudo in a terminal session. It has been widely reported, with various attempts at resolution, including things like creating shell wrappers for sudo, but no definitive solution that lacks side effects has been put forth. Apple appears to know about the bug, since reports would suggest that it has been resolved in beta releases of Mavericks (OS X 10.9), but no official fix is yet pending for Mountain Lion. Perhaps a future update to Mountain Lion might include the fix if the Mavericks solution is stable.

If Tom is not on Mountain Lion, then the problem may yet be related in terms of the underlying etiology in setting DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH, which brings Kasper's note of caution into consideration.

Regards,

Marc

Sorry for coming in late - I was traveling - otherwise I'd hope to stop this madness earlier :)

Any reason why R for Mac FAQ 12.18 (and the proposed solutions) would not apply here?

I also agree that DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH should not be messed with and that the proper solution is to fix the libtk*dylib which has bad ID and thus gets linked incorrectly (missing path).

Cheers,
Simon

Regarding why this package requires DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH to be set to work via GUI is something that I don't understand myself, but will certainly pass on your comments to the package maintainers.

Regarding the dangers some of you see of using DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH in this way, can anyone elaborate in a way that a package user like myself can appreciate?  How exactly could it wreck my system? Given that this package is extremely useful to my research, I'm willing to chance it if it only means odd messages in the terminal. If my disk gets wiped, I might be more concerned.

Thanks for any help you can provide to enlighten me more (this has been very enlightening so far).

-Tom

I did but apparently you didn't read my answer -- just for clarification 12.18 is from
http://r.research.att.com/man/RMacOSX-FAQ.html
in 3.0 release FAQ it is under number 10.13 (unfortunately someone broke the numbering recently).

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] arguments to dev.new()
Message-ID: <52078559.2020308@witthoft.com>

Hi,
the WindowsOS - specific command "windows()"  accepts an argument 
"restoreConsole" , which, when set to TRUE, returns focus to the console 
window after opening a new graphics device.
The help file for "dev.new()"  only says '...	arguments to be passed to 
the device selected.'

Is there an argument that will return focus to the R.app console window?

thanks
Carl

Nope - you have to use <Cmd><1> (or equivalent).

In theory this would be possible to implement but it's quite tricky - Quartz is independent of the UI and the console could be in fact in another app (this is quite common: e.g. running R console in the Terminal and Quartz in the R process ).

I tried using various versions of the 'edit' command. Here is an account of
how this failed. I hope I have included all relevant information.

I haven't used R for a couple of years. Before restarting with R, I
downloaded the latest version I could find in its binary version, and
installed it without any problems.
Mac Os X Finder command "About R" responds with

Thanks for your email, which was sufficient to point me to my error.

Before your email, I had thought that if the file did not exist, then the "edit" command would create the file, since this is what happens when using editor programs under Unix. But in R is not correct, at least on my combination of OS and R.

So I first separately created a file called "nam.R" and then tried
vi(file="nam.R").
At this point R opened a new window with an editor that controlled the window and enabled one to edit "nam.R", but the editor wasn't vi and it wasn't vim. Maybe it was some standard editor provided with R.
My problem is therefore half solved. I cannot see how to invoke a true vim or vi that cooperates directly with R.
Do other Mac users experience the same feature?

I would be interested to know what happens on non-Mac Unix, Linux or Windows platforms, if anyone can spare the time and has the hardware to try it. Some R-help subscribers seem to regard it as axiomatic that no problem with R on a Mac can occur on other platforms, and I have been strongly re-directed to this list. Now perhaps I'll find out that this particular question is also not appropriate for R-SIG-MAC.

Thanks for any help.
David

I suspect that you're running the R Mac GUI (you didn't say). In that case, you're not on a shell, so obviously you cannot use shell programs like vi. If your editor is a proper OS X app (and not just a command line tool), you can set it to be the default editor in the preferences of the GUI.

However, given the reference to other unix platforms above, my guess would be that you really intended to use the command-line version of R (by typing "R" in the shell) - there all the regular unix rules apply.

Cheers,
Simon

Dear Simon
Thanks so much for explaining it all to me. Yes, I was running your GUI. i tried the command line interface to R, and, as you promised, it all worked perfectly. I had found the situation very puzzling. It also seems that R-help subscribers were, after all, right in directing me to this list. I now have a much better understanding of what is going on.
Best wishes
David

"ruby"??? "mxcl"???

What does this have to do with R? (Or for that matter, the directions referenced?) Generally Simon advises against using brew, fink, or other Mac/NIX package installers. Rmpi is not listed as available in CRAN at the moment, apparently because it took more than 30 minutes to unload:

You should do a better job of explaining your system and resources and goals of this effort.

I doubt that you need to do any of that. Certainly you need to do a better job of describing your OS, your system tools, which MPI you have installed or are intending to use, and what versions of R and Rmpi that you have. 

Also explain why you are not using the standard parallel package.

Perhaps you should offer your basis for thinking, incorrectly, that it is not available.

Hi Ema,

Can you try resenting this -- the quoting seems to have gotten messed up.

Yup, the package apparently doesn't use working flags to link against glpk. According to dependency flags it's missing -lgmp -lm -- it should probably use autoconf to detect the proper flags as glpk can be compiled with or without gmp support.

Note that this is only an issue for static libraries: if shared aka 
dynamic libraries are built correctly dependencies are pulled in.  Tha 
means that if you want to install Rglpk you can do so against a 
self-build of glpk as a shared library (and is what I have done).

Since AFAICS glpk does not provide a pkg-config file, it is hard for 
anyone other than its installer to know what is needed.

That does indicate the need to solve the missing Mac MPI package.

Sarah,

errno=13 is "permission denied" so it seems like your system's access control is somewhat misconfigured. Did you try "Repair Disk Permissions" in "Disk Utility"?

If that doesn't help please send us the output of the following R command:

system("ls -ld /usr/local /usr/local/lib /usr/local/lib/libtcl*")

Thanks,
Simon

Ah, I see, MacPorts has messed up your system (why am I not surprised ;)).

If you don't use MacPorts yourself (it causes more headaches than good IMHO) I would suggest blowing away /usr/local and re-installing R. If you don't want to resort to such drastic measures, you can try changing the permissions with something like (in Terminal, not R):

sudo chmod a+rx /usr/local/*

That will fix your immediate problem, but MacPorts may have messed with other places as well.

Cheers,
Simon

The GTK_2.24.17-X11.pkg (ca. 41MB) version from http://r.research.att.com/
installs well enough, or so it seems, under Mountain Lion and R-3.0.1.  When 
however I do the following, R crashes:

The crash report is at http://maths-people.anu.edu.au/~johnm/r/issues/rattle.report

The result is similar if I try

library(play with)
playwith()

This was not unexpected; see http://rattle.togaware.com/rattle-install-troubleshooting.html

I've noted also a reported solution at 
  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15868860/r-3-0-and-gtk-rgtk2-error

This however uses Macports, which there has been I think some advice to avoid.

I'd like of course to find a simple solution to getting RGtk2 properly installed, one
preferably that can be suggested to relatively novice users.   Are there relatively
straightforward changes to operating system paths that are likely to fix the problem?

Various Mac users have reported insurmountable difficulties gettting rattle to run on recent version of OSX. The reports remain unanswered on the support mailing list at rattle-users at googlegroups.com. Anything you can do to move that forward would be appreciated, but my impression is that the rattle author has no access to a Mac and is waiting for someone else to trouble shoot it for him. (It appears they are being basically ignored since there have been several reposts in the last few months with no response.)

It's not clear to me that it is the Rgtk2 installation that is at fault, although I could be wrong about that.

Yes, please read the Rcmdr installation notes for Mac users at <

paying particular attention to the instructions for Mac OS X 10.6.

I hope this helps,

Dear Josh,

I'm not a frequent Mac user and my OS is Mountain Lion, so I can offer only
limited help. 

It appears as if the version of Tcl/Tk that's included now with the Mac OS X
release of R (I assume that you're using R 3.0.0 or 3.0.1) needs a newer
version of X-Windows than you have. You might try installing the version of
X-Windows from http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/, which is what's used
now that Apple has stopped shipping X-Windows with OS X. If this works,
please let me know and I'll modify the Rcmdr installation notes.

I'm also copying this response to Rob Goedman, who is much more
knowledgeable than I about Macs, and who has helped Mac OS X users of the
Rcmdr in the past.

Best,
 John

Message-ID: <15811CD1-D596-48F3-A0DE-D3EF8C4668FA@colinsmith.org>

I use R exclusively through the Terminal on Mac OS X and just made a few changes in grDevices to improve the quartz device appearance/functionality:

- I altered how the menus were created so that the "..." and "R" menus appear as "R" and "File".
- I changed the dock icon to use the R logo instead of the default command line program icon.
- I added a menu item to the Window menu that will show the Terminal window/tab the R process is running in.

How should I go about sharing this so that I can get feedback? If others agree, it would be great to have this integrated into the release version at some point.

Cheers,

Colin

The standard procedure is to create diffs against R-devel and submit them to bugzilla as improvement.
In this particular case you can also simply send them to me and I'll have a look.

Thanks,

See the R FAQ:

'There is a section of the bug repository for suggestions for 
enhancements for R labelled ?wishlist?. Suggestions can be submitted in 
the same ways as bugs, but please ensure that the subject line makes 
clear that this is for the wishlist and not a bug report, for example by 
starting with ?Wishlist:?.'
