R on Unix can be run from where it is built, and I frequently move where 
it is built/change symbolic links.  You definitely do not want where it is 
going to be installed, as make check is run where it is built (not that 
that matters when the R(.sh) scripts sets R_HOME).

Message-ID: <ABAB4442-2428-11D8-84C2-000A95A67E82@stat.ucla.edu>

The next distribution updates R-devel, Emacs, and Tcl/Tk (both  
Darwin/X11 and Aqua versions) to the latest CVS version, updates the  
CRAN packages, and replaces Gaurav Khanna's g77 with his Panther  
update. The X11 Emacs is now build with Xaw3d support. This R will be a  
framework build, where /Library/Frameworks/R.framework contains  
Darwin/X11 versions of both R-1.8.1 and R-devel (for the time being  
there is no Aqua or Quartz in my R at all, since you can get that  
elsewhere). Soft links for R and R-devel in /usr/local/bin will start  
R-1.8.1 and R-devel. All the add-on packages are for the moment in the  
R-devel section of the framework, with soft links in the R-1.8.1 part.  
Also added are Simon Urbanek's iplot and rjava packages.

Message-ID: <20031206230719.GA28893@chanane.ucsf.edu>

I just upgraded to 10.3, successfully built R-1.8.1 and
can't get the X11() device to show up from a shell
in terminal.app when X11 is running. Starting an xterm
from X11.app successfully displays R graphics. I routinely
ran R with X11 graphics from within a Terminal.app shell
under 10.2.8. I just had the line
 
quartz-wm & 

in my .xinitrc. This seems to be broken now. Any suggestions?

Would it be a problem of setting the DISPLAY env variable?
10.3 uses bash as default shell and your profile is now that of bash 
init stuff.

In more detail:

 x11(display=":0")

should work, or Sys.putenv("DISPLAY"=":0") followed by just x11().  In
the normal Unix situation, if you have X running then any terminal window will
have been started from X and so will know about the display.  Under Aqua
this isn't true. The RAqua GUI just assumes that if you want an x11()
window you must have an X server running, but that's in the GUI code.

Message-ID: <E9CCA752-2CC3-11D8-B398-000393DB9466@worcester.oxford.ac.uk>

Hi,

I am working on adding R to DarwinPorts and I am having a little 
trouble figuring out how to install Raqua.  The convention for 
installing aqua apps in DarwinPorts is to put them in 
/Applications/DarwinPorts/ but I can't seem to get Raqua to install 
anywhere other than /Applications/StartR.app/Raqua.app/Contents.  I 
tried adding 
--prefix=/Applications/DarwinPorts/StartR.app/Raqua.app/Contents but 
that didn't get carried through to the install-aqua rule in the 
Makefile.  Any suggestions would be great.

Thanks,

Kjell

Kjell,
you should better work on the Developer version of R, as the RAqua is 
not relocatable in the release version of R 1.8.1.

The install-aqua in R-1.8.1 overrides the --prefix option.

Btw, in R-devel we already R build as a framework and RAqua (now called 
simply R) relocatable.
doing
make
make install-Rframework
make install-aqua

will do the job.

We are going to add a specific flag to the configure procedure, we will 
probably commit to r-devel something around the weekend.

Message-ID: <FC56A80C-2FFF-11D8-8F50-000393BB6D36@stat.ucla.edu>

The 12/16/03 version updates R-devel to the latest CVS version and
updates the CRAN and Bioconductor packages. It also adds new CRAN  
packages,
bringing the total to over 400 packages.

This R is a framework build, where /Library/Frameworks/R.framework
contains Darwin/X11/Aqua versions of R-devel. A soft link R in  
/usr/local/bin will
start R in the various CLI's. RAqua is there, in /Applications, now  
simply called R.

The quartz device works from the various Python shells, the X11 device  
works from all shells. Make sure /usr/local/bin is in
your path and observe /usr/local/lib/R is no longer used and can be  
removed from your computer.

There is no longer an R-1.8.1 in the framework, and /Library/R is no  
longer used either. Rpy is updated
to work with the new setup. R.app is relocatable. This version has the  
new organization of the
base package used in R-devel. I removed RQuantlib and the GTK based  
packages. I included the wrong
Emacs support files in the previous version, that has been fixed.

R CMD INSTALL Rggobi

it always tells me:

Has anybody have successful experience in installing Rggobi on MacOS X.
