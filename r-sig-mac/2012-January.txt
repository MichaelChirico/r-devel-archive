Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] troubles with tkrplot
Message-ID: <7389F0F4-B0EF-484A-8079-05E2EA29DE83@pitt.edu>

Hello, and Happy New Year!

Problems with tcl/tk, tkrplot etc, running R.app or R on Lion :


Running the example from tkrplot,
dozens of error messages are generated of the form
1: In plot.xy(xy, type, ...) :
  X11 protocol error: BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes)
2: In plot.xy(xy, type, ...) :
  X11 protocol error: BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes)
3: In axis(side = side, at = at, labels = labels, ...) :
  X11 protocol error: BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes)
etcetera.

My work with tcltk was dormant for a long time ... over a year.
I don't remember these messages before.  Makes me suspect Lion.
I've reinstalled R and tcltk;  no change.

X11 "about" shows "XQuartz 2.6.3 (xorg-server 1.10.3)".
I've tried installing XQuartz 2.7.1, but then R hangs on loading tcltk.
So I reset DISPLAY to ":0" or ":1", and X11 works fine but generates the error messages noted.

The tkrplot example code does work as it's supposed to - the plot updates as one resets the slider -  despite the error messages.

But I want to understand what's happening...
and of course for my project, though it is working, I don't want these messages plaguing users.

Any advice?  Or redirect my question to another forum?
Thanks for any help!

What didn't work? Downloading it? Installing it?

What problem? Lion works just fine, so can you be more specific as of what happens?

Message-ID: <20120109124551.atjgokjftcccok4s@imp.inserm.fr>

I find that the ESC key for aborting a line of code or stopping
execution and also the STOP button are not working in R 2.14.1.
I thought that this might be a Lion related issue as I updated
both my OS and R version at the same time but I see the problem
on an older machine running Snow Leopard, too.  I can't give
an example.  Just write a line of code and hit escape before
you hit return.  This used to abort the command.  Was this a
bug earlier that is fixed, or is it a feature that can be
restored?  Thanks, in advance.

Here is the session info.

R version 2.14.1 Patched (2012-01-08 r58078)
Platform: x86_64-apple-darwin9.8.0/x86_64 (64-bit)

Happens on 32-bit R, also.

Hi Ken,

yes - the ESC behaviour was slightly changed/improved.

Pressing ESC while R is EXECUTING R code including statements like "system('foo', wait=T) will try to interrupt the R code AND kill 'foo' resp.

If R isn't executing something ESC invokes completion since this is the standard Mac app behaviour.

You wrote: "Just write a line of code and hit escape before you hit return.  This used to abort the command."

Well, it did not abort the command since the command wasn't executed yet, it only cleared the current command line buffer which differs from the actual intention of pressing ESC => 'Interrupt current R computation' I think.

To get the 'old' behaviour you can press ??? (standard short-cut to select from cursor position to start of line) if your cursor is at the end of the current line to select what you've already written and start typing again.


Kind regards,
--Hans

Thanks, Hans,

That works for clearing the line.  I should have looked at the NEWS for
the R.app GUI:

Last-update: 2011-12-22 [HJBB]
*	In RConsole pressing the ESC key will invoke
	"completion" as in standard application if no
	R command runs including system(..., wait=TRUE)
	otherwise pressing ESC key or STOP button will
	try to terminate the running R command and, if
	a system(..., wait=TRUE) runs, it will kill the
	system command

but how about if I have an uncompleted command, i.e. with + prompt.
ESC used to jump out of that and it doesn't nor does ??? seem
to work?  Thanks, again.

best,

Ken

I've to admit your point. I fine-tuned that behaviour in such a way that if R prompts : "+ " the user has the chance to abort the current uncompleted command by pressing ESC to be able to jump out of it.

Many thanks for the hint!

Hey there

I am having a bit of trouble getting this working, I had to do a bit
of fiddling with makefiles to get it to find the right gfortran, but
it builds & links without error, however the install gives the
following error:

You have used some special (?) gfortran at compile time (based on the
above, but I am not sure).  This may not work with R that has been
compiled with another gfortran and it might also not work at run time.

We really need more information about exactly what you have done.

I do not believe gfortran comes with OS X, so I installed the latest
version. R was picking up a version that had been installed with
octave, which is why I needed to make some changes as I did not want
to link R libs with something packaged with octave (because if i
update or remove octave all my R libs will break).

I don't think that is a material part of the issue, and doing some
digging I see it is not just my machine:

http://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_LogicReg.html
http://www.r-project.org/nosvn/R.check/r-release-macosx-ix86/LogicReg-00install.html

Which shows the same error. Can you build the package OK?

Thanks

I should add, it is the same version of gfortran that R is expecting,
just installed in a different location

Ok, I was wondering if you were picking up the same gfortran at run
and compile time.  I see the error on the cran building machine, so it
is probably an issue at the package level.

I suggest emailing the two authors about it.  I know for sure Ingo is
using a Mac as a laptop, so perhaps he has something insightful to say
about this.

What precise OS and which architecture is this (see the posting guide)?

AFAIK LogicReg will install on x86_64 on a Mac (nowadays the default for 
most people) but not the 32-bit architectures.

It predefines some very large arrays: try reducing LGCn1MAX (twice) in 
slogic.f .  It then works for me (I tried 10000).

And if this works for you, please report to the package maintainer.

Message-ID: <FC60A7A8-3120-4355-80E0-85404D2BEC13@imperial.ac.uk>

Hi,

I am on OS X 10.7.2, Xcode 4.2.1, R 2.14.1 (GUI 6008) and I was wondering what would happen if I installed 

gcc-4.2 (Apple build 5666.3) with GNU Fortran 4.2.4 for Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion)
(from http://r.research.att.com/tools/)

and then Apple released Xcode 4.2.2? would I have to reinstall gcc-4.2 and gfortran after upgrading Xcode?

BW

Federico

I didn't actually test it, but Xcode should not touch the gcc-4.2 installed by us, so the answer should be no (if Apple plays by its own rules).

All incarnations of XCode that I have seen have linked dev tool binaries 
into /usr. The package installs compilers to /usr/local so they should be 
safe.

There are rumblings indicating that XCode 4.3 will keep the dev tools 
internal to XCode.app its self and not link anything to /usr other than a 
few utility tools such as xcode_select.

No, the gcc-4.2 package (and gfortran for Xcode) installs into /usr

Interestingly there is iOS beta but no OS X beta so I wouldn't panic since for iOS it makes sense.

My mistake. I've been re-rooting the installation to `/usr/local` for so 
long that my brain thinks that is where it lives.

We have been getting lots of reports from XCode beta users that the next 
iteration will be a self-contained application bundle:

Hi Hans,

I am wondering if there will be a way to customize this behavior. I am
kind of used to using TAB for completion and ESC for clearing the
current line :)

The old but improved behaviour was recovered in the last built without having the chance to customise.

R workspace is not loaded when a rdata file is opened in finder.
However, It happens only when R is closed.
When R is opened and rdata is opened in finder, the workspace is loaded.

Your message is a bit cryptic, but if the way I parse it you're simply describing the normal behavior of R. When you start a fresh R you can specify the directory that you want to start it in by dragging - just like cd + R would do. Once R is running, the workspace is already loaded, so obviously it doesn't make sense to just replace it with another one.

Simon

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Data editor replacing empty strings by NA
Message-ID: <4F1EF69A.2070509@stats.ox.ac.uk>

Dear All,

I have a data frame with empty strings in some cells. If I use fix() in 
R.app I get the strings replaced by NA. If use fix() in a terminal (I 
get an X window) I do not. No editing in either case.

mydf <- data.frame(x=rep("",3), y=1:3, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
mydf
fix(mydf)
mydf

sessionInfo() is:
R version 2.14.1 (2011-12-22)
Platform: x86_64-apple-darwin9.8.0/x86_64 (64-bit)

locale:
[1] en_GB.UTF-8/en_GB.UTF-8/en_GB.UTF-8/C/en_GB.UTF-8/en_GB.UTF-8

attached base packages:
[1] stats     graphics  grDevices utils     datasets  methods   base

This appears to be a recent change of behavior in R.app.

I can work around this, but suspect it is not the intended behavior.

Regards,

Ruth

I, too, would like to run multiple versions of R, via command line, on Mac OS X. 
I have looked in vain for a clear explanation of why there can be one and only 
one 'Current' version of R running at a time.

After running the installer, I manually edit the 
/Library/Frameworks/Versions/<version>/Resources/bin/R script.
Replacing the '/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources' with 
'/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.14/Resources'.

Is this sufficient to support multiple versions of R on a Mac?

Thanks,
Peter

You can dig up some info from this thread:

https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-mac/2011-September/008582.html

I believe the take home message is that if you want to do this
(running different R versions *simultaneously*), you can do some
symlink mojo (you'll find links to examples in that thread) that will
let you do so, and (for the most part), it will work.

The problem arises when you have to install R packages that need be
source compiled. This limitation holds if we are talking about running
R versions that were released as binaries on CRAN (I'm not sure if
this is true when you compile R as a framework build yourself (but my
guess is that it will still be a problem in that scenario, as well)).

I can link you straight to the email that says that (w/ more details),
but you'd probably better be served by just going through the entirety
of that thread.

Hope that helps,
-steve

That is simply untrue, and would be crippling for the R developers if it 
were true.

Assuming you have multiple R versions installed, all you need to do is 
to invoke their 'R' scripts directly.   There is a problem caused by the 
way Simon installs these scripts in frameworks, so e.g.

/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.13/Resources/bin/R

starts

#!/bin/sh
# Shell wrapper for R executable.

R_HOME_DIR=/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources

but all you have to do is make a copy and change that to e.g.

R_HOME_DIR=/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.13/Resources

[Which is in the thread mentioned.]

And of course, no one said you have to use that particular build of R, 
and for serious users of command-line R a personal build will be more 
convenient (just like any other platform).

If you have packages which use compiled code they are tied (on OS X 
only) to a particular 2.x.* set of R versions, but you can overcome that 
easily enough by using different library directories for different 
versions of R.

Message-ID: <69BC0AB6-F77F-435B-85DF-60EA30FBB8F0@tng.iac.es>

Hi,

after googling around I surrender and post to this list.
With a Mac OS 10.7.2, R installation 2.14.1, X server starts but doesn't find the fonts.
The solution is not to check xorgs.conf as there is no such config file here.

The behavior is easily spotted:
> plot(1,1)
Error in axis(side = side, at = at, labels = labels, ...) : 
  could not find any X11 fonts
Check that the Font Path is correct.
In addition: Warning messages:
1: In function (display = "", width, height, pointsize, gamma, bg,  :
  locale not supported by Xlib: some X ops will operate in C locale
2: In function (display = "", width, height, pointsize, gamma, bg,  :
  X cannot set locale modifiers
> 
R Graphics: Device 1 (ACTIVE) starts, plot one circle but stops on that error.

Any help for this?
Thank you

Can you please follow the posting guide and tell us your sessionInfo() 
(and are you using R.app or R, the command-line version?).

That your locale is not recognized by X11 may be significant, and 
sessionInfo() includes the locale information.

I think that is wrong: there is no locale called 'UTF-8' in standard 
naming schemes.  I have
[1] C/en_GB.UTF-8/en_GB.UTF-8/C/en_GB.UTF-8/en_GB.UTF-8

See the 'R Installation and Administration Manual' (and please keep 
R-sig-mac on the reply list).

Hello Brian,

I "followed" the admin manual, and set the lines in the .bashrc
# Setting for the new UTF-8 terminal support in Lion
export LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8
export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8

this solves the locale (and R font problem):
> sessionInfo()
R version 2.14.1 (2011-12-22)
Platform: x86_64-apple-darwin9.8.0/x86_64 (64-bit)

locale:
[1] en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/C/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8

Thank you again.
Emilio

Hi Jarrett,

Take a look at the effects package, in particular ?effect, which includes methods for mer and lme objects.

(I'm not sure why you'd post this to the r-sig-mac list.)

Best,

That thread does help and it provides enough information to solve most of my 
problem. However, it is not clear to me how to change the R_HOME directory so 
that it is not in the /Library/Frameworks/R.framework directory. This is 
important to me because I am providing a tool which will automatically install R 
and I don't want my tool to replace an existing version of R.

I tried building from source, and immediately ran into two problems:
     1) I don't know enough to know how to configure my build so that it doesn't 
use the Frameworks location
     2) specifically to R 2.5, which I need, I get compiler errors.

I'd like to simply take apart the framework build I get when install from the 
R-2.5.1.dmg. However, I'd also like this to work, even when I move this to a 
different location on my file system. I appreciate some guidance on this last step.

Thanks,
Peter

You don't need to use the framework version of R if you don't need the GUI. If your copy will be "private" you can use --disable-R-framework and set rhome at install time to wherever you want (or alternatively you can set the path of the framework if you need it). Note that you'll have to re-compile all packages as well.

You'll have to share much more detail. Note that such an ancient version of R may not be buildable on your system without SDKs for older OS X versions (and note that recent Xcode tools default to 64-bit which was not supported back then so you may need to use 32-bit).


> I'd like to simply take apart the framework build I get when install from the R-2.5.1.dmg.

It is possible, albeit convoluted. The easy part of to modify R_HOME - you simply do that in the R script. The harder part is that all binaries have absolute paths to libraries inside the framework. You will have to go through every single binary (package, module, executable) and change all paths to your new location using install_name_tool. To be honest, given how ancient your R is I wouldn't even bother and just keep it in its 2.5 folder since chances that it will clash on user's machine are close to zero. But if you choose to tackle this, you can take inspiration from this script (it uses @rpath which is a bit more flexible but requires more support from binaries):

https://svn.r-project.org/R-dev-web/trunk/QA/Simon/R-build/rpath.sh

An alternative fix is to use DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH to prepend your new location of libraries. It may or may not work, depending on what you use from R. It is a bit fragile but is fairly easy to do so you can test whether it works for your particular setup of using R.


> However, I'd also like this to work, even when I move this to a different location on my file system. I appreciate some guidance on this last step.

That is actually close to impossible unless you are ok with giving up package installation. The problem is that a) binary package have full paths encoded and b) if you compile a package it will get full path and they need a path to compile. However, if you are shipping a "fixed" R that will not be modified by adding packages, you can use the same idea as above with the special @executable_path prefix. You'll need to perform some gymnastics to infer R_HOME in the R script since it will by dynamic, but it's possible -- the following patch will give you an idea:

https://svn.r-project.org/R-dev-web/trunk/QA/Simon/R-build/R-rpath-diff

The executive summary is that what you want is possible, but not really easy.

Simon

I get compiler errors:

     ld: duplicate symbol _Rf_mkChar in CommandLineArgs.o and CConverters.o

However, I did not explicitly use 32-bit. Is this a compiler flag? I will look 
into it.

Hi All,

Is anybody else experiencing problems with X11 and R under Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion)? If yes, maybe it's not specific to my machine. R segfaults when I try to plot to a X11 device, e.g. open R in the terminal and calling   
> plot (1:10)
(see below). Plotting to a quartz device works fine. I'm using R-2.14.1 (see below), compiled from source using homebrew. I've seen the same issue with the CRAN binaries, with a vanilla compile from source of R-2.14.1 and even with an old R-2.9.2. 

I wonder whether I'd have to wait for a fix from Apple, or whether there's a work-around like something that can be done during configuration? 

Cheers,
Martin

For what it is worth I don't see this problem on Snow Leopard, self-compiled.

You can make quartz the default device by putting
 Sys.setenv("R_INTERACTIVE_DEVICE" = "quartz")
in your .Rprofile.

Martin,

can you specify more precisely what you're doing? Issuing the code you sent would use Quartz, so apparently you're doing other things that you didn't mention - so can you share those so we can try to reproduce it?

Thanks,
Simon

Here is one more confusing issue:

I know that sessionInfo() gives
locale:
[1] C

This was the case when starting R64.app or starting R from the command 
line. Following the advice from an earlier topic I did on the command line:
$ defaults write org.R-project.R force.LANG en_US.UTF-8

Since starting R on the command line did not change anything I tried 
this a couple of times. This did not change anything when starting R 
from xterm, but now I the following effect on R64.app.
Here the sessionInfo() now gives
locale:
[1] en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/C/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8

Now I have no idea how to get rid of these locales on R64.app and how to 
get the correct locale on R started on xterm.

BTW, I do know the following mails:
https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-mac/2012-January/008945.html
https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-mac/2012-January/008948.html

The proposed solution is to add in .bahrc:
export LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8
export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8

However, I am not sure if this is the correct solution or only a 
workaround for the following reasons:
1, I have always installed R-x.pkg from Simon since many years on Tiger, 
Leopard, and Snow Leopard and never had to add anything to .bashrc.
2, All my OS X versions are set to US English (and not to German).

So my questions are:
- Why does installing R-2.14.1.pkg on Lion cause the problem with the 
locale?
- Did anything change on Lion?
- Do I really have to use the workaround to add above lines to .bashrc?

Best regards
Christian

Christian,

what exactly are you talking about? This is entirely unrelated to the thread you replied to and you're mixing several completely unrelated things below. The locale is set by your system, not by R. To break down the situations:

- R on the console uses the locale set by the shell it is run from. The most common cases:

a) in Terminal the encoding is set in the Terminal's preferences (Advanced->International->Character encoding) and the default is UTF-8. If you change it in your shell startup files, it will be overridden.

b) xterm inherits your local shell/login settings which are unset by default so you will be in C locale (assuming you didn't start xterm from Terminal - then a) applies, obviously)

- R.app GUI uses your system settings (System Preferences -> Language & Text) for the language and UTF-8 for encoding. If your settings are inconsistent (conflicting language and format settings) it will give you a warning and fall back to C. The GUI is designed to work only in the UTF-8 encoding. The "defaults write org.R-project.R force.LANG en_US.UTF-8" command only affects the R.app GUI and has the same effect as setting "LANG" to that value in the shell - in your case you are setting the locale to US english and encoding to UTF-8.

R doesn't care which locale you run it in - it is entirely up to you. You get what you ask for :). Only the R.app GUI cares since all I/O is in UTF-8 so you should either pick a UTF-8 locale or set your system properly, otherwise you'll get errors when using non-ASCII characters in file names etc.

I hope it helps.

Cheers,
Simon

Chances are that you DISPLAY is unset - you possibly messed with it in your startup files so R can't use X11 unless you give it the proper display. On a clean OS X you will see it set properly, e.g.:

> Sys.getenv("DISPLAY")
[1] "/tmp/launch-byCZTH/org.x:0"

Please check that your DISPLAY is set (and that you don't mess with R options, either). This is setting is automatic on SL/Lion.

Cheers,
Simon

Dear Simon,

Thank you for your replies, I understand now your explanation about R.app.

I do not think that the topic on the locale is unrelated to the plot 
problem, since adding to .bashrc:
   export LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8
   export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
does solve the problem with plot(), as you can see from the following 
output:

 > Sys.getenv("DISPLAY")
[1] ":0"
 > sessionInfo()
R version 2.14.1 (2011-12-22)
Platform: x86_64-apple-darwin9.8.0/x86_64 (64-bit)

locale:
[1] en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/C/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8

attached base packages:
[1] stats     graphics  grDevices utils     datasets  methods   base
 > plot(1:8)

It is still not clear to me why I need to add above lines to .bashrc, 
since on my Snow Leopard machine this is not necessary. The locale there 
is also only C.

BTW, to run R I start always X11.app first and then start R from xterm, 
I do not use the Terminal.

Best regards
Christian

Thank you to everybody who replied! Simon, on my machine, I can reproduce this segfault every time using these steps:

- open Terminal.app (or iTerm or Aquamacs), start R --vanilla  (RStudio, or R.app)
in R:   
   - x11()   (in Terminal, my R defaults to x11, without me doing anything; in R.app or RStudio, I call x11() to reproduce this segfault. 
   - plot (1:10) or any other plotting command. 
I am not aware of any other conscious or subconscious steps I'm taking. Plotting to quartz() or pdf() works fine. My .bashrc sets R_LIBS and the usual additions to the default PATH, nothing that should affect R or x11. Since I haven't heard back a flood of people saying, 'yes, me too', I suspect, this issue is specific to my setup. I've tried clearing out any preference files related to x11, to no affect. When calling plot (1:10), I get a new x11 graphics window, ten circles and an x-axis with tick-marks, and a segfault. No box(), no y-axis. There's no .Rprofile in my home directory. Are there any other preference files that could be corrupted? 

My display variable looks fine, so Christian seems to have a different issue than me.

Never mind - you did in your first e-mail. But from that info it is clear that you're not using CRAN R, so I fear we can't really help you since this problem is specific to your own R build. You should try the R release on CRAN to see if you can reproduce it with that. If not, you may want to use gdb to trace the issue (R -d gdb) - it could be R or some library you're using ... If you want us to look int that, you'd have to provide exact details on how you compiled that R (compiler versions, configure flags etc.).

Cheers,
Simon

Hi All,

maybe I caught a bug, but my input is in blue, and cannot be modified, on R-GUI 64 bit, built 6049, installed today 30th of Jan, 2012.

I use white text on a black background, and I seem unable to specify a white input -- it just ignores me and uses blue. Output is white though. I have to say it is a right pain in the proverbial.

Hi Federico,

thanks a lot for the hint! It should be fixed in rev 6050, thus please try it out.

But when I'm launching R with R.app (or R studio), the $PATH I get from Sys.getenv() has nothing to do with my current and real $PATH : 

> Sys.getenv()[["PATH"]]
[1] "/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin"


I've managed to set up the $PATH directory through the use of .Renviron, but I would really like R.app to read my $PATH from 
my .bash_profil, which is not the case.


Thanks by advance for any help.

Try R for Mac FAQ 12.19.

R.app is not a shell - and neither is R - so they simply use the environment you setup. .bash_* fines are only used by bash, so unless you start bash they have no meaning.

R.app inherits the environment from the launch services which don't read your profile - again, it's not a shell. See Apple's QA in how to change the environments for apps:

I tried CRAN R again, and could NOT reproduce this error, at least not this time. Maybe I inadvertently used my own compiled version last time I tried CRAN R.  I may try the folks at homebrew to trace this issue. Thank you so much to everybody who chimed in. 

Cheers,
Martin

You should try the R release on CRAN to see if you can reproduce it with that. If not, you may want to use gdb to trace the issue (R -d gdb) - it could be R or some library you're using ... If you want us to look int that, you'd have to provide exact details on how you compiled that R (compiler versions, configure flags etc.).

My .bashrc sets R_LIBS and the usual additions to the default PATH, nothing that should affect R or x11. Since I haven't heard back a flood of people saying, 'yes, me too', I suspect, this issue is specific to my setup. I've tried clearing out any preference files related to x11, to no affect. When calling plot (1:10), I get a new x11 graphics window, ten circles and an x-axis with tick-marks, and a segfault. No box(), no y-axis. There's no .Rprofile in my home directory. Are there any other preference files that could be corrupted?
