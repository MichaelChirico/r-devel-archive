Many thanks Roy - it helped me, at least!

Simon: This command ought perhaps to be included on  https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools/  as part of the "important note"

It is obscure, with no good duckduckgo or stackoverflow results if the user types in their error message.

Best, tim

Roy,

thanks, but can you give some details? I'm on a Mojave system and don't see any issues - this will likely depend on your Xcode installation. Does it mean some Xcode version is lacking headers? Which version, how did you install it?

Thanks,
Simon

Hi Simon:

here goes.  I was running 10.13.xx,  xx being whatever was the most recent version.  I was compiling packages from source no problem.  Also,  the Upgrade Section of App Store was telling me there was an incompatible version of software available,  which was a new version of Xcode.

I upgraded to 10.14.4,  by the usual means,  did nothing special.

Upgrades in App Store said there was a new version of Xcode (among other things).  So installed that.

Ran Xcode,  so that it would install "Other Components" which it often does with a new version.

To be certain I had the Command lIne Tools,  in a terminal I ran:   sudo xcode-select --install

Next time I ran RStudio,  two package upgrades were from source  (I apologize I don't remember which packages).  Compilation failed with errors of couldn't find the appropriate header files.

Ran the command in my note.

Restarted RStudio,  asked it to check for package updates,  same packages appeared,  compilation went fine.

I am running Xcode 10.2

HTH,

-Roy

Roy,

great, thanks, I'll try to replicate that. I'm really surprised that an upgrade would delete headers - that's very unfriendly to say the least ;). I did upgrade Mojave but I did not upgrade Xcode (newer version tend to break more and more things) so that's maybe why I didn't see it.

Thanks,
Simon

Yes I had a feeling that the Xcode update did it,  which is why I included that fact.  The upgrade must have also zapped someone else,  because that note was in the R Admin and Install Doc.  I am not even quite certain all that command does,  just know the problem magically went away.

I also recall after updating to Xcode 10.2 on my Mojave machine that
the system headers normally installed at /usr/include had vanished,
and re-installing the headers with the aforementioned package at
/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages/macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10.14.pkg
fixed things up. So I would echo the sentiment that it would be
helpful to have a note :-)

FWIW, 

I had the same experience - updated to 10.14.4 and got a Command Line Tools update and then found /usr/include wiped clean. 

From my installation log, it looks like these two items

	macOS 10.14.4 Update
	Command Line Tools (macOS Mojave version 10.14) for Xcode

have the same timestamp followed by another 

	macOS 10.14.4 Update

about 20 minutes later (which I think is usual looking at earlier updates).

I've not updated Xcode per se for a very long time. The files in the Xcode.app directory are all time-stamped from 2016. In fact, I cannot even start the Xcode.app - it may need to be reinstalled.

---

I fixed things just as others have reported, viz by running the "sudo installer -pkg " idiom from the install and admin manual appendix C.3, "As from macOS 10.14 (?Mojave?) an additional step is needed ..."


HTH,

Chuck

This is documented in the manual, including that updating CLT wiped out 
the headers in /usr/include: 
https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-devel/R-admin.html#macOS .

On my Mojave system the OS update to 10.14.4 updated the CLT without 
asking separately.

Note too that the fix to reinstate the headers is hinted by Apple to be 
for 10.14 only, so the alternative (to set CPPFLAGS) may be preferable.

Thanks, I have finally traced it down. It is a combination of the removal of headers from system location *and* our custom toolchain. Apple's macOS 10.14 clang builds automatically insert the path to the SDK:

"/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/clang" -cc1 -triple x86_64-apple-macosx10.14.0 [...] -isysroot /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX10.14.sdk [...]

#include <...> search starts here:
 /usr/local/include
 /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/lib/clang/10.0.0/include
 /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/include
 /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX10.14.sdk/usr/include
 /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX10.14.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks (framework directory)

Whereas out clang6 build uses the system location:

#include <...> search starts here:
 /usr/local/include
 /usr/local/clang6/lib/clang/6.0.0/include
 /System/Library/Frameworks (framework directory)
 /Library/Frameworks (framework directory)

So, similar to the R-admin suggestions all that's needed is
-isysroot /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk
and hope that Apple will maintain the non-versioned symlink to the SDK. I'll see if I can release a new build of clang that will use it automatically. From my tests so far that location is valid all the way down to 10.11 so should work for us.

Probably the fastest fix for now if you just need to install a package is to set
PKG_CPPFLAGS='-isysroot /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk'

It will work as long as you use the command line tools (recommended) - if you use Xcode directly you may need to check its location with xcrun --show-sdk-path

Cheers,
Simon

I have upgraded to Mojave (10.14.4) and updated the Xtools (don't know if
this is relevant). Keep getting this error message when opening R, latest

This would not be a huge issue, except that it prevents me from building
packages. In the Terminal, I get the same error and it stops there:

Thanks Mark, the culprit was indeed .Rprofile

I did previously inspect this file but did not cross my mind it would cause
that error, as it contains a single line to load a package at startup.
Deleted the file, re-create it with the same command and it works now.
Cannot explain why it previously triggered the error, just glad I'm back on
track.

Thanks again,
Adrian

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] printing bug: clipping the bottom and right-hand thirds
 of the plot window
Message-ID: <52C71944-BA3E-4934-B2B8-D54279AA120D@ed.ac.uk>

With a plot window open and a plot rendered in it, printing (cmd-P) clips the graph (the bottom and right hand side thirds of the graph are clipped/masked white)

This clipped image displays in the print preview and the printed image is clipped.

Seems to affect all plots the same. The clipped region seems to be a constant proportion of the window. (i.e., resizing the plot resizes the clipped region proportionally).

Makes printing useless. Doesn't seem to affect saving.

this simple line of code reproduces the bug

plot(mpg~wt, data=mtcars)


My R version is  3.5.2 (2018-12-20)
Platform: x86_64-apple-darwin15.6.0
MacOS: 10.14.5


PS: Saving the image leaves this message in the console... (and has done since mac adopted the cloud folders_

objc[40467]: Class FIFinderSyncExtensionHost is implemented in both /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/FinderKit.framework/Versions/A/FinderKit (0x7fffa67d93c8) and /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/FileProvider.framework/OverrideBundles/FinderSyncCollaborationFileProviderOverride.bundle/Contents/MacOS/FinderSyncCollaborationFileProviderOverride (0x116f84f50). One of the two will be used. Which one is undefined.

Adrian,

The first thing that comes to mind is the possibility that you have something in a file that runs when you start up R such as Rprofile.site.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Problem with Devel version (R 3.6) for Mac OS X
Message-ID: <243B0521-E76E-47F8-8914-54D9A34F6523@stat.berkeley.edu>

Hello,

I am wanting to download the development version for R. I have Mac OS X 11.6 and I usually go to http://r.research.att.com/ <http://r.research.att.com/> and download a dmg from there. However, the devel version is listed as  3.5.2 (2018/12/20, r75870), not 3.6. When I downloaded it anyway, I couldn?t use the development version of bioconductor because I didn?t have the right R. 

Also, the R.app for that dmg did not work (only the command line worked), with a message that I should check to make sure I have the right OS (see full report below). The website just says el-capitan, which I do have. (the log for the development version also says make FAILED).

I feel like somehow I?m getting a non-updated version of a mirror or something. 

Thanks for any help,
Elizabeth Purdom

Elizabeth,

yes, if the status say FAILED then you cannot install that R version since it doesn't work. However, the current nightly build shows OK so you please try that one.

Cheers,
Simon

Thanks Simon for getting that build running again.  I?m not sure if it matters, but the website says the current version is r76363 but what was downloaded was r76245.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Problem with Devel version (R 3.6) for Mac OS X

Nit: 3.6.x is not the devel version at this point (even if unreleased). Dunno why there is no actual R-devel (3.7.x) binaries. 

However, the tarball does have (in Rversion.h) 

#define R_SVN_REVISION 76363

and SVN-REVISION likewise

are you seeing something different with the .pkg version?

Sorry if I was not clear.  I downloaded R-3.6-branch-el-capitan-signed.pkg from https://mac.r-project.org/ <https://mac.r-project.org/> (redirects from r.research.att.com <http://r.research.att.com/>), which is the binary  + GUI with installer.  Once it installed, the start up message said it was r76245, but the web site said r76363.

I have a similar problem. Today https://mac.r-project.org/ says:

 ? R-3.6-branch
 ? 3.6.0 beta
 ? (2019/04/14, r76394)

but after downloading and installing it I got:

 ? R version 3.6.0 alpha (2019-04-09 r76363)

Thanks,
H.

Thanks - there was a bug in the sync script that synchronizes binaries from the build machines to the webserver (created when we stopped syncing mavericks binaries) so that the binaries were not correctly synced with the web server. Hence a stale .pkg and tar balls were on the webserver. It should be fixed now.

Thanks,
Simon

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Xcode 10.2.1
Message-ID: <CAC2h7utJMu+5Re9CSv++N2zNR5FfLW8sO+C2-OkkWd2KMY_YFg@mail.gmail.com>

I am on Mojave. I recently updated to Xcode 10.2.1 and I did the associated
update of the command line tools. Following this, I reinstalled clang6 and
gfortran 6 from CRAN.

When I use the clang6 compiler from CRAN, it is unable to find stdio.h.

When I compare the include path from clang6 to the Apple suppled clang with
`$CC -E - -v` I get

with Apple clang
#include <...> search starts here:
 /usr/local/include
 /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/lib/clang/10.0.1/include
 /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/include
 /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.14.sdk/usr/include
 /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.14.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks
(framework directory)
End of search list.

with clang6 from CRAN
#include <...> search starts here:
 /usr/local/include
 /usr/local/clang6/lib/clang/6.0.0/include
 /System/Library/Frameworks (framework directory)
 /Library/Frameworks (framework directory)
End of search list.

Did Apple move the headers around? Or have I somehow hosed my system?

Best,
Kasper

Hi Kaspar:

There is an issue of where Xcode puts headers.  I have posted on this previously.  I did the same update as you,  and not only doesn't Xcode put the headers where R expects,  it appears to delete the existing headers.  

Anyhow,  try running the following and see if your problems go away:

> sudo installer -pkg \
> /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages/macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10.14.pkg \
> -target /

Doh! Sorry to have missed that email thread.

This advice solved the issue for me.

Yes that is where I found the command.  I would add though that I had done that for Xcode 10.2.0, and appears that when you install the new versions that the installer actually deletes the headers at that location.  At least that is what happened to me when I updated to Xcode 10.2.1.  So people should be aware of this.  Each update may delete the headers.

In the previous thread,  Simon was looking into possibly changing where the R tools look for the headers, but that sort of thing is beyond my pay grade.

Yes, I did, if you used R 3.6.0 there would be no issue (as long as you have command line tools installed).

I just saw that the Mac version was now available.  given the numbering this would mean reinstalling packages correct?  If i use in mechanism in the R GUI to do so,  does it preserve location - that is the packages in the Framework directory are update  to that system location,  and the packages in my own library stay in my own library?

If not,  I should be able to write a script to do so, but if the GUI will already do it,  i would prefer to use that.  May wait a few days for packages to keep up.

thanks for all your work,

-roy

I'm not saying you should upgrade, just that I hope this is now fixed in the latest R release.

The GUI allows you to replicate the package install, but the each library is separate (so it doesn't break). It works for the system location, I don't think it knows or handles any custom user libraries - that you' dhave to do with a script.

Is there a command to list installed packages?

I currently keep track manually and just run a script.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] strange error message when using file selector after
 start of R.app
Message-ID: <E85A9E9E-1E96-4859-BDFB-797058FC9D10@xs4all.nl>

Dear R users/experts,


Since a few months I own a MacBook Air with Mac OS "Mojave".
Since I installed R 3.5.2 on it, I get the error message (in red) in the R.app console, the first time I invoke a file selector (e.g. to laod a script).
After updating to 3.6.0 the same error message occurs.
I don't get this with R.app on an other computer, running R 3.6.0 on Mac OS El Capitan.


> objc[12326]: Class FIFinderSyncExtensionHost is implemented in both /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/FinderKit.framework/Versions/A/FinderKit (0x7fff95bf43c8) and /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/FileProvider.framework/OverrideBundles/FinderSyncCollaborationFileProviderOverride.bundle/Contents/MacOS/FinderSyncCollaborationFileProviderOverride (0x10a5fdf50). One of the two will be used. Which one is undefined.


This is far beyond my R knowledge. Does anybody know  (i) what it means, and  (ii) how to solve or get rid of this (apparent) problem?
If it is not Mac-specific, I could post it to the general R-help.

Thanking you in advance,

This is a Mac-specific issue with Mojave.  It appears in the console logs for many running applications.  It seems to be of no consequence, and I imagine Apple will fix it at some point.  Upshot: don?t worry about it.  :->

Adding to the issues I am getting, now if I do

library(export)

Xquartz (or X11, however we want to call it) is called up.  As it is a completely different app I close it, and R.app closes.

I?d like to know, is it just me or is it a bona fide R issue?

Federico,

export is using rgl which in turn is using X11 so it's not "completely different app" - it's the GUI that you asked R to use. Why export uses rgl unconditionally is a question you'd have to ask the author - it's generally not a good idea since packages like that cannot be used on any compute servers.

Cheers,
Simon
