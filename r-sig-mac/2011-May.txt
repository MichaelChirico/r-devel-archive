Where from?  Not CRAN.

This is better discussed on R-sig-geo, but I suspect that either you 
have a local GDAL installation and local settings (in which case you 
probably need to build rgdal from source to match ) or you got 
rdgal_0.6-33.tgz from someone who has.  (Mine on CRANxtras is entirely 
static and I have no such directory on my system.)

Hello,

I am unable to write a pathway to .csv files saved on my computer.  I
can get this to work on a windows machine, but the mac returns a
message saying the file does not exist.  Any tips on how to import
data on mac's?  For example, the below line was unsuccesful.
read.csv(file="Macintosh HD:Users:ThorJ:Desktop:heightweight.csv"

Many thanks,

Thor

Hi Thor,

Open a terminal window, drag the .csv file to that window, copy the path that will appear in that terminal into your read.csv command.

Hi,

Looks like you're using the MacOS-type path name, rather than the unix-type.
The following should work:
read.csv(file="/Users/ThorJ/Desktop/heightweight.csv")

Cheers,
Martin

Thor, 

One of the most important things when asking a question on a list is some context. From the line below it would appear that you might be using Mac OS 9? If this is the case, you are unlikely to get much help from anywhere these days. 

But if you were using Mac OS X, something like :

> read.csv(file="/Users/ThorJ/Desktop/heightweight.csv"

I would expect to work.  the path you can find the in the file Information.

FWIW, if you are using the GUI or the terminal, you can type in the 

read.csv(file='

and then drag the file you want to read into the command line, whereupon by the magic that I don't really need to understand it will populate the line with the correct path, then you can add the final quote and the bracket.

but in future, read the posting guide, provide at least the output of the sessionInfo() command and maybe a minimal code example. If it's relevant, consider upgrading to Mac OS X.

good luck

Ben

You could also simplify the path using teh '~' symbol

read.csv(file="~/Desktop/heightweight.csv")

One really slick way to get properly constructed paths is to drag the  
file to the console. An example of the results of doing so on my system:

/Users/davidwinsemius/Desktop/Lecture.schedule.txt

As you can see, you don't need the volume name for the default volume  
and you would probably be better off using "/"'s.

Here is an example of a path to a mounted CD:

/Volumes/VFF0664/SILKYPIX/SILKYPIX Developer Studio 3.1 SE Installer.pkg

You can also drop the path directly into R.app: just hold down the option key when you drop a file into the console

I  usually just type:

twinData        = read.spss("", use.value.labels=T, to.data.frame=T, max.value.labels=Inf, trim.factor.names=F)

then option-drop the file in between the awaiting empty quotes.

...and while we are at this long thread about trivial things, another simple alternative in the GUI is to use file.choose() 

twinData        = read.spss(file.choose(), use.value.labels=T, to.data.frame=T, max.value.labels=Inf, trim.factor.names=F)

Hello everyone,

Thanks a ton to everyone on this thread.  Apologies for breaking
posting etiquette - this was my first post.

I got it to work using a few different suggestions, the only thing is
the my .csv file is appearing in R as separated by semicolons.  The
column headings are separated only by a period, preventing me from
manipulating the data.  For example:

> Test=read.csv(file="~/Desktop/heightweight.csv")
Message d'avis :
In read.table(file = file, header = header, sep = sep, quote = quote,  :
  readTableHeader a trouv? une ligne finale incompl?te dans
'~/Desktop/heightweight.csv'
> Test
  Height.Weight
1       200;180
2       180;170
3       160;130
4       210;200
> Test$Height
[1] 200;180 180;170 160;130 210;200
Levels: 160;130 180;170 200;180 210;200
> Test$Weight
NULL
>

I have been using the above .csv file to learn the R program before
importing a much larger data set, some three thousand rows long.
Thanks again for all the inputs, and if I am using the thread
incorrectly feel free to say so.  Not intending to abuse the service.

Many thanks,

Thor

Use an editor to change the period in the header to a semi-colon and  
then use read.csv2()

Is it possible that the columns are separated by semicolons in the file. Can you open the .csv file in a text editor? Right click and choose open with ... and use textedit or bbedit or textmate or something?

if so, if you read the help page (use ?read.csv) you will see that you can specify the separator in the command (sep=';' might work) or you could actually use the read.csv2 command (you will see that it defaults to the semicolon)

test <- read.csv2(file="~/Desktop/heightweight.csv")

another useful command that isn't always apparent to beginners is the str command, ie :

str(test)

good luck again.

cheers

Ben

Brilliant!

That did it, the .csv2 worked!  Simple fix for a simple project that
had me blocked.

Thanks for the other tips as well, I'll look into str() now.

Best wishes,

Thor

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] How to free up system memory?
Message-ID: <4DBF3E20.7020605@witthoft.com>

I'm not sure exactly what's happening, so I'll try to describe the steps 
in detail.  I get the same behavior with R 2.12.1 and R 2.13, OSX 10.6.6 
or 10.6.4 .

First, I boot up Activity Monitor and set it to show memory usage.

I create a large object (in the R Console of R.app GUI) , such as

foo<-runif(1e8)

and the "real memory" in the table and "active memory" in the pie chart 
go up.  No surprise.

Then I get rid of foo,

rm(foo)

But the memory allocations don't change.   Looks like a memory leak?

Two other things I found:

1) If I write a function that does nothing but create some big objects 
like that, and then deletes them,  ActivityMonitor shows memory 
allocated to R and then freed up.  This is what I'd expect from the 
R.app GUI as well.

2) If I boot several other applications, using up all my RAM, at some 
point the operating system moves some of R's active memory into virtual 
memory.  Now the funny thing:  if I make R the foreground app, or if I 
simply quit all the other apps,  R does not get its active memory 
allocation back.  The 'pie chart' shows memory has been freed, not just 
"inactive" .

Did I set some bad parameter in one of my config files?  Is there some 
way within R to force all that memory to be freed up (other than 
quitting and restarting R)?

Thanks for your help -- I'm not the least put out if someone wants to 
point out what a dummy I'm being.

  Unlikely.  Much more likely, garbage collection simply hasn't cleaned up the memory yet.  Read "?gc".

  For whatever reason, gc() happens earlier in one case than in the other.  This is all internal implementation detail; it's nothing to worry about.  If you want to force memory to be cleaned up earlier than R would do it on its own, you can always call gc() yourself.

> 2) If I boot several other applications, using up all my RAM, at some point the operating system moves some of R's active memory into virtual memory.  Now the funny thing:  if I make R the foreground app, or if I simply quit all the other apps,  R does not get its active memory allocation back.  The 'pie chart' shows memory has been freed, not just "inactive" .

  Perhaps the memory that got purged was available for garbage collection, and got collected.  Or perhaps it was caches that got cleared.  Who knows.  Unless something is actually malfunctioning, it is not worth worry about memory usage like this.  There are many reasons why you might see these kinds of patterns, and they are all implementation details.

  Call gc() if you want.  Or just relax.  :->

  No worries, it confused me when I started, too.

One more test: quite by accident, after typing

rm(foo)

I invoked the help function, i.e.

?matrix  (or ?anything_valid)

and R freed up most of the memory allocated to foo.   Hope this helps.

	PPC ONLY
Message-ID: <EE71744A5D4CAB41B4B30CEE7E681045D09A457EA6@COTTUS.ttu.edu>

After upgrade to R2.13.0 on powerpc-apple-darwin9.8.0/ppc (32-bit) on OSX10.5.8, very predictable and repeatable freezing of R.app GUI 1.40 occurs (spinning ball). This does not seem to occur when running R from Terminal.app. The freezing seems associated with what should be simple syntax errors. All other features seem to be working expect "Show function hints" at the bottom of GUI is grey. All my "syntax error free" code seems to parse and run just fine via source() or cut and paste.

Here is an example that freezes every time.
rm(production) # does not matter whether production existed or not
summary(production)

Here in another example that freezes every time
x <- rnorm(100)
y <- rnorm(100) + abs(x)
z <- rnorm(100) + y^2
lm(z~x y)

Here in another example the freezes every time
asdf;j(d)

I have no shortage of other examples. Apparently any syntax error hangs the GUI, and termination of the process via opt-cmd-esc or via shell is only solution.

I upgraded an intel box at same time and can report no similar behavior.

I've also noticed this behaviour on my PPC
(powerpc-apple-darwin9.8.0/ppc (32-bit)), and have reverted to 2.12.2
until I can figure out the problem. Since the command-line R seems
fine, I assumed the problem was with the R.app GUI too.

   Try working your way to the file interactively within R using

(fn <- file.choose())

  and see what R thinks the file is really called.

On a Mac that can be confusing since there are so many links (try 
finding files under /tmp for example).

Assuming this is Mac OS X, the file is most likely called 
"/Users/ThorJ/Desktop/heightweight.csv": Classic MacOS (which used :) 
was last supported several years ago.

If you use file.choose() then the Mac opens a search window where you 
can type in partial name of the file (heightweight) and it will find 
all files with the name of heightweight.  Select the one you want.

An alternative to reading csv file directly is to read them from 
Excel (or OpenOffice), copy them to the clipboard and then

library(psych)
my.data <- read.clipboard.csv()

Can you, please, be more specific as of what you expect to see and what you don't see? The hints work just fine for me. Also note that the preference setting applies to the editor, not the console (which shows hints at all times unless R is busy).

Cheers,
Simon

There is a lot of missing pieces, but I bet that your package links unversioned libatlas-MacPro.dylib instead of libRblas.dylib and you don't have the appropriate symlinks in x86_64. (Just for the record: this is "your mileage may vary" setup and is NOT what you get when you install R). There are several solutions:

a) switch back to R BLAS when building your package (this is the default in "normal" R)

b) make a symlink from to all sub-arch directories (i386, x86_64 possibly ppc) to libatlas-MacPro.dylib. This is a just a hack - your binaries won't work on anyone else's machines.

c) add versioned path to your libatlas-MacPro.dylib using install_name_tool -id, preferably pointing to libRblas and NOT the MacPro variant, i.e. for R 2.13.x:
install_name_tool -id /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.13/Resources/lib/libRblas.dylib libatlas-MacPro.dylib

Cheers,
Simon

Simon,

Robert is referring (I suspect) to those wonderful hints at the 
bottom of the console window that tell what the function parameters 
are.

Yes, hints work fine on most of my machines, but do not on an iMac 
running OS 10.5.8 that I recently installed in my lab.  (I am at home 
and can not do a sessionInfo on my lab machine right now.)

For me, the hints line flashes when R is first loading and then is 
never to be seen again.

This happens on the iMac for 2.13.0 as well as 2.14.0  and with RGui 
1.40 and 1.41  (this is from memory).

Bill

It's also happening as described by Bill on an OSX 10.5.8 machine with  
R version 2.13.0 beta (2011-04-04 r55296) running with the R64 GUI  
that came as a bundle from the att.research site. I figured I had  
forgotten how to set an option. I just tried with the 32 bit GUI and  
get the same lack of earlier behavior (.... display of argument list  
at bottom of GUI window when function name is followed by "(". at the  
command line) . And tried with the terminal version and it doesn't  
have the grey border so there would have been no place to display that  
information.

G'day Simon,

two quick little bits of feedback - I just upgraded to 2.13.0 on Friday.

Absolutely totally love the the Command-Enter in the help files to get the demo code into the console. I've honestly thought about this about five million times since I started using R in any format. Every single time I've copied, switched window and pasted. This is just brilliant. Thank you very much for this enhancement. 

Second - I've noticed that if I go to Console or Syntax preferences, clicking subsequently on Show all makes the Colour picker appear. Clicking on any pane then makes it go away again. Obviously, very minor issue!

thanks again for all the work on this. 

cheers

Ben

Oh, and I forgot to mention, it looks like you've really nailed the automatic brackets - fantastic - I really did delay too long on the upgrade. Even RGeos just worked - no more gpclibPermit() - oh yay!

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Dependent variable of left and right hand sides
Message-ID: <BANLkTinJFeOGTDm_fmGX=mTu+DPtpGUYfQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

An R squared novice with a trouble regression.  Some brief background:
I am looking for a relationship between energy efficiency (based on
certification level) against various independent variables - including
heating and cooling days, region (11 Canadian provinces), and soon
energy prices.

Writing out all the variables into my equation using "monkey$Level" or
renaming them all using "Level=monkey$Level" seemed too much so I just
represented the equation side using "lm(monkey$Level~."  The trouble
is my dependent variable  is listed among the other independent
variables on the right hand side.  Is this because I am using
"monkey$level~." instead of renaming the variables via Y=monkey$Level
and then writing Y~X1..Xn?

> summary(fm<-lm(monkey$Level~., data=df))   # monkey is a csv2 read file, and df is my data frame with ten dummy variables and two ordinary integer variables
Call:
lm(formula = monkey$Level ~ ., data = df)

Message-ID: <4DC85D88.5050606@education.wisc.edu>

Greetings,

I'm finding it difficult to load various packages from the CRAN to my 
Mac.  I've tried different mirror sites and that doesn't seem to help.  
Typically, I get the pinwheel of death and have to force quit.  What I 
seem to notice in each case is a message that says "error: package 
"proxy" could not be loaded".  I'm not sure that is relevant to the 
problem, but any suggestions would be appreciated.

Thanks in advance,

David, more information would be useful. Are you using the menu, or R
command line? What exactly are you doing/typing? What's your
sessionInfo()? Are you sure you have Internet connectivity, and if yes
can you read.table from an online source?

Regards
Ben

Hi,

this was a bug in the regex engine used by R.app for MacOSX 10.5.x (32bit).
We fixed it in the devs.

Thanks a lot for pointing it out,

Message-ID: <42EC90D4-2AE1-4572-9053-80988466E101@gmail.com>

Is there a way that I can have multiple console windows running for the same instance of R.app/R64.app? I've sometimes found in other IDEs that it can be handy to have this feature, such as Macintosh Common Lisp's ability to have multiple listener windows going for the same instance of MCL.

Cheers,

Currently, no. I have a separate project (RemoteR) in progress that allows remote connection to an R instance with multiplexing support, but it's not ready for prime time yet (it can do console but I still need to extend the Quartz support).

That said, it is fairly easy to chain messages from the console, so it would be easy to write a plug-in infrastructure that would allow you to register additional windows, IPC or whatever you want. Let me know if you're interested - it would be only a few lines of code on our side and you could add listeners, for example, using the Cocoa package ( http://rforge.net/Cocoa/ ).

Cheers,
Simon

This seems like a cool project. I'll be looking for it.

I don't have any Obj-C experience, but this seems like it's in the direction of what I want. Thanks, Simon.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Paranthesis highlighting
Message-ID: <80F89F50-AF7C-4179-ADDA-CDE9E01D147C@cognition.uni-freiburg.de>

Dear list,

is it just me or is everybody experiencing this?
Since the upgrade to R 2.13.0 on my Mac (OS X 10.6.7, R GUI 1.40 (5751)) the highlighting of matching parantheses doesn't work the way it used to. It doesn't highlight the matching parantheses while typing, but it still does while scrolling over it with the cursor with the arrow keys. This is quite inconvenient since I have to go back after each bracket if I want to know which one's the matching bracket.

I experience this problem with every kind of bracket (round, curly ...).

I really like the built-in Mac OS editor for R, so I hope this will be fixed soon or I can easily fix it myself.

Thanks,
Sascha W.

Hi Sascha,

sorry, we lost that functionality while re-factoring the entire editor code. I've just fixed it.

Thanks a lot the hint!

Do you have the following in a .bash_profile, or some equivalent?:

export PATH=/Library/Frameworks/GDAL.framework/Programs:$PATH
export PATH=/Library/Frameworks/PROJ.framework/Programs:$PATH
export PATH=/Library/Frameworks/SQLite3.framework/Programs:$PATH
export PATH=/Library/Frameworks/UnixImageIO.framework/Programs:$PATH

(at least the first and second will be needed)

Alternatively, see:
http://www.kyngchaos.com/macosx/notes/shell

I suspect that rgdal will not install successfully unless an R session
is able to "see" GDAL and probably also PROJ.4

Agustin,

I was having some problems a few days ago using these binaries, and it was due to one of the Frameworks in the GDAL complete being out of date... you could try downloading all the individual ones to see if that helps.

cheers

Ben

Why do you suspect so?  rgdal does not call the GDAL nor PROJ4 nor 
SQLite3 programs.  If you dynamically link, you may need their library 
directories on the dylib search path (but you can statically link).

I think the rest of us will need to wait a few decades to see R13 (and 
the R posting guide asks you to be accurate about versions).  For R 
2.13.0 there is a statically linked binary of rgdal on CRAN extras, 
and you can ask about it on the appropriate list, r-sig-geo.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Where are my packages?
Message-ID: <637659C5-F1B9-4551-8207-CBA8EB809684@rpi.edu>

I just upgraded to 2.13 from 2.12.

As far as I can figure things are working well except that none of the packages I downloaded for 2.12 are available to 2.13. That would not be an issue as it is easy to download packages as needed. I can do this and they work.

What is the issue is that I don't know where they are being stored. The ones for 2.12 are here:

/Users/wgray/Library/R/2.12/library

2.13 created a similar directory but there is nothing in it.

In the Preferences for 2.13 I do have the box checked to make  ~/Library/R... the default path (as per the screen shot attached to this email but probably stripped out by the listserv software). And, yes, I have restarted my machine several times since this was checked (I think I set this two days ago).

So stuff is somewheres as the package install when I load them. I would like to know (a) where they are, (b) how I can get them to go into the ~/Library/R... directory, and (c) whether it is prudent and reasonable to move everything that is in the 2.12 library into the 2.13 library.

Thanks

You can have packages two places
  (1) system wide
  (2) user specific
The packages that ship with R always install system wide which is why
- when you look in your user specific packages - you don't see any.

You need to reinstall the packages for 2.13.  You cannot just copy the
directories.  You can use the directory to figure out which packages
you did install.

If you simply want to re-install the same packages you had, it's as simple as

install.packages(row.names(installed.packages("~/Library/R/2.12/library")))

Cheers,

So you have downloaded what you need?
How did you install?
With the GUI?

See section 5.2 of the R For Mac OS X FAQ. It explains it all.

You seem to be running the R GUI.
From the menu select Packages & Data, Package Installer.
Choose CRAN (binaries) for Packages repository (assuming you want binaries).
In the search box (on the righthand side of the panel) click on the little triangle.
Click on Select packages from R2.12. <=====  that's the magic
(You may also have to click on Get List).
Click on Update All.

I hope that I got this right (it's what I did when updating from 2.12 to 2.13)

That works (and is designed to work) on the system level, it doesn't look into your user-level packages.

It usually indicates a problem in your fonts - broken or duplicate fonts. Often going to the Font Book and checking for duplicate or invalid fonts (in particular Arial here) solves the issue.

No, Quartz uses Apple's font frameworks, not FontConfig. However, fixing the font issue in your system should be the more preferable solution.

You can simply use
par(family="sans")
to do that, but, again, fixing your font setup will likely have more lasting effect.

Only in base graphics for the current device.  Calling 
quartz.options() is preferable (and can be done in startup files). 
But why are we helping someone who cannot be bothered to read the help 
page or the list archives ....

Berend,

Many thanks for your note. Of the ones that were sent yours was the most useful. I can now find my packages even if I don't know why they are in the /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/library directory rather than in the /Library/R/2.12/library.

Even better, I was able to use your tip to update all of my packages from 2.12 to 2.13.

Yours,

Wayne Gray

Because in the R.framework tree is where they are _supposed_ to be:

Message-ID: <23292B0B-0329-454C-9A17-5BB1CCB45337@une.edu.au>

Hi,

I've been running rgdal, RColorBrewer, maptools, classInt, spdep, gpclib, raster, zoo, cluster and lattice in R2.12 on Mac OSX 10.6.7 for the last 6 months with no problems.  Today I installed R 2.13.0, and downloaded the latest versions of the above packages.  Most of them load without problems, but class (a depend of classInt), and deldir (a depend of spdep) failed to load.  The error message is of the form:

-------------------------------
Loading required package: class
Error in dyn.load(file, DLLpath = DLLpath, ...) : 
  unable to load shared object '/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.13/Resources/library/class/libs/x86_64/class.so':
  dlopen(/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.13/Resources/library/class/libs/x86_64/class.so, 6): Library not loaded: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.12/Resources/lib/libR.dylib
  Referenced from: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.13/Resources/library/class/libs/x86_64/class.so
  Reason: image not found
Error: package 'class' could not be loaded
-------------------------------

The problem seems to be either the package is looking in the wrong place (a subdirectory of 2.12 instead of a subdirectory of 2.13) for the file libR.dylib, or the install of R failed to put the files that package class needs in the 2.12 directory.  In the case of deldir, the errant file is libgfortran.2.dylib.

I can get  package class to load without error by taking a copy of libR.dylib from the subdirectory of 2.13 and putting it in the subdirectory of 2.12 where class  expects it to be.

I'm concerned this might be a stupid short-term fix, as calls to the functions in class might also fail due to other files not being in the expected places.

Can anyone suggest any leads to other approaches I could take to get these previously trouble-free packages to behave themselves in R 2.13?

Thank you.

Maybe, but this is about the recommended package 'class'.  In the CRAN 
distribution oF R 2.13.0

tystie% otool -L 
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.13/Resources/library/class/libs/x86_64/class.so
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.13/Resources/library/class/libs/x86_64/class.so:
 	class.so (compatibility version 0.0.0, current version 0.0.0)

/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.13/Resources/lib/libR.dylib 
(compatibility version 2.13.0, current version 2.13.0)

/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreFoundation.framework/Versions/A/CoreFoundation 
(compatibility version 150.0.0, current version 476.19.0)
 	/usr/lib/libgcc_s.1.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, 
current version 1.0.0)
 	/usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, 
current version 111.1.5)

So class.so is linked to the correct libR.dylib.

Something odd has happened on Ian Reeve's system, and I suspect that a 
binary copy of 'class' built for R 2.12.x has been installed into 
2.13.0.

I suggest at a minimum running

update.packages(checkBuilt=TRUE)

and if the problems persist a complete clear out and re-install.

Ian,
I agree with Brian. I checked the CRAN binaries of class and deldir and they are correctly linking to 2.13, so I suspect you have old packages in your tree. I don't think this can happen with stock R binary, it seems that at some point you moved packages or there is/was a symlink between some libraries of 2.12 and 2.13. If the latter is true, to avoid future issues I would suggest 
sudo rm -rf /Library/Frameworks/R.framework
and re-installing R.

Cheers,
Simon

Thanks Brian and Simon for the suggestions.

update.packages(checkBuilt=TRUE)

fixed the load problem and all the functions I was using in R 2.12 are running identically in R 2.13.0.

For future reference, when I update to a new version of R, is it good practice to:

sudo rm -rf /Library/Frameworks/R.framework

and then download and install the contributed packages one needs?  Otherwise, does the installing process for the base R package look at what is already there in R.framework tree and retain the contributed packages that were installed under the previous version?

Thanks Brian, Carl and Simon for your prompt assistance - it's very much appreciated.

Regards
Ian

Usually, it is not needed. Just your setup seemed very unusual so it asked for radical measures ;) (libraries are separate for each major version so what you encountered does not happen in the default R setup).

Normally you just install new R and then use Package Manager to install packages to match your previous version. If you blow away old R, you will have no track of packages you installed before.

Cheers,
Simon

It's really odd that people blog about their own inefficient scripts 
rather than read the R documentation.

Because this scripts checks (very inefficiently) if a package is 
already installed, it would not solve the problem discussed in this 
thread.  And install.packages() takes a vector of packages, and 
'survival' is a recommended package and should always be installed.

Because people have differing needs there are different ways to do 
this.  But the ideas of

http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/rw-FAQ.html#What_0027s-the-best-way-to-upgrade_003f

suit many.

Well, that's a bit convoluted way (I really don't see the point of that "script") - if you want to re-install packages across R versions (not the topic of this thread!) it is far easier than that and I posted it here just a few days ago:

# for packages from user location:
install.packages(row.names(installed.packages("~/Library/R/2.12/library")))

# for packages from system location:
install.packages(row.names(installed.packages("/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.12/Resources/library")))

but as I said, the Package Manager gives you the latter without the need to type anything ...

Cheers,
Simon

I've been in the habit of keeping all the .tgz files in a directory and using that as a guide for installing packages in the new R.  So I'm happy to trash the old R.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] install.packages: location of system-wide library tree
Message-ID: <5B9313E1-E348-4444-A996-A8BB60421FF8@gmail.com>

Dear expeRts,

On (my?) macs, .libPaths() contains two entries, with the first pointing to a user's library tree and the second to the system-wide library tree, as in

## begin code
v <- getRversion()
userLib <- Sys.glob(sprintf("~/Library/R/%s.%s/library", v$major, v$minor))
systemLib <- sprintf("/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/%s.%s/Resources/library", v$major, v$minor)
userLib == .libPaths()[1]
systemLib == .libPaths()[2]
# both return TRUE (on my system)
## end code

When installing new packages, I would like to make them available to all users. However, the 'lib' parameter of 'install.packages' defaults to the first element of '.libPaths()'. How do I reliably specify the location of the system library: Is it always equal to '.libPaths()[-1]'? And why is '.Library.site' empty? 

Jochen

.Library.site becomes not empty when you create a site library, for example by
  mkdir  {PATH to R}/R/lib64/site-library
(of course lib64 assumes a 64 bit architecture)

No, you got it completely backwards! The script you referred to is useless in that case (and I told you that you are entirely off topic with that!), it has nothing to do with R. There is no "bug" in R mentioned anywhere in the thread, so you are really inventing things here. Please *do* read the e-mails you are receiving.

Thanks,
Simon

Hi all,
I wonder if there could be a way to allow querys like the following to succeed by changes to the gui command line?

Just surround the topic with quotes:

?">"

and 

?"%in%"


This is covered in ?help:

"Some topics need to be quoted (by backticks) or given as a character string. There include those which cannot syntactically appear on their own such as unary and binary operators, function and control-flow reserved words (including if, elsefor, in, repeat, while, break and next. The other reserved words can be used as if they were names, for example TRUE, NA and Inf."

HTH.

Thanks Mark and Ian,
Glad it?s a straightforward and memorable workaround. And this is easy in the new GUI (which adds quotes around a selection. Still wish that the error told me that was a likely cause: I just assumed it was impossible to search on.

Followup GUI query: Is there a was to go to the beginning of the command line directly? My method is to cmd-right select the line, then use right arrow to fall off the end of the selection leaving the cursor at the start (ready to type a ?)

This fails: The right arrow just does nothing?

As cmd-shift-? opens help, a lovely enhancement would be for cmd-cntrl-? to execute ?rGUISelection

Then help would be just a matter of select and keystroke, with no need to delete the? or pollute the history.

EnjoyR,
tim

cntrl-a works for me on the GUI and I suspect on a terminal console  
session as well, since I have been told that it is a UNIX convention.

Command-left arrow
Ctrl-A

And you can create a DefaultKeyBinding.dict in the directory ~/Library/Keybindings with  a mapping of the Home to the Cocoa cursor command "moveToBeginningOfLine:".
See http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~jrus/site/cocoa-text.html

For example, if you have a DefaultKeyBinding.dict file containing

{
    /* home  Shift+home*/
    "\UF729"  = "moveToBeginningOfLine:";
    "$\UF729" = "moveToBeginningOfLineAndModifySelection:";

    /* end  Shift+end*/
    "\UF72B"  = "moveToEndOfLine:";
    "$\UF72B" = "moveToEndOfLineAndModifySelection:";
}

Home will move the cursor to the start of a line
End  will move the cursor to the end of a line

Combined with a  shift key, these will select from the current cursor position to the start/end of line.

Again, thanks for the help: I think it is a bug that left-arrow does not deselect the selection and leave the cursor immediately to the left of the old selection. having hte left-arrow move left is completely standard on mac applications., where as control-A is Unix only.

thanks again for the replies,

If this is because you have an Apple laptop,  Fn left-arrow and Fn right-arrow are Home and End respectively.

Not on my machine in the GUI. Goes to top or bottom of the console

To get the behaviour I described you have to have a DefaultKeyBinding.dict with the appropriate key definitions.
Otherwise indeed Home/End go to top/end of text/window.

What Berend meant is that if you want to re-define the behavior to be non-standard with the modifications he listed (which you cut out), you can have it behave that way. It is not the default or intended behavior, though. (Windows users may be more used to it which is presumably why he mentioned it).

Just to re-iterate, the standard Mac way to go to the beginning of the line is <Cmd><Left>. The standard Mac way to move up a paragraph is <Alt><Up> (which is equivalent to going to the beginning of a paragraph except when you are already there). There is an emacs equivalent <Ctrl><A> which goes to the beginning of the paragraph.

Now, in fact he GUI behaves slightly differently, but no one noticed ;). Due to the special treatment of the prompt, the commands concerning the beginnings of things have special work-arounds, so for example beginning of the line equals beginning of the paragraph in the GUI. However, this is what people most commonly want, so I'm not sure it's abad thing. I'll see if I can make the behavior consistent, though.

Cheers,
Simon

PS: I looked in the help menu and saw nothing like ?help on selection cntrl-H? ?. that would help with newbie discovery (like me :-) )

Would be great: it is unusual not to be able to left-arrow out of a selection. Maybe I can get used to Cmd?left-arrow to go to beginning of line: I think I use the shift key to highlight so I can attend the new location of the cursor more easily.

Hi all,
Fantastic that the revamped editor has variable finding (type yourData$ then tab if you have not already)!!

I often find still, however, that in a workflow I repeatedly run "names(myData)? because I can?t remember how a variable is named in a data set.

I think Workspace Browser is underused in this respect: It actually replaces a lot of the visual benefit that a spreadsheet offers for thinking about dataFrame).

Workspace Browser could become even more widely used and helpful if it had:
   1. A filter like the lovely history browser
    2. Sortable by object, type, structure, (and preferably size for spotting space hogs)

Wishlist? :-)

I had not. That _is_ a nice surprise. It might be more user-friendly  
if logic could be installed that detects when the window is at the  
bottom of the screen (as I generally set up my display) because the  
scroll is currently only "drop-down" (which disappears) and it would  
be nice if it would "drop-up". Or perhaps a preference switch that  
could be "up" or "down"?

I generally use (at the console window):

  grep(patt, names(dfrm), value=TRUE)

... since I have 100-200 names per dataframe and I only want to see  
the 5- 15 names that have a particular two or three letter string in  
them.

And look at that.... clickable arrows to expand tables and dataframes!

I had overlooked that search window at the top of the History panel.  
NICE.

I guess that is the grep functionality.

Thanks for educating me and thanks to Simon and Hans-Joerg and anyone  
else whose work contributes to the Mac version and the GUI improvements.

For the records the Mac GUI now makes usage of the rcompgen package AND it's configurable (see ?rcompgen).

If there's enough space under the current edited line it will come up as "drop-down" otherwise, if the RConsole window is at the bottom of the screen, it'll come up as "drop-up". In future I would like to replace the standard Mac completion approach by a self-written "narrow-down-while-typing-list", maybe including the chance to customise its appearance; and maybe to implement a kind of auto-completion. Be patient ;)

Good point. Maybe we're able to improve the Workspace browser for such tasks...

For the records it's bound to key equivalent ??H and it makes usage of Mac's ICU regex engine implemented via Cocoa's NSPredicate, ergo similar to grep :)

For me running R 2.13.0 beta under OSX 10.5.8 with GUI 1.41 (5800)  
x86_64-apple-darwin9.8.0,  it still only "drops-down", (and  
effectively disappears) even when I make a special effort to bump the  
console border against the bottom of my screen. (There had been a  
small gap when I tried it before). But maybe this difference in  
behavior is because I have not yet seen sufficient reason to take my  
Leopard onto Snow country.

On the other hand I discovered that I can replace much of my grepping  
if I know the starting letters. AND I can then "arrow-scroll" through  
the more constrained choices. Nice.

I guess I would have thought that the default should be to "drop-up"  
since one would be expected to be typing near the bottom of the  
screen. Just a thought. I was reasonably happy with just grepping at  
the command line.  Please take my thanks for everything done to  
improve this platform. You guys are doing a great job of supporting us  
for very little pay, so I very much hope your respective organizations  
are treating you well.

It's nor our call - it's not us actually creating and any drop-down or up - it's your system (we are only providing the list of completion strings) so the behavior appears to be a bug in the OS that has been fixed in Snow Leopard. So, as Hans said, until we create our own custom completion UI (which he suggested) you get what your system gives you  ;).

Cheers,
Simon
