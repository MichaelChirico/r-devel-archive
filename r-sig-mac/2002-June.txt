Message-ID: <BF44EB37-770D-11D6-A548-003065E01564@pasteur.fr>

Hello,

I have been trying to compile R sources in order to use it in java 
programs. So I have read in the FAQ for the R-Java Interface that R 
should be built as a shared library (libR.so) by adding to the ./compile 
command " --enable-R-shlib.

As a result, I have tried to install it in the unix way proposed but it 
generated a lot of errors. Then I have tried to install it as it is 
adviced in the R-1.5.0 -> src ->macintosh-> Install, but it occured to 
be so difficult that I didn't manage to do what they explain.

So did someone succeed in installing R as a shared library that migth 
take time to explain me in a simple way how to do this.

Thanks a lot.

Laetitia

what is inside src/macintosh/INSTALL refers to the Carbon build of R. 
This port of R cannot be built as a shared library.

Jan de Leeuw is probably the one who can help you with the Darwin 
version (the unix way). I never built R as a shared library, sorry.

Darwin is Unix. What you have to do is work from the command line (in theTerminal
application). You first download the the Apple Developer tools (compilers and so
on) from www.apple.com/developer. Then you download R using, for instance,

rsync -rvC rsync.r-project.org::r-devel foo/foo

where foo/foo is the directory where you want it. Then use

configure --with-tcl-config=/sw/lib/tclConfig.sh --with-tk-config=/sw/lib/tkConfig.sh  --enable-R-shlib

This only works if you have installed g77, tcltk, dlcompat from fink.sourceforge.net.
Alternatively, you can install fink first (see the instructions on the site), and then
simply say "fink install r-base". This will download all that is needed, compile,
and install R-1.5.0 (but without shared library support, I think).

Instead of these painful processes, you can also download a version of R with
support for tcl/tk and gnome from ftp://gifi.stat.ucla.edu/pub/R-1.5.0. This also has
support for atlas, and it has libR.dylib (the shared library). It comes with over
200 precompiled packages.

But it does not have SJava yet, because Duncan is still working on that port. It
does have RPython and RSPerl.

	Rmpi, brlr, RandomFields

The R.tar.gz has support for both gnome (with the relevant fink
dylibs) and ATLAS, but observe that ATLAS is optimized for the
machine it compiles on. The ATLAS in that binary is optimized for
my Cube, which means a 450MHz single-processor machine
with 256MB of memory.

Also, it is of some interest that the g77 that comes with fink and that
is used in compiling the ATLAS in fink does not work anymore with
the April 2002 version of the developer tools (and not with Jaguar
and the Jaguar tools either).

Shocking, but probably true. What I'll do is make a package to install all the components
in the appropriate places (including the dylibs). It will take a couple of days, because
using gcc-3.1 and Jaguar give FORTRAN troubles (who would have thought we would
still complain about FORTRAN troubles in 2002). In fact, I'll make a meta-package,
with the recommended and contributed R packages in separate OS X packages.

Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.10.10206171741300.18405-100000@fisher.stat.ucla.edu>

With the growing adoption of OS X and the soon-to-be discontinued Carbon
version of R, I have a question about how packages will continue to be
distributed for the Macintosh version of R.  This question arose from some
discussions over developing a GUI for Macintosh R and perhaps
incorporating a rudimentary "package manager".

Currently, it seems that for the Carbon version, one must rely on
precompiled binary versions of the packages (.sit files) due to the
scarcity of development tools on Mac OS < X. The situation here is similar
to that of the Windows platform where packages are precompiled and
downloaded as .zip files.  While compilation of source packages on either
of these platforms is far from impossible, it is not entirely
straightforward and probably out of the realm of the average R user.

On the other hand, Unix users, with the exception of a few Linux
distributions, must essentially build R from source and install packages
from source.  However, if the user's installation of Unix has a working
development environment (i.e. C, Fortran compiler, Perl, etc.), and most
do, then this can be very straightforward.  Similarly, given a good R
installation, Unix users can use install.packages() and friends to
install, update (and compile) packages.  Forcing (even casual) Unix users
to rely on this setup does not seem to cause a huge problem.

For the Darwin/X11/Quartz version of R, it seems that we are (perhaps
unnecessarily?) taking the Carbon/Windows approach, with Jan building
compiled versions of all the packages (as well as R itself).  My question
is are we going to continue this approach to package distribution or
should we abandon the precompilation method and just let users build
packages from source?  With gcc, g77, perl, latex, etc. appearing on OS X
it seems that we could allow the package distribution setup for OS X
mirror more closely that of the standard Unix platform.

That would be nice, no more binaries. In fact, I stopped building
them, telling everybody to use fink, but it seems very few people
actually listened. And using the fink version of R is less flexible,
of course. Other problems with no-binaries:

-- typical Macintosh users are proud to stay away from the command line
-- more is needed than the Apple Development tools (i.e.
     from fink we need dlcompat, X11, gnome perhaps)
-- the Apple DevTools are changing rapidly and have various
     incompatibilities (the December 2001 tools, the April 2002
     tools, the Jaguar Tools)
-- as a consequence the developer must choose between
     various versions of gcc and g77 or f2c
--  does the typical user know about ATLAS ? Another choice.
-- no-more-binaries implies that the typical R user has the 
     DevTools installed (and maintains a personal version of
     fink)
-- it seems to me that for other Unixes R and its packages are
    also distributed as binaries (for the same reason). Every Unix
    distribution must provide binaries of the recommended
    packages
-- packages in the Carbon version  are binaries because the
     typical R user does not know (and probably cannot be
     asked to know) how to build shared libraries on the OS 9
     platform. tools (MPW, CodeWarrior) are readily available.
-- many of the packages depend on other libraries (netpbm,
     hdf5, MySQL, MPI, PVM, and so on) being present. Again, often
    fink comes to the rescue, but the user needs to maintain all this in
     fink
-- building some of the OmegaHat packages is far from
     easy, and can perhaps never be made easy
-- the Darwin/X11 distribution is already like all other
     Unix distributions, except that I provide a ridiculous
     number of binaries
-- next week I will have OS X installer packages for the
     whole thing, and users only need to know how to
     double=click, and only have to deal with a single
     installer file.
-- with the Quartz device and the Cocoa interfaces things
     will become easier for the user, but harder for the developer
     (need to know more stuff, need to have more stuff)

Now eventually the DevTools and OS X itself will stabilize, and
the various configure problems will be worked out (currently,
ATLAS does not build properly with the April tools and gcc2 with
its g77, and R does not build with gcc3 and its g77). Then
things will become much easier, and many more people will
roll their own. Especially when they are happy with X11 and
the command line. And that's good, because making your own
provides a better understanding of the whole environment and
allows you to optimize towards your own machine and your own
needs.

You only have to click a few times. It installs base R-1.5.1 in /usr/local
and some essential dylibs in /sw/lib. It assumes you have X11 installed,
and it does not provide the dylibs (yet) for gnome and some of the
non-standard packages. These will be added in future versions. For
all your X11 needs on OS X, start with

http://wrench.et.ic.ac.uk/adrian/software/oroborusx

If you are running OS X 10.2 (Jaguar) do not install this, the dylibs are
for 10.1.x.

Thanks! It would also be helpful if the installer could correctly set 
the path in a login file, so that typing "R" will run the last version 
installed. Fink uses different file locations than what you recommend, 
and that gave me some problems when I tried to upgrade to 1.5.0, which 
was not available from Fink.

I have built and uploaded to CRAN the Carbon version of R for 
MacOS/MacOSX.

You'll find the base set (rm151.sit) and the recommended packages 
(recommended.sit) separately or all in one single file (rm151_FULL.sit) 
on CRAN and their mirrors soon.

I have also built the Bioconductor suite of packages (corresponding to 
the Bioconductor_1.0.tgz file) as it seems to be one of the most 
appealing packages for Mac users.

You'll find it in the macos/contrib/rm151  folder on CRAN.

Other packages will follow.

This version of R contains a fully working methods library.

I switched to fink, but then when the release of v1.5.0 on fink 
lagged behind its release on every other platform by several weeks, I 
kind of lost enthusiasm for that approach. And, as far as I could 
tell, a variety of packages from fink unstable were needed, and that 
also dampened my enthusiasm.

This is a consideration, but S is, after all, a _programming_ 
language, so putting a lot of effort into serving folks who don't 
want to use a command line may be an exercise in futility.

I'll say. I build R from sources on Solaris, and that includes having 
had to first install GCC, tcltk, png, jpeg, readlines, and libz, also 
from sources. And all of them in non-standard locations. But I have 
not yet succeeded in building R (Darwin) from sources on OS X, 
despite help from folks on R-SIG-Mac.

There are lots of things for which the R configuration script checks 
presence or absence. Could ATLAS be one of them? Isn't this an issue 
in the Linuxs also?

I think it's reasonable to expect R users who wish to build from 
sources to have DevTools and fink installed.

I agree. Readily available, perhaps, but at a prohibitive financial 
price, I think. In OS X, the tools are available, but the cost is 
more in the users' time than his/her money.

Again, I think it's reasonable to expect R users who wish to build 
from sources to also install fink to get these. One just needs to 
know which other libraries are required.

And how many of these binaries required modifications either to 
source code (C or fortran?) or to a makefile, that were specific to 
OS X/Darwin.

For example, if I develop a package that includes fortran or C code, 
I can only test it on platforms available to me. How, in general, do 
package developers ensure that their packages work on all of the 
platforms that R works on? Is OS X so different that whatever has 
been working for various other unixes doesn't work for OS X?

I've had pretty good success with install.packages() in Darwin R, 
though that may be because I've only tried some of the simpler 
packages. And not very many either.

I'm a little concerned at this prospect, because you and Stefano and 
others currently involved who have the expertise will someday wish to 
stop--who will take your place? The higher the level of expertise and 
resources required, the fewer potential candidates, I would think.

I greatly appreciate the effort and generosity involved in providing 
binaries--especially in OS 9 and the early days of OS X. Even so I 
would feel more comfortable knowing that I could build from sources 
if necessary. So I hope this vision comes to pass.

I could probably increase the usage of R around here if there were a 
GUI, but it strikes me as an extremely challenging task. Unless 
someone wrote a generic gui-generator function that would create on 
the fly a gui interface to any other function.

Just for all Mac users/developers information: we switched to MPW 
instead of using CodeWarrior as MPW is completely free from Apple site.
Starting from version 1.3.x, R can be entirely built with no cost 
products (MPW, MacPerl, f2c)
src/macintosh/INSTALL provide a step by step procedure to have a setup 
for build Carbon R. But, I understand, is not that easy as on other 
platforms.

you should test your package with "R CMD check" and similar, then you 
are not granted that is surely works on other platforms but you can ask 
to the maintainers of the major platforms to test it.

I can only insist with you and other possible Mac R 
developers/maintainers to try to build Carbon R or the Darwin R.

As I said, for Carbon R just try to follow the step by step instructions 
in src/macintosh/INSTALL. This could be a good test to verify if the 
instructions work well for you and other possible users.

For the Darwin R, my suggestion is that you should download the latest 
official sources (not the devel version), then use

./configure CPPFLAGS="-I/sw/include" LDFLAGS="-L/sw/lib/"
make

You have to use fink to install some of the required libraries first.
If you encounter problems, please write in this list and we will try to 
help you. Thus, at the end we will have another step by step list of 
thing to do to build Darwin R.

Thanks to Martin Theus (who provided it) I have changed the icon of the 
R binary (Carbon R). It is a bit smaller than needed but we are working 
on it.

Btw, OSX user using magnifying dock should enjoy it.

The file

has now grown to 60 MB. It consists of a meta-package and its packages 
and
it will allow you to install binaries for R-1.5.1 and about 300 
packages, just by
clicking the R-1.5.1.mpkg file. It also install quite a few dylibs in 
/sw, but not
the ones for X11R6 and gnome yet.
