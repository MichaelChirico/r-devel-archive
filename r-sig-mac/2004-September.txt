Are there any attempts to include an editor with syntax highlighting 
etc.?
I really like the look of the new R cocoa GUI (!), but as long as 
XEmacs/ESS has so many advantages, I won't abandon this editor.

1) 1.9.1
2) Use only X11 Tcl/Tk.  (tkrplot doesn't work in Aqua.)
3) (a) Use the version of the tcltk R package which is
       distributed with R 1.9.1.
   (b) Use Tcl/Tk 8.4.x.

My Mac I.T. administrator is working on an R + Tcl/Tk
installation package for Mac OS X, but I can't do it myself
because I don't have installation privileges on a Mac.

You should install R 1.9.1 from CRAN (http://cran.r-project.org
or your local mirror).  This should include the
tcltk R package, but not Tcl/Tk itself.  If you have the
developer tools (C compilers etc.), you can install Tcl/Tk as
described in the R for Mac OS X FAQ:
http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/RMacOSX-FAQ.html

in the section:
the TclTk 8.4 headers and libraries (optional)

which should install both Tcl and Tk in /usr/local/
This requires the X11 SDK (Software Development Kit), i.e.
header files etc. which should be on the Panther Developer CD.

If you don't have the developer tools, you can try the X11
Tcl/Tk installer at http://www.economia.unimi.it/R/

As far as I know, it shouldn't matter which order you install
things in: X11 Tcl/Tk then R or vice versa.  Once you have
these two things installed, you should be able to type
library(tcltk) from R, and it should find Tcl/Tk in /usr/local/

Then you can type tclvalue("auto_path") to see your Tcl search
path, and you can try loading the Tcl/Tk extensions required by
limmaGUI with tclRequire("Tktable") and tclRequire("BWidget")

They should be installed in
/usr/local/lib/Tktable2.8/ (or whatever version you use)
and
/usr/local/lib/BWidget-1.7.0/ (or whatever version you use)

Let us know if you have any specific errors to report after
installing X11 Tcl/Tk and R and then loading the tcltk R
package, and tclRequire()-ing the Tcl/Tk extensions.

Good luck!
James

Christof,
It may not be what you're asking for, but I enjoy using SubEthaEdit for 
creating R code.  It is a nice text processor and there is user 
contributed plugin which enables R syntax highlighting.  It does mean 
that you have to cut and paste your code into the R-GUI or Source your 
text files.  The program can be downloaded at the CodingMonkeys 
website:
http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/

To add R syntax highlighting follow the developers link and download 
the "R/S-Plus" mode.  This should be placed within the application's 
Mode folder (Control+Click > Show Package Contents > 
Contents/Resources/Modes)

A new binary snapshot of the brand new Cocoa GUI embedding R is 
available at

http://www.economia.unimi.it/R

this corresponds to R-devel 2004-09-10 (i.e. R-2.0.0-alpha 2004-09-1?)

This time I released binaries in the hope to receive some feedback on 
this R GUI before release (there is still time to implement new stuff 
and fix bugs)

Or you can use AppleScript to link function keys to 'source selection 
to R' or
'source file to R' from within SubEthaEdit. With iKey that works really 
well.

I've just updated the new version and tested it on a couple of systems.
You MUST  reinstall both R and R.framework.tgz

The framework assumes you have installed somewhere on the system these 
dlls

        /usr/local/lib/libg2c.0.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, 
current version 1.0.0)
         /usr/local/lib/libgcc_s.1.0.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, 
current version 1.0.0)
         /usr/local/lib/libreadline.4.3.dylib (compatibility version 
4.0.0, current version 4.3.0)


which you should have if you ever tried to build R.
Remind this is a developer version, so I packaged it a bit lazily.

Not really. The default versions of gcc and corresponding version of 
g77 use static libraries thus the above are not present (and not 
necessary once R is compiled). Only readline is needed (and btw: 
there's a 5.0 version out now).

Furthermore I suspect that the errors encountered by Rob won't be fixed 
by the files above, because your personal ZeroLink development 
environment is hard-coded in those files - you'll need to re-compile it 
with "Deployment" target, otherwise you're the only one who can run it 
;).

Cheers,
Simon

my previous answer was criptic. The original error comes from the 
ZeroLink, which I've now changed. The above dlls are linked by the 
R.framework as I built it. Of course, this will be changed for the 
release, but if you want to run this version now you need these. I 
don't have time for refinement at them moment.

Thanks a lot Stefano & Simon. This gets me a lot further!

Once package.install works (see below), I can replace the 1.9 packages.

I noticed that without changing anything, source file using AppleScript 
worked
(except of course I need to upgrade to 2.0 packages), source selection 
does not,
but I'll investigate that further:

 > v1 = c(49, 58, 75, 110, 112, 132, 151, 276, 281, 362)

Error: syntax error
 > v1 = c(49, 58, 75)
 > v1
[1] 49 58 75

Top line (sourced in from selection in editor) seems to add weird 
characters that
causes the syntax error. "v1" is not defined after that. By hand it 
works fine (of course!).

Below my output to try and use binary and source package  install.

This is great progress, thanks both of you for all the work,
Rob

this is a problem due to NA subsettings, no more allowed in 2.0.0
I've committed a fix so it would be fine for the release version of R.

Hi Matthew,

I am still using a PowerBook G3 Series from 1998 and will not be able 
to upgrade for a while yet. Hence I am stuck at 10.2.8 and SubEthaEdit 
requires 10.3.

I use TextWrangler which has syntax settings for many languages, but 
not R. Do you or anybody else know of an add-on or plug-in to add R 
syntax checking/coloring to TextWrangler?

thanks in advance,

Hi,

I notice that there is currently no MacOS X binary for tkrplot
on CRAN.  Does anyone have a working binary I can try?  I've
tried building it from source, but got various warnings
(below), and library(tkrplot) failed with:
malformed library: /Users/guest/Rlibs/tkrplot/libs/tkrplot.so
(not a Mach-O library file, bad filetype value)

This is for a microarray workshop in a few days.  I only just
discovered that tkrplot installation has failed.  So depending
on how difficult it is to get tkrplot working on Mac, it may be
easier (in the short time left) to rewrite my R-Tcl/Tk package
to use the regular R graphics device for all plots rather than
tkrplot (although then I can't use customised Tk menus on
plot windows).

Thanks in advance for any suggestions.
James

removed the final warning, but library(tkrplot) still failed.

Actually there is an older version for 10.2.8 (SubEthaEdit 1.1.5) which I use as a fast altenative to Alpha.
http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/old.html
 It does not cooperate with the new 10.3 version (for joint editing) but  it does so with others of the same sort (including - as I understand but have not tried - with 1.1.5 on Panther. Probably you can run both versions on Panther for use with different partners). In any case it has R/S formating (downloadable from the same page).
The version is poorer in features but this does not affect the R/S coloring.

(actually while it ran up to now without problems, just today it 'quits unexpetedly, the system has not been affected', I will have to reimplement it if it does not work after a restart).

Yes.  That was a big mistake, not noticing that
R CMD build --binary was using Aqua Tcl/Tk instead of X11
Tcl/Tk - oops!  Although I thought that machine had X11 Tcl/Tk
in /usr/local/ so I still don't completely understand why it
chose Aqua Tcl/Tk.

Thanks for that.  Luke Tierney has also explained this to me.

OK, that's good to know.  Thanks.

BTW, I have found it to be quite easy to modify my R-Tcl/Tk
package to allow using the regular R graphics device as
an alternative to tkrplot, so whatever happens with tkrplot
installation, we'll be OK for our microarray workshop on
Thursdsay.  Whilst I do have a few Tcl/Tk-specific interactive
plot features and menus, the main reason for using tkrplot was
for Windows users running R in MDI (Multiple Document Interface)
mode, who like to minimise the MDI frame so it doesn't steal the
focus from Tcl/Tk windows, but then the plots are lost in the
minimised MDI frame.

Anyway, thanks very much to Jan and Luke for some great tips!

Best regards,
James

Do you have the Jaguar version of g77 ? Your problem may be
that you are trying to run the Panther version on Jaguar.

Hello,

I have the following error message when launching R from the command-
line (in the Terminal) when i am connected to my Mac from home, or when
i am connected (through ssh) with a username different from the one
who opened the current session.

kCGErrorRangeCheck : Window Server communications from outside of session allowed for root and console user only
INIT_Processeses(), could not establish the default connection to the WindowServer.Abort trap

If i sudo R, then it works.

Is there a way to use R from the command line with a non root user,
or with a user different from the user who opened the current session,
or when no session is opened ?

Thank you,
Jean

Hi Denis,
Sorry it took me a while to get back on this.  I don't know about a 
plugin for TextWrangler which handles R syntax.  However SubEthaEdit 
does come in an earlier version which is compatible with OS X v.10.2.8. 
   It can be downloaded from the developers website:  
http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/old.html

You will also need to download the R syntax definitions which is 
available on the same page.

Message-ID: <A8366482-0C9A-11D9-9CBC-000A95CD7F02@sheffield.ac.uk>

Hi -

R1.9.1; OSX 10.3.5; Dev Tools etc install.

Thought I'd try here first.  I have installed, via darwinports,  
graphviz running in x11 (I also have the standalone aqua app...)
Having done that, I have tried to install RGraphviz from the  
Bioconductor suite via the x11 route to R, as Rgraphviz needs graphviz  
in the x11 environment (I think).

First, I used the Bioconductor script

getBioC("graph")
which installed everthing successfully except RGraphviz and Guuid....

Assuming that the build of RGraphviz would require the library path for  
graphviz installed by darwinports, I tried this to remedy the failed

Yes, this is the famous SetForegroundProcess problem. There
is a way around it that does not involve changing the R sources.

One simple version of this is to download my R from
http://gifi.stat.ucla.edu/pub, although that computer is currently down.
because of our move.

The other is to apply the resourcefork hack.

1. Install Aqua Tcl/Tk and recompile R using this Tcl/Tk, configuring  
with

configure  
--with-tcl-config=/Library/Frameworks/Tcl.framework/tclConfig.sh  
--with-tk-config=/Library/Frameworks/Tk.framework/tkConfig.sh  
--enable-R-shlib --with-aqua --with-blas='-framework vecLib'  
--with-lapack TCLTK_LIBS='-framework Tcl -framework Tk'  
TCLTK_CPPFLAGS='-I/Library/Frameworks/Tcl.Framework/Headers  
-I/Library/Frameworks/Tk.Framework/Headers'

2. Go to

/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/bin/exec and say

sudo /Developer/Tools/Rez -t APPL Carbon.r -o R

same in Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/bin

3. When you start R from terminal or emacs, first load the tcltk  
library.
You can put this in R.profile, so it's done automatically.

This amounts to borrowing the Aqua Tcl/Tk event loop to run R as
a Classic (Tcl/Tk) application.



Now you're set

a) The machine will be up tomorrow

b) Stefano and Simon are working on the Cocoa interface for R (which is  
coming along
very nicely), and the problems of (b1) using Quartz from the command  
line and
(b2) of using Aqua Tcl/Tk from the Cocoa interface are not on the list  
for 2.0.0.

Message-ID: <EEE03005-0DC4-11D9-80B9-000A95A67E82@stat.ucla.edu>

A bunch of files needed to install R-2.0.0 (alpha) on your computer can
be downloaded from http://gifi.stat.ucla.edu/pub

This is not longer an installer package, but for the moment a bunch
of separate tgz and zip files, with instructions on where to unpack
them (you have to have admin privileges).

This comes with separate archives for g77, emacs-carbon, emacs-X11,
readline + Tcl/Tk (X11), GTK+OSX, R.framework and R.app. Here
R.app is a recent Cocoa interface by  Stefano Soatto and Simon
Urbanek.

This is a "batteries included" version of R, because it comes with
binaries for more than 560 packages, all recompiled for R-2.0.0.
Some of these packages are compiled using dynamic libraries that
may not be on your system -- if you run into this problem drop me
a line.

To run R (even from the command line) you need to install readline,
for graphics you need to have X11 installed.
