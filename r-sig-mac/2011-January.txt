Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Poor Performance of R for Mac as distributed on the
	developer's page
Message-ID: <EC719AAD-72AF-490C-8BD4-E07B27D11C1F@me.com>

Dear all,

I have been using the stable branch (i.e. 2.12-branch patched for now) downloaded from http://r.urbanek.info/ for quite a long time.  The binary is compiled on Mac OS X 10.5 as said on the webpage. Just for curiousness I tried to build R on my laptop today and got some surprising result about the performance.

The benchmark is R-benchmark-25.R on http://r.urbanek.info/benchmarks/

For a complete log see the end of this email.

The laptop used for testing is a mid-2010 macbook pro 15", with core i7 2.66GHz, 8GB memory, Mac OS X 10.6
Two versions of R are tested, one is the binary downloaded from http://r.urbanek.info/, R 2.12.1 patched (2011-01-08). 

The other is build from source. The source is checked out from SVN repository, 2.12-branch, revision 53948 (https://svn.r-project.org/R/branches/R-2-12-branch/). The building is almost the same as described on http://r.urbanek.info/building.html, except that gfortran is replaced by intel ifort and only x86_64 version is build rather than a universal binary. Blas and lapack are linked to vecLib (--with-blas='-framework vecLib' --with-lapack). The build passed "make check" successfully.

Comparing the benchmarks result. The binary distributed from http://r.urbanek.info/ is much slower than the one build from source for  cross-product (10 times slower) and linear regression, determinant, Cholesky decomposition, inverse of matrix (roughly 5 times slower). Other things are almost the same or only slightly slower.

I thought all these tasks are performed by blas/lapack and both versions are linked to vecLib. So I cannot understand the difference in performance. I doubt that it has anything to do with the use of ifort. It would be highly appreciated if someone could explain this to me. In addition I think both R are dynamically linked to the veclib as installed on my mac, the fact the the binary distributed on web is build on mac os x 10.5 should have little to do with this. Correct me on this if I am wrong.

Now the complete log of the two benchmarks.

No, they are not. We do provide both options - you can switch it by changing the libRblas.dylib symlink as mentioned in the docs - but the default has been changed to use R's BLAS due to the issues vecLib has on recent Apple hardware (most notably Mac Pros). Since you're using only an i7 and not a Xeon you are not hit by the bug in OS X and thus  for you vecLib will be faster - see the recent discussion here.

I'm doing so herewith ;). But you should really check it for yourself with

ls -l /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/lib/libRblas.dylib

if it points to libRblas.0.dylib then you're using R BLAS, if it points to libRblas.vecLib.dylib you're using vecLib.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] odd problem building gmp from source
Message-ID: <4D2CE284.206@witthoft.com>

Hi,
I chose to make a minor edit to the R-source  matrixz.R in the gmp 
package (not to be confused with the GNU gmp library which it calls).

On my Intel iMac at work, running OSX 10.6.4,  it compiled just fine.

for reference, that Mac has:
%gcc -version
i686-apple-darwin10-gcc-4.2.1: no input files

and I honestly forget which version of gmplib I installed.

So, I took the R-gmp source home, where I have an Intel iMac w/ 10.5.8, 
and I get the following foulup:

TheiMac:~/downloads/gmpmod:cgw-507$ ./configure
creating cache ./config.cache
checking for __gmpz_ui_sub in -lgmp... no
configure: error: GNU MP not found, or not 4.1.4 or up, see 
http://swox.com.gmp

I've tried installing both GNU gmp 4.3.2 and 5.0.1, same problem.  And 
the libraries are in /usr/local/lib, just as they are on my work iMac.

I thought it might be the compiler, so I checked:

TheiMac:~/downloads/gmpmod:cgw-508$ gcc -version
i686-apple-darwin9-gcc-4.2.1: no input files


Any ideas what I've got set up wrong? Let me know what other system or 
app diagnostics I can supply.

thanks
Carl

(I did finagle an ugly workaround, by bringing home a copy of the 
installed R-gmp package.  I had to go to the Library/Frameworks/... 
/libs/i386 directory and swap in the original gmp.so  file (from the 
CRAN package) to get things mostly working))

If you have doubt about your builds of gmp you can always pick the one used on CRAN if you wish at
http://r.research.att.com/libs/

You really meant to use --version I presume:

ginaz:~$ gcc --version
i686-apple-darwin10-gcc-4.2.1 (GCC) 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5664)

but the version usually doesn't matter - especially not on on 10.6 ;)

Well, the only useful diagnostics is the config.log - it will tell you exactly what the error is ...

Simon

Simon,
thanks for the suggestion.  I downloaded gmp-4.3.1-darwin9-bin3.tar.gz 
from research.att.com and installed per their instructions.

R (2.12.1)  successfully built the "gmp" package from my modified code.

Two problems.  First,  every time I execute a function from gmp,  I get 
something like:

apply.bigz(mxg,2,max)
[1] "17" "18" "19" "20"
R(95552,0xa01f9720) malloc: *** error for object 0x1abf5674: Non-aligned 
pointer being freed
*** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug
R(95552,0xa01f9720) malloc: *** error for object 0x1abf5674: Non-aligned 
pointer being freed
*** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug
R(95552,0xa01f9720) malloc: *** error for object 0x1abf5674: Non-aligned 
pointer being freed
*** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug
R(95552,0xa01f9720) malloc: *** error for object 0x1abf5674: Non-aligned 
pointer being freed
*** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug

note that the returned values are correct for the "mxg" bigz matrix in 
question.

The other problem seems to be one of search order, in that, for an 
integer matrix mx,

apply(mx,2,max)   works properly.  But   apply(mxg,2,max) fails to 
"find" the bigz method and returns an error:

Rgames> apply(mxg,2,max)
Error in aperm(X, c(s.call, s.ans)) :
   invalid first argument, must be an array

which is because the character matrix 'mxg' was passed to base::apply.

Any ideas?  and thanks again.

Carl

It occurs to me I should post the mods I made to the source matrixz.R, 
just in case I managed to do something really bad :-(.

Here is my code snippet:
apply <- function(X, MARGIN,FUN,...)
   UseMethod("apply")

apply.default <- function(X, MARGIN,FUN,...)
   base::apply(X, MARGIN,FUN,...)


apply.bigz <- function(X, MARGIN,FUN)

That differs from the original source only in the addition of the '...' 
argument to apply and apply.default.

It has been rather straight-forward for the last several years.  
"Bouncing" is not an adjective that conveys many details or specifics,  
so I'm not sure that any specific recommendations can be offered  
without more ... specifics.

Well, I finally found a version of gnuMP library that plays nicely with 
the R-gmp package and with my OSX 10.5.8 iMac. I loaded the gmp-4.3.1 
tarball from att.com, per Simon's suggestion and all is well.
  I have to admit I'm not sure what exactly solved the problems I'd been 
having, but now my modified gmp library loads and runs just fine.

Thanks again for the help.

Excellent point. Those Tools are needed to succeed with any packages  
that need to be installed from source, although the proportion of such  
packages has really dropped off in the last year. The Mac platform is  
really getting excellent support from Simon, Ripley, and the rest of  
the Core.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Installing Mac packages from a directory of .tgz files
Message-ID: <4D30EC0F.7010608@waikato.ac.nz>

I have limited bandwidth and monthly allowance so I want to install the 
latest R packages from a directory of tgz files that I have brought home 
from work.

The new R (2.12.1) installed nicely on top of my old 2.10.1 and I am 
pleased that the package installer takes care of that OK.

However the installer did not find the new packages ( which are 
currently sitting in Macintosh HD/Applications/tgz12.1 ) and I can't see 
any installer option where I can tell it where they are. ( The place for 
writing a url closes up when you choose one of the local options.)

There was one option where it said the installer would ask the location 
of the binaries and indeed a dialog box was thrown up, but when I 
navigated to the folder the .tgz files were greyed out.

Apologies for taking up this list's time with trivia but I do most of my 
R work on PCs

Cheers,  Murray

I had another try using the package installer, this time using
file:///Applications/tgz12.1/
in the URL slot.

If I use the "Other Repository" option I get:

Error in gzfile(file, "r") : cannot open the connection
In addition: Warning message:
In gzfile(file, "r") :
   cannot open compressed file 
'/Applications/tgz12.1/bin/macosx/leopard/contrib/2.12/PACKAGES', 
probable reason 'No such file or directory'

and if I use the "Other Directory URL" I get

Error in gzfile(file, "r") : cannot open the connection
In addition: Warning message:
In gzfile(file, "r") :
   cannot open compressed file '/Applications/tgz12.1//PACKAGES', 
probable reason 'No such file or directory'


Maybe I should attempt to create a file called PACKAGES?

Well, still no responses, but I'm further along the trail. I decided 
that I must need that 'PACKAGES' file so I went back to CRAN and got it, 
and placed it in my /Applications/tgz12.1/ folder.

This time with 'Other Directory URL' as 'files:///Applications/tgz12.1/' 
I at least got the Package list populated in the 'Repository Version' 
column.

I selected all and clicked 'Install Selected' to no obvious result, 
although maybe I was too impatient. Then I tried again selecting only 
the first package 'abc' but still it seems without response.

Hey-ho

First of all, if you are trying to install from a local repository there are specific and detailed requirements.
See page 21-22 of the R-admin.pdf manual under heading "Setting up a package repository".

Second, there is no need to place the .tgz files in a folder in /Applications.
Also highly undesirable since /Applications is for applications and a system folder.

I have never installed from downloaded files so I may be completely wrong.
I have tested my recipe by downloading foreach_1.3.0.tgz and doing as described below (except that I installed the stuff in my personal R library).

Place the  .tgz files (mac binary package files) in a directory in your user tree.
For example ~/Temp/R

Start R.app and set the above directory as the working directory (menu Misc, Change Working Directory or with setwd("~/Temp/R").

Then for informative purposes do list.files() to check if all went well. You should see a list of the files you placed in that directory.

Now enter .libPaths() to see in which slot the main R library is located 
(Look for "/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/library"; for me it's in slot 2).

Assume you want to install package foreach_1.3.0 (file foreach_1.3.0.tgz) then enter the following command in R.app

install.packages(pkgs=c("foreach_1.3.0.tgz"),lib=.libPaths()[2],repos=NULL)

Repeat for other packages ( you can also set pkgs=c("pkg1.tgz", "pkg2.tgz",...) )

good luck

Yes, but you don't actually need to set up a repository locally: 
provided you have a PACKAGES file you can use contriburl= in 
install.packages (and as I read it, as 'Other Directory URL').

You can even re-generated a PACKAGES file by cd-ing to the packages 
directory and using

tools::write_PACKAGES('.', type="mac.binary")

but the advantages of using a PACKAGES file+install.packages 
(installing in the right order, picking up dependencies) are bigger 
for source packages and a complete local repository.

No c() is required for a single character string.  And you normally 
want to install into the first library tree, not into R's own tree, 
but if you do want the latter it is simply lib=.Library.

> Repeat for other packages ( you can also set pkgs=c("pkg1.tgz", "pkg2.tgz",...) )

Or simply (untested)

install.packages(dir('.', pattern="tgz$"), repos=NULL)

OK, thanks Berend! - I think that worked for the first package. Now I 
need to form a pkgs character vector with the names of the other 2646 
packages. One way I thought of was to open a terminal window in the 
package folder, do an ls, then edit in all the commas and quotes. 
Perhaps you know an easier way?

Thanks, Brian.
I followed your modification of Berend's suggestion and everything 
worked nicely! Now I have a seriously non-toy version of R on my Mac as 
well as my PC.

The command line solution is perfect, but it occurs to me to ask if I 
could have done this via the Packages & Data Gui if only I had been able 
to understand it?

Hi Tena,

Similar things happen in my environment. The xlab and the numbers
under tics are not shown on quartz, although the ylab and the numbers
have no problem.

When I resize the quartz window with mouse, the hidden xlab and numbers
appear. Once I resize the window, further plotting has no problem.

So, the fact is that the xlab and the numbers are given but hidden.

Hi Susumu,

I am afraid the trick you mentioned doesn't work for me.
Interestingly, the sessionInfo() returns the identical

Tena,

I had the same problem myself a few months ago, when I upgraded to OS X 10.6.5 (from OS X 10.4) I don't know why this happened, but by trial and error I found that putting family = "sans" into the plot command brought back the labels.

Bizarrely though things recently started working normally again, with no updates/upgrades on my part. Strange, eh?

Anyway, try the family = "sans" thing, it might help.

Best wishes,

Phil

Greetings,

I have noticed a bit odd behavior of plot() on OS X 10.6.5.
The R I downloaded from cran is R-2.12.1.pkg.  Below is
what I did:

        R version 2.12.1 (2010-12-16)
               .
               .
        [R.app GUI 1.35 (5665) x86_64-apple-darwin9.8.0]

        > foo <- c( 4, 6, 9 ,12 )
        > moo <- c( 34, 37, 41, 49 )
        > plot( foo ~ moo )

This gives me a plot with no labels.  No "moo", "foo", or numbers under
tics.  But,

        > X11()
        > plot( foo ~ moo )

This gives me xlabel ("moo"), ylabel ("foo"), and numbers under tics.
In the first case, by default, I am using quartz, while the second,
obviously, I am using X11.

Does anybody know why this happens under quartz and not under X11?

Thank you.

Missing labels has been reported several times, and AFAIK has always 
indicated a corrupt font cache (or other problems in the font book). 
There are various ways to repair that, so I'll leave you to Google for 
one.

This _may_ be unrelated to a corrupt font cache.  Note that the OP
says the issue is fixed by resizing the quartz screen.

To see this in action (explanation below) I have posted
  http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~khansen/screen1.png
(the initial look of the quartz window)
  http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~khansen/screen2.png
(after resize)

I have always had a (somewhat) similar experience: the first quartz
window does not show the entire plotting area.  If one looks closely
(in my case) you can see the top of the xlab in the plotting window,
but there are no scroll bars indicating that the plot is bigger than
the screen estate, despite the fact that the little icon in the lower
left corner indicates that this is really the lower left corner (I am
referring to the "resize triangle" - no idea what the technical term
is).

When I click the green button (maximize) twice I now get a window
where I can see everything (screen2).

I have also assumed that this is because the default size of the
quartz device was bigger my laptop's screen (physical size, I am on a
Macbook right now).  This is not an issue on an external monitor.
Specifically I have assumed that the window manager has problems
initializing a window that is physically bigger than the  screen (note
that I say initializing - of course the window can be bigger than the
physical screen if I resize it to be so...).  This is pure
speculation, I have no basis for these claims.  I have always assumed
that this was a problem with Apple's SDK and not R.  And while I have
the issue I have always felt it was not worth spending time fixing (if
it is even fixable by someone else than Apple).

Now, the OP can see even less than I can.  Perhaps she is using a new
Macbook Air with even less vertical physical size?  Please respond to
this Tena.

Finally, this was using R-2.12.1, compiled by myself, running from the
terminal but using the quartz device.

But the OP said (s)he had 'no numbers under the tics', whereas what 
you show is explicable as the effect of clipping and the axis 
annotation is there.  I don't think it is the same issue, and I see no 
reference to resizing in the original post (the solution was to use 
X11()).

I re-read the OP, and Ripley is right (as usual) (damnit :)  What
seals the deal for me is that both x- and y-labels are missing.

Hi,

I googled "os x corrupt font cache" and came up with a few hits.
The top hit was:
   http://www.macworld.com/article/139383/2009/03/fontcacheclear.html
and it suggested issuing three lines below from unix prompt:
   atsutil databases -removeUser
   atsutil server -shutdown
   atsutil server -ping
Unfortunately, it didn't cure the problem.  The above link states:
"Prior to OS X 10.5, all font caches ..."  The date of article is
Mar 13, 2009.  As I stated before, mine is 10.6.6.

Another hit was:
   http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20071026081555971
it specifically says, "10.5 Only."  It is different from
the previous one, but slightly messy:
   sudo rm -rf `lsof | grep com.apple.ATS/annex.aux \
     | grep Finder | cut -c 66-139`

I didn't try this one because with different rev constants like
66-139 scare me.  Plus I am happy with X11() and/or adding
Family="sans" in the plot(foo ~ moo). Either is good enough
fix/work-around for me.

Thank you for your help.

Regards,

Tena Sakai

Tena,

If it is corrupted font cache, it will probably also bug you elsewhere
than in R graphics. I have once solved this problem in my wife's iMac
when she was unable to print Word documents from her job. After googling
around, I finally used FontBook.app  which is a standard graphical MacOS
application installed with your OS in the Applications folder. It was
able to find and remove duplicated fonts and check the integrity of the
font files. Took some time, but worked. 

Cheers, Jari Oksanen

I recommend you take a look at Deducer (Full disclosure: My project) or R commander. Here are some links:

http://www.deducer.org/manual.html
http://socserv.mcmaster.ca/jfox/Misc/Rcmdr/

Note that on the mac Deducer must be used with the JGR console, and R commander needs the tcl/tk for X Windows ( http://socserv.mcmaster.ca/jfox/Misc/Rcmdr/installation-notes.html).

Hi Jari,

Yes, an excellent point.  I might as well fix it for good.
I gave a quick look at FontBook.app, but I didn't get intuitive
feel as to how to fix my problem.  I will spend more time on
FontBook.app in a day or two.

Thank you.

Hi,

Oddly when I had this issue I couldn't see any obvious problems on FontBook.app - I only had one Arial, and nothing seemed to be amiss. As I said in a previous message, the problem cleared up on its own, without me knowingly doing anything (i.e. I don't need to use the family = sans trick any more).

Cheers

Phil

None of those.  The bug is in R.app, a separate project (with a 
separate group of maintainers).  'htmlhelp' was deprecated in 2.10.0, 
so it seems no one reported this for well over a year.

In R.app, look at the data.manager() function, and fix() it to use 
help_type="HTML".

Hopefully the R.app maintainers will fix the sources ....

If you have more specific questions, I'd be happy to answer.

Yes, you'll download a *.pkg file which you can open by double
clicking. I believe this will kick off the installer (or a new window
with the installer in it).

	You mean ***envious***! :-)

	cheers,

P. S.  My wife once asked me to explain to her the difference between
``jealous'' and ``envious''.  I said:

	Suppose that you and [for present purposes] Steve were walking
	down the street one day, engaged in conversation, and you happened
	to look up and see, on the corner, myself and (let us say) Angelina
	Jolie engaged in a hot, passionate embrace.  You, my love, would be
	jealous.  Steve would be envious.

The Pogue Missing Manual is good. As are the O'Reilly books. Some of them are more about the Unix under the hood; those are good if you don't have Unix experience, and others are more about the vagaries of Mac-dom. You sort of have to watch it, though--some are dated...

But it is not all you need on a Mac.  You most likely will need (given 
you have been compiling packages and indeed R itself on other 
platforms)

- the matching Tcl/Tk from
http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools/
- the compilers by installing 'Xcode' (which comes on the system DVDs 
but is not installed, and can also be downloaded).
- gfortran from http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools/

Some of these are .dmg rather than .pkg files, but install (in these 
examples) in a similar way.

I use a MacBook Air (late 2008, with SSD) as my laptop and have been 
very happy with it.  If you don't have the matching 'SuperDrive', you 
will find installing software frustrating (but it is possible to mount 
a DVD drive from a Windows box across a local network, modulo security 
issues, and it is also often possible to copy installation DVDs to a 
USB memory stick).

I use vim-r-plugin to interact with r.app,

Emacs lovers will recommend ess I think.

Hi Kristina,

The standard R.app is really everything you need. Build in syntax highlighting, command forwarding, function preview, package installation, managing, and loading etc. makes working with it really easy. However, if you still insist on an "external" editor try JGR (read JaguaR).

All the best
Gerald

As the last line shows, there shouldn't be a permissions problem.  One suspicious thing is that there are exactly 512 lines in the file ? but in the R.app preference pane I have the max number of history items set to 1000, so perhaps that's a red herring.

Any thoughts?

The mac installation of R comes with a brilliant script editor built right in.

Just start R, choose file->new to open a script and you are away. 

There is line numbering, coloured context for functions etc, smart brackets and quotes and keystrokes to send the code you select to the console:

cmd+return to send selected text or the line you are on.

You've got all you need to get started quickly (and perhaps all you need), courtesy of the excellent development team for the mac.

Good luck.

I agree the built-in editor works well.

I?ll add that I work entirely in Textmate.

In addition to the built-in editor?s features such as command execution, it offers

Flexible execution (run in R.app; run in a daemon, return to clipboard, return to this document, return as tool-tip etc
Snippets (your own tab-completable smart-typing function insertion)
Commands: convert a list of numbers to an Rvector  or matrix; drop-down menu for par() parameters (cmd-;)? the list is endless and incredibly helpful
Code-folding (so you can collapse long function etc.
Wide choice of syntax highlighting schemes

One can also use aquamacs with ESS: http://aquamacs.org/features.shtml, but I find it quite slow compared to the built-in editor.

I suggest just use one's favorite text editor and execute the code in R.app or terminal (some integration between them will be nice). Sometime things can go wrong, for example a segment of code takes unusual long time or large memory, and then R got frozen. In this case I can usually force R to quite if it does not response. But if I run the code within some editor, then I had to force quite the editor and probably lose all the code I just wrote.

Maybe just I have such  problems from time to time...

I agree, I (generally) adore using the R.app.
(I also use Keyboard Maestro to add a couple of extra conveniences,
like mimicking the behavior of control-R from windows (submitting, then advancing
to the next line), or indenting/de-indenting a block.)

I do have problems with occasional crashes or freezes, 
or editing windows that no longer respond,
apparently when the R.app editor gets
confused in its attempt to do the nice formatting respecting quotes.
Sometimes I can unfreeze a frozen R session by sending a signal from the unix terminal:

kill -4 PID
where PID is the process id obtained from the unix command ps -ax | egrep 'R.app|R64.app'  | awk '{print $1}'
(Safe, I think, when you've only got one R running.)

Ken,

History is saved at the end of your session. 

During a session, the new commands should show up at the bottom of the history pane.

Regards,
Rob

Hi Rob,

I do see commands appended to the bottom of the history pane during my
session, but when I quit & re-launch they're gone again.

Perhaps they're being saved to a different location than they're being
read from?

Ken,

That is clearly not right.

Can you try saving the the history file from the history pane button and check what is written to the file?

Can you rename the history file and start over to see if that helps? If yes, would you mind sending me the renamed file?

Would you mind sending me your preference settings file? In: ~/Library/Preferences/org.R-project.R.plist .

Regards,
Rob

Yes, you have the wrong Fortran compiler it appears. But then CRAN R doesn't even use g77 so there is a lot you didn't tell us...

R's built-in editor is not bad, but it tends to be slow, especially 
with large script files (and usually on older Macs).

Some times ago, I have written instructions for my students how to 
set up a connection of external editors like TextWrangler or 
SubEthaEdit to R. See 
http://www.formatio-reticularis.de/r-mac-editor.html for details.

Dear All,

Although this question was asked and answered many times, one editor was 
never mentioned:

As a long-time Mac user I prefer "nedit" for the following reasons:

- it was developed by people who wanted to have a Mac-like editor on Linux

- it is almost as powerful as emacs but much easier to use and much faster

- it has built-in syntax highlighting for many languages

- it has also syntax highlighting for R, simply install "R-5.3.pats" 
(which I attach)

- it is incredible fast, e.g.:

   -- it can open text files of sizes larger than 500 MB in few seconds
      (e.g. the Affymetrix annotation file 
HuEx-1_0-st-v2.na31.hg19.probeset.csv)

   -- searching such large files is also incredible fast

   -- it opens a C++ source code with 10,000 lines immediately (in 
contrast to emacs)

For these reasons I use nedit daily since more than 10 years on both 
Linux and Mac.

Best regards
Christian

Holding the option key while selecting text, you can select the columns. This is built into the Mac OS X and available in many Mac "native" text editor like textmate, textwrangler, bbedit, etc, even the system's TextEdit can do that.

Meanwhile Vim can do column selection with the blockwise-visual (CTRL-V is the default shortcuts). I don't use Emacs but heard it can do it, too. So select, copy paste and replace columns is nothing special at all.

You could check whether the appropriate modification to the  
AppleScripts presented at Dietrich's webpage  for TextWrangler and  
SubEthaEdit would do the trick:

Luca,

There are essentially two methods:

1. RMySQL

2. RODBC (also on CRAN), which would allow you to connect to MySQL via an ODBC driver, which is available from:

  http://www.mysql.com/downloads/connector/odbc/

Be aware that for the second option, you will need to obtain the correct 32 or 64 bit version of the ODBC driver, depending upon which version of R you are running on your Mac when you want to connect to the server.

If you elect to use RODBC, Prof. Ripley has created a very helpful vignette, which can be read after installation by using:

  vignette("RODBC")

Lastly, for detailed assistance on R and databases, there is the r-sig-db list. More info here:

  https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-sig-db

HTH,

Marc Schwartz

And, I should add, you need a matching 32- or 64-bit libmysqlclient
library for your version of R, which means you will need to install 
MySQL locally even to use a remote server.

(same as RMySQL ....  There is also an Actual Technologies driver.)

Good points, which I was unaware of, as I don't use R with MySQL, although I do have it installed locally on my MacBook Pro for use with WordPress via phpMyAdmin.

Right. I was going to point out the AT driver (http://www.actualtech.com/product_opensourcedatabases.php), but unless there are advantages to the AT driver @ $34.95 U.S., the MySQL driver is free.

I did not have the free option with Oracle unfortunately...

Since OS X already has the matching Java all you need is the MySQL JDBC driver Connector/J - see ?JDBC for an example.


Nonetheless I was going to interject that all the methods above assume that the database is accessible form the outside, which is usually not the case. So you should check first that the MySQL is actually running on a externally accessible port so you can connect to it remotely. If it doesn't, you can use ssh + port forwarding if you have ssh access to the machine, otherwise you're in trouble.

Cheers,
Simon

Hi Rob,

It appears that the file is being written to .Rhistory in the working
directory, but *I think* it reads from ~/.Rhistory in my home directory.
In my preference pane I've got it set to read from ~/.Rapp.history, so
that's 3 different files.  That last file seems to always be empty.

Here's my plist file (converted to text):  https://gist.github.com/798719

When you suggest renaming the file & starting over, which of those 3 would
you suggest?
