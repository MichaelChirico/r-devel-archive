Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Bug Report
Message-ID: <0F31BBE9-E6A6-4EC0-B26A-A12AC59DB941@mac.com>

Deleted my old copy of R.framework and associated files and installed  
the powerpc/R-2.2.1.dmg version from http://cran.r-project.org/bin/ 
macosx/

Version from in the command line copy: Version 2.2.1  (2005-12-20  
r36812)  System is OS X 10.4.5, 12" PowerBook G4 w/ 640 MBs of RAM.

When I launch R-GUI it consistently crashes on me.  Attempting to  
remove preference files and other created files does not appear to  
affect anything.

Sincerely,
David H. Clements

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Abort installing packages using gui under Panther
Message-ID: <44089B9B.7030907@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

Hello List,

    While trying to install a new package using the gui, I tried ...
(Packages & Data) ->
(Package Installer) ->
(Get List) to a get list of mirrors
(OK) after selecting a mirror

At this point, a dialog pops up asking whether I want to use the
selected mirror as default, ... and then aborts.

My details are ---
platform powerpc-apple-darwin7.9.0
arch     powerpc
os       darwin7.9.0
system   powerpc, darwin7.9.0
status
major    2
minor    2.1
year     2005
month    12
day      20
svn rev  36812
language R


There is nothing of interest in the console log.  I have included the
program dump. Thanks for the help.

-Jim

Hi all,

is anyone willing to provide some good/nice/beautyfull snapshot of  
R.app as of version 2.2.1 ?
The one currently on Apple's and VersionTracker's site is quite an  
old one.

This is not a competition, but if you want to contribute, please send  
your favorite R.app snapshot to me and Simon.

Full size, png preferably.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Does the universal installer build R as a shared lib?
Message-ID: <440C3E14.9060700@eden.rutgers.edu>

Hello there-
I am new to R and used the new universal installer to install it (Mac OS 
X 10.4.5); wonderfully easy. Over the weekend I tried to build Rpy and 
got an error  (below); though I haven't found any information on that 
error, I do see a recurring theme that R must be compiled as a shared 
library for Rpy to work correctly. Does the universal installer build R 
as a shared library?
Thanks,
Rolando.

Kjell-
Beautiful!
Thank you. Just to reiterate (sorry that I did not find this in the 
archives), one needs to edit Rpy's setup.py to remove Rlapack from the 
list of required libraries in Darwin. Worked well! Thanks.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] restricting the number of threads used on a dual-core
	Intel machine
Message-ID: <40e66e0b0603080651j13c4e911p198763d40ad5716f@mail.gmail.com>

A few days ago I wrote to r-devel about a curious timing result where
a dual-core Athlon 64 was much slower than a single core Athlon 64 on
the same task in R.  I noticed that the accelerated BLAS, either
Goto's BLAS or ACML (AMD Core Mathematics Library) were using two
threads on the dual-core machine.  It turns out that multithreading
was the cause of the slow performance of R on this task.  Setting
OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 in the environment slows down a BLAS-bound
calculation but gives much faster performance on the R task.  The use
of this environment variable is mentioned in an appendix of the R
Installation and Administration manual.

So my question is how does one set this environment variable for the R
Console on an Intel Mac or even R running in a terminal on an Intel
Mac?  I tried setting OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 in the environment before
running R in a terminal on a Mac but that did not seem to have an
effect.

To check whether you are using multiple threads you can run

mm <- matrix(rnorm(1e6), ncol = 1000)
for (i in 1:10) print(system.time(crossprod(mm)))

I do the timing multiple times because sometimes it will only use 1
thread for the first few cases then switch to multiple threads.  If
the elapsed time (third element of the timing result) is less than the
user time (first element) you are using multiple threads.  For example

> for (i in 1:30) print(system.time(crossprod(mm)))
[1] 0.65 0.02 0.35 0.00 0.00
[1] 0.65 0.03 0.36 0.00 0.00
[1] 0.65 0.03 0.35 0.00 0.00
[1] 0.65 0.02 0.35 0.00 0.00
[1] 0.65 0.02 0.35 0.00 0.00
[1] 0.66 0.03 0.35 0.00 0.00
[1] 0.65 0.02 0.35 0.00 0.00
[1] 0.65 0.03 0.36 0.00 0.00
[1] 0.65 0.03 0.35 0.00 0.00
[1] 0.66 0.02 0.35 0.00 0.00
[1] 0.65 0.03 0.36 0.00 0.00
[1] 0.65 0.03 0.36 0.00 0.00
[1] 0.66 0.02 0.35 0.00 0.00
[1] 0.66 0.03 0.35 0.00 0.00
[1] 0.65 0.03 0.36 0.00 0.00

To see that this slows down some computations install the Matrix and
mlmRev packages and try

library(Matrix)
data(star, package = 'mlmRev')
system.time(fm1 <-
lmer(math~sx+eth+gr+cltype+(yrs|id)+(1|tch)+(yrs|sch),star,control=list(nit=0,grad=0,msV=1)))

The iterations should converge around

 37      238799.:  3.01178 0.134283  1.48933 0.701769 0.303707 0.134235  1.84660
 38      238799.:  3.01173 0.134308  1.48939 0.701726 0.303810 0.134202  1.84648

and give a timing like

[1] 119.86 165.42 285.71   0.00   0.00

The very large system time is indicative of problems with multiple threads.

I got a similar result on the dual-core Athlon 64.  After setting the
number of threads to 1 the timing is

[1] 34.74  2.48 37.22  0.00  0.00

Thanks for the reference.  I guess I wasn't clear about not knowing
the environment variable to set.  On some other systems that use
pthreads the environment variable name is OMP_NUM_THREADS but setting
that to 1 on the Intel Mac didn't have any effect.  (I tried this in a
terminal window using the bash shell so I could be sure that it was
being passed to R.)

So my first question is what environment variable should I set and to
what value.  I probably don't want to set if for all applications
because then applications that are built to be multithreaded with
actually run slower.  I just want to restrict R to using a single
thread.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Quartz copy/paste bug?
Message-ID: <1AB8E147-435B-4543-82AB-BA473612692D@mac.com>

Hello,

I have been encountering an intermittent (!) problem when copying  
from an R quartz window and pasting into another application. Often  
it works without a problem, but sometimes one of two things will happen:

- If the quartz window I am copying is active, the full (rounded)  
text field that displays the current working directory is  
superimposed on the pasted plot. It is in the lower left corner (not  
flush against the corner, but in that quadrant). Also, the text field  
in flipped both vertically and horizontally.

- If the quartz window being copied is not active, another image,  
again flipped as above, is overlaid onto my plot. This time, the  
region of the title bar that contains text is what is there, but not  
necessarily from the window I am copying from. For example, the  
active window in my case now is device 4 (title is "Quartz (4) -  
Inactive") and the text in the object in the pasted image is "Quartz  
(3) - Inactive", although device 3 is actually labelled "Quartz (3) -  
Active".

And actually, as I was creating plots to recreate this behaviour, I  
was able to get both images superimposed onto the same pasted image.  
I am attaching this image since it contains both overlays, but  
usually I get one or the other.

When I have seen this in the past and have needed to "clean up" the  
image, I copy and paste into Illustrator. There, it was a simple  
matter to remove the text fields by selecting the objects and just  
deleting them. This tells me that they are indeed composited onto my  
plot.

Finally, I just closed the original window I created the plot in,  
replotted, and the overlaid images went away. A second copy/paste,  
and it reappeared.

Anyway, has this been seen before? Is it a known bug, or is it just me?

Cheers,

Demitri

Doug,

quick summary: AFAIK you can't w/o re-compiling and even if you do,  
it doesn't help

The CRAN Intel Mac binary of R uses threaded ATLAS. According to the  
documentation ATLAS doesn't allow you to change the number of threads  
it uses - it is wired-in at compile time. Moreover POSIX threads are  
just a specification. OMP_NUM_THREADS only applies to OpenMP (and  
compatible?) as far as I can tell, it doesn't apply to POSIX threads  
in general. OS X uses mach threads, pthread is just a wrapper and I  
didn't find any documentation that would allow you to limit the  
number of threads at that level.

Now, back to your examples. The main reason for using threaded ATLAS  
as opposed to vecLib is that it is more than twice as fast (vecLib  
doesn't use threads). Here are the timings for ATLAS (multi-threaded)  
vs vecLib (single-thread):

1e6 crossprod:
vecLib  0.78 0.02 0.80
ATLAS 0.66 0.03 0.36

As expected, threaded ATLAS is more than twice as fast as vecLib.

vecLib 113.47 163.36 277.23
ATLAS 94.04 141.29 235.80

However, ATLAS used only 34 iterations instead of 37, but you can  
still say that they are not far apart. Please note the extremely high  
system time in the lmer example. I ran some profiling and 60% of the  
entire runtime is spent in malloc/free. Also the load is only on one  
CPU, so both are effectively using only one thread here.

I also ran the example on a dual G5 with threaded vecLib and it  
clearly cannot take advantage of multiple CPUs and again, we have an  
extremely high system time:
63.12 120.94 185.96
and again, sure enough, almost all of that system time comes from  
malloc. The heaviest call tree is r_cholmod_super_numeric(Matrix)- 
 >dsyrk_, so that is where all the time is spent.

As a side note - vecLib on both platforms uses ATLAS internally. The  
degree of optimization varies - especially on Intel Macs a tuned  
ATLAS for Code Duo is faster than vecLib which is probably due to  
compiler choice (I was using the more recent gcc 4.0.3), tuning for a  
particular CPU and maybe the fact that vecLib is a shared library.

Cheers,
Simon

Demitri,

I have encountered this bug occasionally, but very rarely. The  
problem is, I didn't figure a way to reproduce it consistently. I was  
fiddling around with Quartz locking etc., but without reproducible  
example, it's almost impossible to fix. If you or anyone else could  
come up with a way to reproduce this behavior consistently, it would  
be great. Please let me know if you have a way for this to appear  
more often - I'd appreciate that.

Thanks,
Simon

Dear all - I too have experienced this.  While I don't know what  
causes it, I do know that using dev.copy2eps() and then opening that  
file in preview (translates eps to pdf) never causes the trouble.

Yep, me too.  I see the problem when I do a print > save as pdf.   
Random bits of GUI elements, especially directory information, appear  
in the pdf images.  Good news is, I have workaround.  Try hiding all  
other windows (R > Hide Others) or closing all other windows.  Seems  
to help me.  Hope the developers sort this out soon.

Unfortunately, I have not been able to reproduce the bug  
consistently. It "just happens". :)

I started to poke through the code, and wanted to get your thoughts  
on this. In the copy: method in RQuartz.m, I replaced the following  
code:

	[deviceView setPDFDrawing:YES];
	[deviceView lockFocus];
	[deviceView writePDFInsideRect:[deviceView bounds] toPasteboard:pb];
	[deviceView unlockFocus];
	[deviceView setPDFDrawing:NO];

with:

	[deviceView setPDFDrawing:YES];
	NSRect r = [deviceView bounds];
	NSData *data = [deviceView dataWithPDFInsideRect:r];
	[pb setData:data forType:NSPDFPboardType];
	[deviceView setPDFDrawing:NO];

A very simple (non-exhaustive!) test showed that this code will copy  
the pdf as expected. Behind the scenes, I don't know if this is any  
different from what you have, but I'll run with this change for a  
while to see if it happens again.

Cheers,

Demitri

Message-ID: <12d13a930603130733p28f62d4ai7296ec4ff1af0e43@mail.gmail.com>

I have R on Mac OS 10.4.5 on a MacBook pro.  When I run R on terminal,
plotting functions don't work.  (basically, I type hist(x) and nothing
happens)  However, when I run it from Xterm or from R.app, the quartz
application is functional and the graphics pop up.  What's going on? 
Anyone encounter something like this?

Thanks,
Dave

R uses X11 for plotting from xterm; this isn't necessarily available from
the terminal (read as is not).  I think you are describing expected
behavior.  Simply run R from an xterm and graphics will work.

You need to start the X server and to set the DISPLAY environment  
variable. You should be familiar with starting the X server given  
that you are already running xterm. The DISPLAY variable may be set  
by creating the file
    ~/.profile
containing
   export  DISPLAY=:0.0
(you can also use .bashrc/.bash_profile but as far as I know Apple  
have simplified to .profile).

When you run R in a terminal the default graphics device is X11 if the 
DISPLAY environment variable is set and postscript() otherwise (or is it 
pdf() now?).

Your graphs are probably in a file called Rplots.ps or Rplots.pdf.

i didn't find any mention of this problem in a google search --
obviously i can work around the following, but i'd appreciate
comments on getting download/install.packages to work in this context.
is this just an indication of a missing repository resource for

I've just installed R-devel   Version 2.3.0 Under development

make install was fine), but now trying to install  a source package I  
get:

isn't there something fishy with the specification of the Makeconf

Hi Vince,

Someone in our lab was seeing a similar segfault here on OS X.  We
didn't get to the bottom of it, but if I recall, it was something with
how the error message is handled inside of download.file.

Can you try getting the gdb backtrace?  Here's how I would try:

    R -d gdb
    # gdb starts up
    gdb> run
    download.file(url="http://www.r-project.org/FOOBAR123",
                  destfile=tempfile())
    # I think you will get the same crash and be back to gdb
    gdb> bt

+ seth

I sent the message below to r-sig-mac yesterday, but having no reply
I decided to explore a bit myself and found that editing:

/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.3/Resources/share/make/ 
shlib.mk

yzzy: diff shlib.mk shlib.mk~
3c3
< include $(R_HOME)/etc/Makeconf
---
 > include $(R_HOME)/etc${R_ARCH}/Makeconf

restored the functionality of R CMD INSTALL.

Is this a known issue?

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] rgraphviz again
Message-ID: <441A7395.5040002@ucdavis.edu>

Hello,

I know that graphviz has been covered a couple of times...I have read those posts and am still having trouble.

1) I note that there is a binary of Rgraphviz now available.  Is that usable?  And if so, where is it expecting graphviz to be installed?  when I try it with graphviz installed in either /usr or /usr/local I get 

>> library(Rgraphviz)
> Loading required package: graph
> Loading required package: cluster
> Loading required package: Ruuid
> Error in dyn.load(x, as.logical(local), as.logical(now)) :

>   Expected in: flat namespace
> Error: .onLoad failed in 'loadNamespace' for 'Rgraphviz'
> Error: package/namespace load failed for 'Rgraphviz'



2) I have also tried installing Rgraphviz from source.  In that case I get 

>> Sys.putenv(LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/lib/graphviz")
> trying URL 'http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/bioc/stable/src/contrib/Rgraphviz_1.8.0.tar.gz'

The above make me wonder if I am not installing graphviz correctly.  I can't find 'dotneato-config' or 'pkg-config' anywhere either.

One of the previous posts makes reference to instructions on Stefano's page or the R Developers page.  Current R Developers links take me to cran and no info on graphviz...does such a page exist somewhere?

Any advice on what to try next or where to look for more info?

Thanks,

Julin

Massimo,

please read the FAQs and if still think your problem is unique, check  
the list archives (and read the posting guide!). Your problem is  
covered by the FAQ and the fix is as simple as running
sudo gcc_select 3.3

Cheers,
Simon

You need to get the exact right version of graphviz before installing  
Rgraphviz. Around December I spent most of a day getting it to work.  
At that time the current stable version was 2.6 and the devel version  
was 2.7. I had to use the devel version, but then it worked "out of  
the box" so to speak.

I think Simon is the one building the Rgraphviz binary so he might be
able to shed some light on where it is expected to work (with which
version of R and whether a graphviz lib is required or not).

If you installed a recent graphviz, then there is no dotneat-config
script.  Instead, for the autoconf tools to work, you need the
pkg-config program installed and PKG_CONFIG_PATH set appropriately
(/blah/lib/pkgconfig).

But it should also work to pass the --with-graphviz configure option.
Something like:

R CMD INSTALL --configure-args='--with-graphviz=/blah/graphviz' \
    Rgraphviz_x.y.z.tar.gz

So I would try this first.  If you still are having troubles, report
back, but please include R version and how you installed, graphviz
version and how/where installed, Rgraphviz version, height, weight...

cheers,

I'll give it a shot.

That's good.  The graphviz headers and libs are most likely somewhere
under /usr/local/.  That is the default "prefix" used for almost all
code when you do "./configure; make; make install".  

Have look under /usr/local/lib or possibly /usr/local/lib/graphviz.
See if you can find a directory called pkgconfig that contains a file
called libgvc.pc.  Now let's assume you found this dir here:
/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig.

I think it will be better to try to use graphviz-2.8 which you
installed from source.  Since you are using fink, you can (and should)
install the pkgconfig package.  This will give you an executable named
pkg-config.

Now you can try the following:

   export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig
   R CMD INSTALL Rgraphviz_1.8.0.tar.gz

The first line sets an environment variable.  You may need to adjust
the value to the actual path where you found the pkgconfig dir
containing libgvc.pc.  If you don't have the Rgraphviz source tarball
handy, you can either download it from the Bioconductor website, or
from the same shell where you just ran the export command to set the
environment variable, do

   R
   > source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
   > biocLite("Rgraphviz")

Let us know how things turn out.

    Quick aside: if you want to install to a specific place, say
    GVIZ-TEST under you home directory, you could do this:

        mkdir ~/GVIZ-TEST
        cd graphviz-2.8
        ./configure --prefix=~/GVIZ-TEST
        make
        make install

Hi Seth (and everybody),

graphviz 2.8 installed by
./configure
make
make install

That installed it in /usr/local (the libs are in /usr/local/lib/graphviz)

Unfortunately, using the '--with-graphviz...' doesn't work... it is still looking for dot-neato

However, I realized that I do have pkg-config installed, so I also tried what Seth suggested to Michael Kubovy.  This gets me closer, but there are some linking problems.

After a little web-research I realized that I needed to "gcc_select" to ensure that the lcc_dynamic file existed.  After gcc_select 3.3, everything works!!

Hi Seth,

I installed graphviz 2.8 downloaded from http://www.graphviz.org/pub/ 
graphviz/ARCHIVE/graphviz-2.8.tar.gz and compiled using the commands
./configure
make
make install

It apparently succeeded.

However:

Moreover in R I have Rgraphviz 1.8.0, but

Could you please unpack the above to an extent appropriate to the  
level of ignorance you see in my description? In other words I don't  
know about autoconf, or pkg-config, nor how to set the  
PKG_CONFIG_PATH  nor how to determine /blah/lib/pkgconfig what the  
appropriate 'blah' is.

And just to make sure that I'm giving you all the information you  
might need to help me: (1) FinkCommander tells me that I have  
graphviz 1.9-11 installed. (2) I have Graphviz Version 1.13 (16) from  
pixelglow. (I've successfully used it to generate graphs. As is  
probably clear, I'm trying to integrate graphviz into my R toolkit,  
which is not urgent, but would be satisfying.)

Thanks,
Michael

Did you type 'sudo make install'? If not, graphviz may not have  
actually installed itself (making sure /usr/local/bin/dot exists is a  
way to check this)

I recently did an Rgraphviz build for myself using graphviz-2.9  
(though 2.8 should also work fine) and Rgraphviz 1.9.6 (the SVN  
version) and pkg-config (which I get from http:// 
pkgconfig.freedesktop.org/releases/).

I should note that I don't use Fink or Darwinports and that Glen Low  
(author of Graphviz.app) seems to have wandered off to other things  
so the GUI version of Graphviz is pretty massively out of date these  
days.

Hi Michael,

Looks like you have two installations of graphviz; the one in sw/ is from fink.  I am not sure why it would interfere, but perhaps you should use fink to remove the one in sw.

I assume you saw my post to the group last night...Seth's recommendation to you worked for me once I used gcc_select 3.3 (the original suggestion to me to either export the LD_PATH or specify the graphviz location directly to R did not work).

that is,

#check to see that usr/local/lib/graphviz and usr/local/lib/pkginfo exist (created from the graphviz installation)

#make sure gcc3.3 is set up correctly:
sudo gcc_select 3.3

#export the location.  Note that the expot command doesn't work in csh or tcsh, so you should use bash
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig

#then compile and install Rgaphviz
R CMD INSTALL Rgraphviz_1.8.0.tar.gz 


hope that helps...

Julin

Thanks to Seth, Byron, and Julin for their help.

Apparently I had graphviz installed twice (once using fink).

Once I got rid of it, everything worked.

I installed graphviz 2.9 downloaded from http://www.graphviz.org/pub/
graphviz/ARCHIVE/graphviz-2.9.tar.gz and compiled using the commands
% ./configure
% make
% sudo make install

Then:
% sudo gcc_select 3.3
% setenv PKG_CONFIG_PATH /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig
% sudo R

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] differences between quartz and pdf
Message-ID: <D4B0F354-A70C-470E-895C-53F6238FF202@globetrotter.net>

Hi,

I have never made anything to change the fonts used in quartz and pdf  
devices, so I assume my settings are like everyone else.

I was trying to position text carefully on a graph within a function.  
However the result was different when I plotted to a quartz device  
than to a pdf device.

My function used par("cxy") to compute where to place text. This is  
indeed part of the problem as calling it when a quartz device is open  
yields (0.1928571, 0.3857143), whereas for a pdf device I get  
(0.387766, 0.6151899).

Is there a way to set R so that when no font size or family is  
specified, the same font/size is used by both the pdf and quartz  
devices?

For now I've written 2 versions of my function depending on which  
device I want to output to, which is not a great solution.

Thanks in advance,

Denis Chabot

Thanks for the reply.

I did type sudo make install.

% which dot
/sw/bin/dot

% ls /usr/local/bin/dot
/usr/local/bin/dot

Both are executable and seem to run:
% dot unix.dot
and
% /usr/local/bin/dot unix.dot
output a file that is different from the input.

So graphviz is installed. My guess is that Rgraphviz doesn't know it.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] problem with R prompt on MAC
Message-ID: <17438.62140.940374.643323@polaris.biostat.wisc.edu>

I have a MAC powerbook on which I have been running R, usually via an
X11-based version of emacs that I compiled myself.  I recently
upgraded my teTeX distribution, after which I began experiencing a
problem with R.  Specifically, the prompt has disappeared.  If I run R
in a shell window, I get no prompt, but if I imagine that one is there
and just type stuff as usual, it seems to function normally.  (Also
options()$prompt returns "> " as expected.)  If I run R via emacs, the
lack of a prompt confuses ESS, so that's a problem.  I'm assuming that
there is some library that I "upgraded" when I installed teTeX which R
is also using which is causing this problem, but I have no idea what
it could be.  Other interactive programs running within the shell
don't seem to have been affected.

I reinstalled the R MAC binaries thinking this might put something
back, but it didn't fix the problem.  Next, I downloaded the latest R
source and recompiled, but this didn't fix it either.  I also thought
it might have something to do with "readline" but running R with or
without "--no-readline" has no effect.

Does anyone have any idea what could be going on?  Is there anything
else I should try?  Is there a standard library that handles this
operation that I should look for? 

Any help would be appreciated.

That is to be expected, because the PDF device uses entirely  
different geometry and path for creating the file (namely the  
PostScript device) than Quartz. If you want to create PDF file that  
is WYSIWYG, then you also have to use Quartz for creating the PDF  
file (Save dialog or quartz.save function).

Yes. They both use the same font (Helvetica) and the same point size  
(12pt). You can, of course, change the default font size using the  
"pointsize" parameter.

Thanks Simon,

But if pdf and quartz use the same font and font size, shouldn't this  
mean that one "character" is the same width and height, on user's  
scale, on both devices, even though they use different geometry and  
path?

By the way, thank you for mentioning the function quartz.save. I did  
not it existed and there is no entry for it in the help system. At  
least none that I can find.

Also, is it normal that in preferences, one cannot set the default  
font and size? The "change" button (my translation from the  
"modifier" in my french setup) is greyed out.

Until recently I had managed to tell R.app (via preferences) that  
news quartz windows should be 5 x 5 instead of 4.5 x 4.5. Today for  
some reason it was back to 4.5 x 4.5. I went to preferences, changed  
both width and height to 5. New quartz windows were 5 in wide but  
only 4.5 in high. I tried repeatedly to force it to be 5 in high but  
that preference would not stick when I closed the preferences window  
and created a new quartz window. In fact, while the preferences  
window was still open I could see the height being automatically  
reset from 5 to 4.5 just by clicking the button for "location" of new  
quartz windows.

Removing the file org.R-project.R.plist and having R.app create a new  
one did not solve this, height was still being reset to 4.5. Finally  
I got the height to stick to 5 by editing the plist file with plist  
editor. I wonder how I has succeeded in the past. I know it was with  
the preference pane, not the plist editor. All this on version 1.14 
(2129) of R.app.

I tried to get today's nightly built but it would not start (quit  
right away, not able to launch it to even see its built number).

Sincerely,

Denis

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Develop a GUI tcltk or Java
Message-ID: <p06230926c048ffd4247a@[192.168.0.110]>

Dear all,

I am running R.2.2.1 on a mac 10.4.5

I have build a very large set of R functions that 
I which to integrate in a GUI.
The trouble here is that I don't know what to use 
and for what I have read Java seems to be 
promising and highly flexible,
whereas Java seems to be more common and simple.
I must say that I have never used either of those 
language and I might be very wrong in these two 
first statements.

Let me first describe what I am planning to do 
before I ask you some more questions.
I want to produce a GUI based on tabulations.  On 
the first tabulations, file preview will be 
shown, plots will be made and many R function 
parameters will be accesible to the user.  Then 
on the later tabs, more plots will be shown, and 
even 3d maps.  I am skipping some details of 
course...

So now, here is my questions

Should I use Tcltk, Java or someother language.
Considering that I wish to have fun while I will 
be doing this what should I use to make my 
journey be more efficient, and pleasant.
Is there any good software that I should use to help me design my GUI...
Finally if your are suggesting me tcltk, which 
one shall I install tcltkaquaBi or x11 tcltk.
Please note that I would like to work on a GUI 
that will not require constant maintaining (due 
to updates), even so it might take a while to 
construct.

Thanks in advance to all.

Nope I had never click on that package to see its

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Develop a GUI tcltk or Java

Hi Dan,

Thanks for the comments and warning,

No I am not experienced with Java, so yes will try the Rcmd package.

Finally, I know this could have been a R-GUI list 
question, but on the other hand
since I have a mac and that the x11- tcltk versus 
tcltkaqua issue is a mac issue
I guess I am not completely out.  So what should I do if I which to install
the Iwidgets for tcltk.   Which version of tcltk should I use...

Cheers

S?bastien

Hi Wiebke,

To figure out what is happening, would you mind sending me:

1)	The exact version of the GUI you are running (the line at the  
bottom of
	'About R' , something like: R Cocoa GUI 1.14 (2283), S.M.Iacus &  
S.Urbanek.
	would be fine),

2)	Your R plist file (in ~/Library/Prefrences/org.R-project.R.plist),  
and

3)	Your .Rhistory file in the working dir *after closing a session of  
R*.

R-Sig-Mac is a better place to ask specific Mac questions.

Regards,
Rob

I downloaded gstat-2.4.5.tar.gz from the site you provided
and experienced no compilation issues. For that matter, the
csf directory was not part of the download, although it is
still listed in the README. Any particular reason why you
cannot use the newer version of the distribution?

$ uname -spr
Darwin 8.5.0 powerpc
$ cd ~/Desktop
$ tar zxvf gstat-2.4.5.tar.gz
$ cd gstat-2.4.5
$ ./configure
$ make

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Ghostscript and R
Message-ID: <f4d38af4ae2.ae2f4d38af4@wright.edu>

I'm a new subscriber, so please forgive me if this has come up before. 
First, here's my technical details:

Mac OS 10.4.5
R: 2.2.1; R Cocoa GUI 1.14 (2129)
X 11 1.1-XFree 86 4.4.0
Ghostscript 8.5.0

I need to create bitmaps of tree distributions to import into Benoit (a
fractal dimensions analysis program).  For this purpose, I've downloaded
Ghostscript 8.5.0 and installed it in the Applications folder on my hard
drive.  However, I cannot get R to recognize that Ghostscript is available.

I've added the following code (found by searching the R-help archives)
to Renviron:

## Ghostscript
R_GSCMD=${RGSCMD='/usr/bin/gs'}

However, all that did was get me the following error message in R:

Error in bitmap("acaldi.bmp", res = 100) : 
	sorry, 'gs' cannot be found
/bin/sh: line 1: gs: command not found

Does anyone have any suggestions on what I've done wrong/modifications I
need to make?

Thanks.

some autocompletion words (function, matrix, crossprod, rowSums, ...).

Also the zip now includes a plist for Rd files, contributed by Dan

$ echo $PATH      # where OS will look for binaries
$ which gs        # look along $PATH for this program

FWIW, my version of 'gs' was found in /usr/local/bin.
Might want to look there.

Adding the command to ~/.Renviron instead might be easier
to maintain (in the face of frequent R updates/patches) if
you're the only user anyway.

I didn't go to this level since I don't use the package
myself, but this configure doesn't seem right..

$ ls /Applications/Grass/grass54.app/Contents/Resources/grass54
$ ls /Applications/grass/grass61cvs.app/Contents/Resources/grass-6.1.cvs

One of these doesn't exist (ENOENT).

PS. Don't specify directories with trailing slashes, EVER.

The line above should have an entry for 'grass', no?
Fixing the configure problem above might help though.

Massimo,

This is my ./configure:

./configure --with-grass6=/Applications/Grass/grass60.app/Contents/ 
Resources/grass-6.0.0 --without-gdal LDFLAGS=-flat_namespace

gstat -v    yields:

Also, even though I am using Tiger (MacOS X 10.4.5), I am -  
apparently - still using Xtools 1.2 and did not install 2.0 with  
Tiger (this surprises me).

Hope this helps.

Regards,
Tom

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] R-gui crash (Debug build 3032)
Message-ID: <442C068E.8000201@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

Hello list,

   Briefly, I've been running R and R-gui for a while and recently
decided to upgrade R-gui ... which crashed immediately upon start-up.
So, I started clean and downloaded and installed R ("panther
R22-patched") from "http://research.att.com/~urbanek/R/" (today) ...
resulting in R working from the command line, but R-gui crashing. Hoping
to be helpful, I installed R-GUI-Debug.dmg and tried again ... and get a
crash. I have included the crash log. Pls let me know if there is
anything else I can do.

Cheers,

-Jim
