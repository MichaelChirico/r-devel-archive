Emiliano,
I think you missed my reply - clipboard is even simpler than using  
external files and I have even provided the AS for this. However, this  
is not what Christian asked for (please read the whole thread before  
replying).
Cheers,
Simon

Simon, I'm following up a post that you responded to online.   
Apologies for the unsolicited email, but I thought you might be able  
to answer a quick question.  I'm running Mac OSX (Leopard) with 4GB  
RAM.  Nevertheless, I was getting the Error: Cannot allocate vector  
of....etc. message running some data and routines on the 32-bit R that  
I installed from CRAN.  I then installed the 64-bit and was able to  
run what I needed without a memory error, BUT, the problem I have now  
is that I can't seem to get a few necessary packages to work in the  
new version.  Specifically, I use routines from the "statnet" and  
"igraph" packages quite a bit.

I see two options.  First, I'd like to have both the 32 and 64 bit  
versions installed on my machine so that I can switch back and forth.   
It seems as soon as I get one installed, the other stops working, and  
vice versa.  The other, better, option is figuring out a way to get  
the packages to work in the 64-bit version.  Is this possible?  I use  
the GUI for both 32 bit and 64 bit (installed the latter per your  
instructions).  Now I seem to be lost completely.

Any help would be much appreciated.

You should be able to install all the packages you need on a 64-but 
machine -- the Linux community has been doing so for years, and 64-bit 
Linux has been part of the testing equally for several years.  (I only 
have 64-bit Linux systems.)

With 'statnet', the chain of dependencies includes 'rgl' where you 
only have access to the X11 version (and will need to modify the 
sources to build it).  I suspect that this is actually a problem with 
the statnet suite - 'shapes' claims to depend on rgl but probably 
should only suggest it.  This is the not the place, but the authors of 
the suite need to be asked to study and follow 'Writing R Extensions'.

We know about the rgl issues, and workarounds are being discussed.

'igraph' compiles from the sources on x86_64 Mac OS -- what problems 
did you encounter when you tried?

Running 32- and 64-bit R on the same machine is very simple (start up 
with R --arch=), but I suspect what you are talking about is running 
R.app (the GUI).  I'll leave Simon to explain that.

I think you're mixing up the terms and confusing yourself. Please read  
R for Mac FAQ  (at least FAQ 12.13). There are two binaries - one is  
the Tiger binary with two architectures (32-bit PowerPC [ppc] and 32- 
bit Intel [i386]), the other is the Leopard binary with four  
architectures (32-bit PowerPC [ppc], 32-bit Intel [i386], 64-bit  
PowerPC [ppc64] and 64-bit Intel [x86_64]). You can never have both  
builds on one machine, because they install in exactly the same place  
-- however having both makes no real sense because the Leopard binary  
is functionally a superset of the Tiger binary.

Whether a given package works in 64-bit is up to the package and  
dependencies in your system. Although we provide package binaries for  
the Leopard build, it is not as complete, because currently we require  
that a package also compiles in 64-bit for it to be included and there  
are occasionally unmet dependencies. As a fallback you can usually use  
a Tiger R package in the Leopard build, but it is not something we  
guarantee and will give you 32-bit only.

One important note: if you have installed one build over the other,  
unexpected things can happen since this is not meant to work. It is  
highly advisable to start from scratch before switching between Tiger  
and Leopard build, e.g.
rm -rf /Library/Frameworks/R.framework

Note that GUIs are specific to both the build and 32/64-bit --- as you  
can see on the nightly page there are three different GUIs: tiger- 
Deployment (32-bit Tiger build), leopard-Leopard (32-bit Leopard  
build) and leopard-Leopard64 (64-bit Leopard build). You have to use  
the GUI(s) that matches your installation. If you installed R from the  
Installer packages (CRAN or R-2.8-branch-leopard.pkg), you will have  
the correct GUIs in Applications.

I hope his helps,
Simon

Thanks for the note, Brian.  This is very helpful.  As it turned out,  
I only needed to compile the packages locally using package source.   
This does not work for "statnet", but I was able to install all of its  
components (statnet is a kind of umbrella package).  So, it seems my  
original question about running both 32 and 64-bit is now irrelevant,  
gladly.  I still don't know why I was getting memory errors on the 32- 
bit architecture, but no need to fuss trying to figure it out now that  
things are running on the 64.  I was also able to get the 64-bit R.app  
GUI up and running...which is nice.

Thanks again for your help!

Ned

In Tcl/Tk documentation 'Macintosh' does not mean Mac OS X: it 
(usually?) means classic Macintosh.

As for 'up to date': I know people still running Mac OS 8.x.

It means that you have upgraded your R instead of a fresh install (see  
the ReadMe that is displayed during the installation). Therefore only  
files that you have added after the installation were kept.

If you want to keep your previous version you have the delete the  
receipt (see the read). Alternatively on Mac OS X 10.5 you can use  
pkgutil --forget with the package identifier (use pkuntils --pkgs |  
grep r-project to see which R packages are installed).

Note than even if you install multiple versions in parallel, you  
should use RSwitch (or do the same manually) to switch between them  
for reliable operation (see FAQ for details).

I'm guessing that it is known, but if not, I can report that it also  
happens on my Mac.

For instance in the 64 bit GUI using the att.research binary R ,  
clicking on the doBy line in the Package Manager window brings up a  
page with a link to "overview". Clicking on that brings up a black  
page in the viewing window.

The other aspect of the Package Manager that does not appear finished  
is the lack of any functionality of the forward and back buttons. When  
using the PM for viewing documentation on packages that are not loaded  
I need to return to the package index page because the fwd and back  
buttons are always greyed out.

I just figured that both these were rather minor difficulties, since  
the overall capacities of R on the Mac are so vast. I would much  
rather that the developers continue as they have been, dealing with  
substantive problems like fixing rggobi/Ggobi.  Thank you to all who  
contributed to that addition. Very kewl. Tried to break it, er, test  
it with a big data set but it held up well.

Can you, please, be more specific - for example why don't you tell us  
which package you're looking at - that would make it much easier to  
reproduce ...

Also vignettes are accessible via Help -> Vignettes which is much  
better than using vignettes() [which is a function in R, not  
Bioconductor AFAICS].

Thanks,
S

The usual shortcuts (Cmd+Left/Cmd+Right) still work. It appears that  
this was in fact broken by Apple in 10.5 not by us. Anyway, this  
should be fixed now.

... um ... I'm losing you here - I don't think that it either  
substantive or a problem at least on my end ...

Hm... I cannot replicate this - in 2.8.1 it shows the paper for me  
without problems.
Zak, Eric, can you, please, send me your sessionInfo() as well as the  
version of the OS X you're running?

Thanks,
Simon

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] plot windows always open over terminal
Message-ID: <4992642E.9070703@gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm trying to figure out what seems like a relatively minor thing: how 
to get R to *not* open new Quartz windows for plots right over the 
terminal window.  I've gone into the Preferences and there are four 
check boxes to select where the user prefers the plot windows to open by 
default; none of them make any difference in my case.  Is this 'normal' 
for R on Mac OS X, or is there something else I should be looking at?

Thanks,

Monte

If you mean the R.app console rather than a terminal (Terminal, xterm 
...) window, yes it seems to have had no effect since the 'new' 
quartz() device.

Ah, sorry, I should not have revealed my spatiotemporal capabilities.  
But let me assure you, 3.8.1 looks great!
Particularly enjoyed the "pay-the-programmer-with-food" package.

OK, it happens for all pdfs in all packages but here is an example  
from  AffyCompatible (mac screen shots)

I have tested the exactly same setup and it works for me without  
problems.

One thought - do you happen to have Adobe Acrobat or some other 3rd  
party viewer installed as browser plugin for PDF?

Cheers,

Removing adobe's pdf plugin does indeed remove the black screen problem, but
also creates a segfault error and attendant forced quits (see attached
screen capture). Occasionally, <Error>: ATSFontFindFromContainer failed:
count = 2. crops up instead.
Turns out I do also have the PDF Browser plugin (for use by Firefox) in my
~/Library/Internet Plugins. Removing that as well seems to fix both black
screen (adobe plugin present) and various memory errors (PDF Browser plugin
present).

The direct Help/Vignettes route seemingly always works fine no matter what
is present.

Yes, I do have the Adobe plugin installed.

So, I deleted the following file:  /library/Internet Plug-Ins/ 
AdobePDFViewer.plugin

and presto! the pdf's are now visible. Thanks!

Again, congratulations on 3.8.1, it's going to be great.

Yes, the R console window.  So I take it I'm not the only one w/ this 
happening... is it listed as a known bug to be fixed?

So, this is using package foreign, not Zelig, to read the file. 
Credit where credit is due ....

Look at the help page for read.spss:

reencode: logical: should character strings be re-encoded to the
           current locale.  The default, 'NA', means to do so in a UTF-8
           locale, only.  Alternatively character, specifying an
           encoding to assume.

So all you need to know is what CP28591 is.  It seems to be "latin1", 
so please try that.  (The next release of 'foreign' will know to try 
that, but we've never seen an actual SPSS file with it in.)

Reading thru the docs on seewave, or maybe sound, (which seewave likes 
to use), I noticed that they hadn't set up a WAV player for OSX.  After 
not having any luck with calls like

 > setWavePlayer(quicktime\ player) , I found a nice little tool, freeware:

http://www.hieper.nl/html/play.html

After installing that,

 >setWavePlayer('/applications/play')

worked perfectly.

Just thought someone might want to know ^_^

Actually R can play (and record) audio on OS X directly without any  
tools - see the audio package ;).

Great timing simon!

A search on <http://www.rseek.org> indicates that package "signals"  
might be very helpful - most audio generated needs to be windowed, and  
signals has that as well as a set of nice filtering tools.

<http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/signal/signal.pdf>

Expected date for R to replace matlab, Mplus, SPSS, SAS, E-prime, and  
LabVIEW = 2015 :-)

Just need to get each of the universities and companies that save  
$5000/seat*300,000 seats to chip that into R development.

Hmmm...  yep, audio (package) looks nice.
This leads to a question of tool name collisions -- there's play() here 
and in seewave.  I'll post my query about that in the r-help list.

Since there was some confusion, that "audio" package supports all  
platforms (Windows, unix, ..), not just OS X. I was just pointing out  
OS X since this is SIG-Mac (and not SIG-Windows ;;).

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Annoying newline character saved in command history
Message-ID: <4A70C6AB-533F-4522-8D5B-D09792C374F5@eawag.ch>

Dear R.app developers

Love your nice application, thank you!

When using R.app, the command history also saves newline characters  
executing commands. That is, every time when repeating commands via  
the arrow-up keystroke, another newline character is added to the  
command.

Example output from an operation:

<pre>
 > x <- seq(1:2); x
[1] 1 2
 > x <- seq(1:2); x
[1] 1 2
 >
 > x <- seq(1:2); x
[1] 1 2
 >
 >
 >
</pre>

This might be a bug since the final newline character marks the  
command execution but not a real new line. This behaviour does not  
occur when executing R via the Terminal.app.

S?ren,

I think you may want to enable "Cleanup history entries" in the R.app  
preferences. In fact that's the default, so I suspect you may have  
disabled it at some point.

Cheers,
Simon

You are tryig to use MASS built for R 2.7.x on 2.8.1.
Looks like /Users/rturner/Rlib needs updating.

Different version of R, or different library paths.  Try .libPaths() 
in each.

Yep.  That was the problem.  Thanks.

Actually I could just *get rid* of MASS (VR bundle generally) in
/Users/rturner/Rlib since this bundle is of course in the main
R library and in this location is of course up-to-date.  Whence
the version of the bundle in /User/rturner/Rlib is redundant and
merely serves as a potential source of problems.

I'm still puzzled as to why there was a problem using the GUI and
not when R was started from the command line.  In both instances
.libPaths() yields

[1] "/Users/rturner/Rlib"
[2] "/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/library"

So I would have thought that R would look (first) for MASS in /Users/ 
rturner/Rlib
--- and find the out-of-date version, and hence fall over --- in either
case.  (And the version of R is the same irrespective of startup  
method.)

Be that as it may, the problem is solved.  Thanks again.

	cheers,

		Rolf

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] update graphics component without redrawing whole plot
Message-ID: <15582-03252@sneakemail.com>

Hi,

I know that interactive graphics aren't R's strongpoint, but I have a question for this list:

Are there any devices/packages available for R on Mac OS that let you move a single element in a plot without redrawing the whole plot? 

I have a complex simulation running in R (with networks and cumulative summary stats), and I want to be able to make small updates to the graphics as the simulation runs. Each tick only a very few of the many graphics elements need to be changed. With standard R plotting this slows the simulation down excessively and 'flickers' the whole graphics window throughout. 

The grid package lets you shift individual elements, but I've tried it in X11(), quartz() and Cairo() devices and in every case it still redraws whole plot. quartz() seems to be the fastest, but also the most flickery.

As a quick example of what I'm talking about, here is some code:

  library(ggplot2)
  qplot(1:5,1:5)
  for(i in 1:30){
    grid.gedit(gPath("geom_point"),x=unit((1:5/5)/i,"npc"))
  }

This should shift the five points in the plot smoothly to the left, but the redrawing of the whole background etc makes it difficult to see what's going on.

Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.

Many thanks,

Peter

I have noticed that OS X sometimes fails to make a case distinction in
the names of files.  E.g. if I have a file ``junk'' and I try to create
a directory using ``mkdir Junk'' it will refuse to do so saying  
``file exists''.

Likewise I have just noticed that in R

	file.exists(".Rdata")

returns TRUE when no file .Rdata exists (but there *is* a file .RData).

This strikes me as an undesirable, uh, feature.  Is there any way that
I can tell OS X to smarten up about this?

Thanks.

Out of the box, OS X filesystems are formatted as HFS+, which is case
insensitive (but case preserving).

There is are variants of HFS+ that are case sensitive; Disk Utility
refers to them variant as "Mac OS Extended (Case Sensitive)" and "Mac
OS Extended (Case Sensitive, journaled)".

If you'd like the file system to be case sensitive, you'll need to
format the drive that way.

It's a (mis)feature of the underlying HFS+ file system that names are 
not case sensitive (but are case preserving).

R is just carrying over this behaviour. OS X 10.6 will have ZFS (by 
default?), it probably won't be an issue with that file system.

Thanks.

Any idea when 10.6 will come out?  And when it does, how enormous a task
will it be to upgrade to 10.6?

It is pretty easy, you just need to reformat your mac (and therefore  
move everything of it, as well as re-installing everything). When you  
reformat you will be asked what file system you want, so it is in  
principle dead easy.

Some mac software needs HFS though, at least as far as I understand.

I think 10.6 will be out towards the end of this year. I've only had a 
Mac since Leopard, I'm not familiar with the pain involved in upgrading 
versions...

Not clear to me what you're saying here.  Are you suggesting that I  
(could) partition my
hard drive into a chunk containing the current file system and a new  
chunk (with
nothing --- yet --- written on it)?  And that I could choose a disk  
format for
the new chunk such that the file system would be case-sensitive there?

But then I'd get case sensitivity only when working with files stored  
in the new
chunk, is it not so?

Sounds dangerous to me, anyhow!

I don't have much of an understanding of file systems and  
partitioning, I'm afraid.

	cheers,

I am wondering if case-insensitive file systems are really such a 
problem.  Because they are the norm on Windows, R is set up to cope 
with them and I chose to have my Macs set up with the stanadard file 
systems so I'm more likely to see problems if they occur.

The only time I have ever seen an issue was the no-segfault.R tests 
creating a file PACKAGES and stopping a directory Packages being 
created.

As I understand it Rolf was unaware that he had a case-insensitive 
file system and so was surprised.  That's very understandable, and 
I've seen it with some new Mac users here -- but they seem to get used 
to it.

The problems I encounter are the other way around: users assuming 
everything is case-insensitive and e.g. documenting 'R CMD install' 
and 'R CMD CHECK' .I had assumed these were Windows users, but I now 
realise that there may be Mac users who habitually ignore case.

	My little contretemps in respect of .RData and .Rdata
	is somewhat related.  And this was caused by my fumble-fingering
	and then, when I discovered my fumble, wondering why an error
	***didn't*** occur.

	Yep.  That is correct.

Yes you could. Whether you want to do so may be the proper question,  
but it should not be for concern about safety.

Those of us with dual boot systems (which are quite common these days)  
have multiple filesystems and the Mac OS handles them smoothly behind  
the scenes. My second drive has a 32 GB FAT32 partition where WinXP  
sits and a much larger partition where my Time Machine backups reside.  
The Mac sees both, but Windows can only access the FAT32 partition  
since it is unable to read the MacOS Extended (Journaled) partition.

Now about something like

 library(ggplot2)
  qplot(1:5,1:5)
  for(i in 1:30){
    grid.gedit(gPath("geom_point"),x=unit((1:5/5)/i,"npc"))

That still redraws, and it flickers visibly on my (latest model with 
nVidia graphics) MacBook Air (on both quartz() and X11()).

R graphics devices use an 'ink and paper' model, so it is impossible 
to remove (or move) elements.  All you can do is repaint background on 
sections of the plot and redraw there.  It can be done much more 
smoothly than that example in base graphics, at least.

We expect to have a double-buffered X11 device soon (it is delayed by 
event-loop issues) and that will probably not flicker so visibly (the 
windows() device is double-buffered and does not).

Dear Rolf,
By default, the file system is not case-sensitive.
So the answer to file.exists(".Rdata") is  correct. And you won't be  
able to write .RData without overwriting .Rdata

You can format a drive with a case-sensitive file system if you wish  
(Spotlight:Disk Utility), but many applications won't be happy to find  
folders containing files with the same (insensitive) name inside.

Yes, last year when R CMD temporarily required case sensitivity for 
INSTALL there were complaints from Mac
users as well as Windows users.  The argument then was that it was 
documented to be a file in RHOME/bin, so file system rules should apply.
If it becomes purely an internal command, it should be case sensitive, 
but if it's a script in the file system, it should respect the host 
filesystem rules.

Message-ID: <15809-74407@sneakemail.com>

Regarding adding Sys.sleep() call: it does make things smoother, but it also defeats the purpose of having live-updating graphics. (Adding a 0.1-second delay to each of the 10^6 simulation timesteps would be counterproductive). I could effectively do something like this by only updating the graphics every few hundred timesteps (I've done this in the past), and that may end up being the best solution.



Prof. Ripley:
That's what I thought. However there are some approaches, eg rgl and rggobi, that don't seem to have the pen-and-paper limitation. I've been playing with rgl, and you can remove individual elements from the shape stack -- you can't edit elements, but you can remove and replace them for somewhat smooth updating.
Ideally there would be something like rggobi that is less special-purpose. With rggobi you can edit the data that generated the plot directly in R and it is immediately and smoothly updated in the window. Unfortunately I've been struggling to use rggobi for R-based network plotting.

Unless I can figure out something cleaner, I'll probaby use the rgl option. It's not ideal (particularly since I don't need 3d), but seems to be the easiest and most flexible way around the "pen and paper" issue. Example code:
  library(rgl)
  points3d(rnorm(10),rnorm(10),size=10)
  xx <- points3d(0,0,size=20)
  for(i in 1:100/10){
    pop3d(id=xx)
    xx <- points3d(i,0,0,size=20)
  }


Thanks very much for all the feedback so far.

You asked about graphics devices, and those do not use R graphics 
devices: maybe you did not mean the technical term?  OpenGL is a much 
richer model, and many modern widget sets are also richer.

Another approach that may not play well on Macs is to use Tk: the 
tkrplot demo shows you can more points around a Tk canvas smoothly.

Yes, I guess I was was using 'device' imprecisely -- I'm not so familiar with the technicalities. Is it correct to say, then, that anything that uses 'grid' is an R device and will necessarily have to redraw to edit existing graphical elements?

I hadn't thought of using Tk. I've tinkered with it a little in the past on Mac OS with decent results. Thanks.

Apple has stopped supporting the R development for Macs some time ago,  
so unfortunately we have no longer access to 10.6 previews and so  
cannot support it. There are some hopes in Apple getting involved  
again, but I wouldn't hold my breath given the experience in the last  
few years.

Simon

Apple's.]

So I'd probably be opening a massive can of worms for myself if I tried
to go the re-formatting route.  I guess I'll just have to live with the
case-insensitivity.  It seems a really dumb design choice on the part
of Apple, but.  They have a perfectly good Unix system underlying their
shaganappi GUI structure, but they let it get mucked up by this case- 
insensitivity
shambles.

As always, it's purely historical reasons. The unix layer is agnostic  
to those issues and HFS+ design couldn't care less about the case (in  
fact it's much more difficult to create a "real" case-insensitive FS  
such as HFS+ nowadays with unicode etc.) - it's just something that  
seemed a good idea long time ago (before OS X). As noted, case- 
sensitive HFS+ (more precisely HFSX with keyCompareType set to  
kHFSBinaryCompare) is around ever since OS X 10.3 for those who think  
they need it. (As an aside - I believe the POSIX certification of OS X  
10.5 is for the case-sensitive version of HFSX).

I wouldn't recommend reformatting. Since not all apps are happy it's  
much easier (and safer) to just add another partition formated case- 
sensitively (HFSX or ZFS I'd say) which you can then use as desired  
for projects that require case-sensitivity. In general due to the fact  
that the vast majority of all users have case-insensitive file systems  
(Windows and default HFS+ on OS X) it's a good idea to test on a case- 
insensitive system to see whether things break. [I like HFS+ for web  
servers because I really hate case-sensitivity of URLs if you have to  
type them...].

An upgrade to 10.6 is not likely to change the case-sensitivity of  
existing partitions, either. The ZFS comment in this thread was IMHO  
entirely irrelevant, because it's not about availability of case- 
sensitivity but the existing defaults and I don't see why (or even  
how) would Apple perform HFS+ to ZFS conversion during an update.

Cheers,
S

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] case sensitivity, my 0.02 worth
Message-ID: <499F4D3D.2040403@witthoft.com>

Here's what I think.

I've had enough trouble trying to convince n00bs that e-mail addresses 
are not case-sensitive, which, at least so far, remains true.

I see absolutely no reason or value to making commands, directory paths, 
file names, etc.  case-sensitive.  It may be "cute" but it invariably 
leads to confusion even within an OS that supports sensitivity. 
Frankly, I'd be happier if R was not case-senstive either.  Maybe it's 
just me, but I don't have the patience to recall whether to type

 >>getNativeSymbolInfo and Extract.data.frame,  or

 >>Getnativesymbolinfo and extract.Data.Frame, or some other combination.

(relax -- I'm just picking a couple example commands w/ capital letters 
in them)

Then again, if it were up to me, I'd ban spaces in file and directory 
names, too.  ~_^

What problem?

Your email has no Re: in the subject and appears in a thread of its 
own on 
https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-mac/2009-February/thread.html .

We don't have a clue what you mean.  Also, much of the time when 
people say they have 'the same exact problem' it is not actually true 
(and how can they know without access to the previous poster's 
computer?  Called the 'Anna Karenina principle' by some).

So please provide for yourself the information requested in the

Yes. Everything works just fine out of the box including the R.app GUI  
and tcltk. This is true both for a native build as well as the CRAN  
binaries.

Did anyone ever solve the unchangeable syntax coloration problem in  
the R-GUI editor?

I searched and I can only find an unanswered post from 2005.

"the unchangeable syntax coloration problem" doesn't show any hits  
either on google or wikipedia - what "well-known" problem are you  
referring to - can you be more specific, please? At the very least  
please provide a link to the post you mean...

I remember this being answered here before - make sure you select some  
other color swatch before closing the dialog and all should be well.  
It has something to do with when the setting is saved in the  
preferences - someone would have to track it down more closely ...

If I go to Syntax in the Preferences attempt to change Numbers to some  
other colour it will revert to blue when the picker is closed. Then  
when I try to change other colours they change to blue, not the  
original colour, upon closing the picker.

Yes, you have to choose some other swatch before closing the window -  
this seems to have something to do with the state of the picker - it  
need to correspond to an unchanged color (any other swatch) in order  
for it to not change color spontaneously when the window is closed ...

I'm currently traveling so I won't be able to track this down and cure  
anytime soon...

I cannot reproduce a crash from within the experimental 64 bit GUI in  
Leapard using any of that input.

I am copying the R-SIG-Mac list which I think is the appropriate venue.

You say you are using OS X 10.5.6 but your R.version info says it is a  
Tiger 10.4.11.1 system. Looking at the CRAN package check page I see  
that the CRAN build is done on an OS X 10.4.10 machine, which is only  
off my one from the 8.11.1 designation, so maybe someone forgot to  
update that entry when they updated that machine.

(Your version is even older than mine, so you might try updating.)

You still sent HTML mail, and we got a nigh-unreadable version with 
lots of blank lines.

Your OS *is* for i386: a properly functioning 64-bit buils on MacIntel 
reports

> sessionInfo()
R version 2.9.0 Under development (unstable) (2009-02-27 r48020)
i386-apple-darwin9.6.0

locale:
C/en_GB.UTF-8/C/C/en_GB.UTF-8/en_GB.UTF-8

attached base packages:
[1] stats     graphics  grDevices utils     datasets  methods   base

(I have LC_COLLATE set to C).  That it is 64-bit is seen from

> .Machine$sizeof.pointer
[1] 8

Like Solaris and some other OSes, Darwin can run 32- and 64-bit code 
on the same basically 32-bit OS.  Some OSes do it the other way 
around, so e.g. Windows and Linux run a 32-bit subsystem with a 64-bit 
kernel.

I suspect you do have s 64-bit build of R running on your 32-bit OS.
