Subject: [R-SIG-Mac]ggobi for OS X on gifi
Message-ID: <35DB638D-6798-11D7-9B4D-000393BB6D36@stat.ucla.edu>

http://gifi.stat.ucla.edu/pub

now has a standalone version of ggobi for OS X. You need the gtk+ and
gdk and libxml2 dylibs from fink. And after installing this, you need
to manually edit the paths in ggobi/bin/ggobi-config to what is
appropriate for you.

I'll post a version with R and Python enabled at some later stage.

For those who do not know about ggobi, see

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac]StatPaper Update
Message-ID: <0A138840-6A16-11D7-B170-000393BDE1EC@hsph.harvard.edu>

So, I'm very close to releasing a "Tech Test 2" for StatPaper (which is 
sticking I guess... Its not used by anyone else according to Google 
:-)). If features inlined graphics and interaction via an OpenMath 
interface. The OpenMath package implements a graphics device and 
primitives for sending/receiving OpenMath primitives. The kernel is 
implemented using the R package in R over UNIX sockets. It could use 
TCP/IP just as easily but that hasn't been tested. Running 
demo(graphics) isn't the speediest thing in the world, but I'm also 
very early in development.

In the meantime, you can feast your eyes on a couple of screenshots 
over at 
http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~bcellis/StatPaper/index.shtml 
showing off the newest functionality.

Comments are, of course, always welcome.

Ok, I went ahead an posted TT2 for StatPaper. I mostly delayed from 
this afternoon to see if I could get plotmath working properly. While 
the metrics are OK, the glyphs are all screwed up (so while it doesn't 
generate an error, it doesn't look right either. On the other hand it 
is MORE successful than pdf() when viewing with Reader under OS X :-)).

NB: If you run demo(graphics) it generally takes about 30-40 seconds on 
my iBook (700MHz, 384MB RAM) so be patient. That said, it SOMETIMES 
crashes the kernel so if it sits for too long you've got problems. Like 
I said in TechTest 1, I'll be more surprised if it works than if it 
doesn't ;-)

You can get it at (as previously mentioned) 
http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~bcellis/StatPaper

If you want to compile the OpenMath package yourself you'll have to get 
and install the OpenMath C library from http://www.openmath.org (the 
INRIA implementation). 'make install' was broken under my copy of bash 
so you may have more luck with tcsh. It also installs in /lib and 
/include (?!) by default so make sure you check it. I built a version 
of the OpenMath package and included it (the OpenMath libraries know 
not this "dynamic linking" technology so you won't need them if you use 
the binary package)

People not using Macs may also be interested in the OpenMath package. 
It occurs to me that I should have posted a source package separately. 
I'll do so in the morning (I need to be up in 4.5 hours to go row so 
I'm going to sleep now)

Good luck and comments are always welcome

Works great (and fast on a DP 1.25). I am not sure which problem
you have with pdf(). Do you set the encoding to MacRoman ?

On my G3 Mac running Mac OS 10.2.5.

I downloaded the sources for R-1.7.0, ran "configure" without problem, 
but then "make" runs into trouble.  I ran "fink update-all" 
successfully, and tried again.  Still no luck (see below).  Any 
suggestions?

The solution: I needed to add

   --with-blas="-framework vecLib" --with-lapack

to the configure command.  Thanks to luke for putting me straight.

Yes. No a solution, but a way around it. Use the configure flags

--with-blas="-framework vecLib --with-lapack"

The problem is that /sw/lib/libg2c.a is not build with -fno-common.

By the way, tonight I'll upload R-1.7.0.pkg to gifi. It is a package  
installer,
i.e. simply double click it, and it will install everything that's  
needed
in /usr/local and in /sw/lib

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac]R-1.7.0 installer package
Message-ID: <6595A9DA-7120-11D7-98A7-000393860F3C@stat.ucla.edu>

http;//gifi.stat.ucla.edu/pub

R-1.7.0.dmg.gz can be unpacked and double clicked anywhere. It is a 
compressed
disk image with an installer package on it.
The installer puts R in /usr/local and puts the parts of fink that are 
needed in /sw/lib (including
gnome, but not including X11 which you can get from Apple).

This version of R comes with more than 290 packages. It uses the vecLib 
framework
provided by Apple for both BLAS and Lapack (which means you need Jaguar 
or higher, but you don't need a G4).

I did not recompile all packages for 1.7.0 (or for 10.2.5 for that 
matter), so some of them will
fail. This is also because some of them use dylibs in /sw/lib or 
/usr/local/lib that are
not included. If anyone has problems because pieces cannot be found, I 
will update
the installer package. Just drop me an e-line.

Seems the installer package contains R-1.6.2 (for mysterious
reasons). I'll try again next week.

http://gifi.stat.ucla.edu/pub

now has a new R-1.7.0.dmg.gz. This is a compressed disk image with
a package installer, a small READ.ME file, and the homals/tkhomals
programs in R (for the gifi techniques homals, princals, morals,  
overals,
canals, and more). These are also available as an R -package
in pub/homals__0.1.0.tar.gz.

The package installer has R-1.7.0 plus about 300 packages. Just
double-click. It also install the relevant parts of fink. You do need
Apple's X11 (XDarwin is probably OK too) and Apple's Developer
Tools (if you want to add and update packages).

Let me know if you have problems with this stuff.

contains additional dylibs, missing from the package installer. They
will be added to the next version. Unpack this in /sw/lib.

It contains the ncurses, tcl, and tk dylibs.

http://gifi.stat.ucla.edu/pub

now has a compressed disk image with a MacPython-2.3 installer. This
gives you R GUI's (more precisely RPy GUI's) based on IDLE (if you
want to use Tcl/Tk), on Pycrust (if you want to use wxWindows), and
on PythonIDE (if you want to use X11). In all three you can use the
quartz device, with the Python GUI's making sure that events are
handled the correct way. Moreover you can mix Python, Rpy,
Tkinter, wxPython code for maximum flexibility. Unfortunately this
implies you cannot use R code, you have to use Rpy code. But
you can make your mixed code files into double clickable applications
by using the BuildApplet tool.

Since I don't want to push 100MB over a phone line, I'll upload
the updated R-1.7.0 installer on Tuesday. This will have the
ncurses and tcl/tk dylibs that were missing from the first effort.
This gives you the terminal and gnome GUI's for R, in which
you cannot use quartz, and in which the tcl/tk is strictly X11 based.

The third disk image will be Carbon emacs with ESS -- yet
another R GUI. The current CVS version does not work  properly,
I am trying to figure that one out.

Message-ID: <DFED40AB-7410-11D7-A4FA-00039394FB00@uwec.edu>


For the first time in a while I tried building R on OS X.

The configure of R-1.7.0 completed, but the build fails with error 
below.  This error was reported in June 2002, but none of the suggested 
fixes resolves the issue for me 
(http://maths.newcastle.edu.au/~rking/R/help/02a/4783.html).

Anyone have any suggestions (other than installing the binaries from 
gifi)?

Thanks, Alex Buerkle

This suggests configure was not able to find your dlcompat library or
that it isn't working for some reason.  Checking config.log may give
more info.

I am not sure about this one, but the differences with my  
build/environment are

I use

configure --with-tcl-config=/sw/lib/tclConfig.sh  
--with-tk-config=/sw/lib/tkConfig.sh --enable-R-shlib --with-gnome  
--with-b
las='-framework vecLib' --with-lapack

there is no need to use the CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS

Also, for what it's worth, I use gcc/g77 version 1175 (which I think  
came with the December Developer Tools).

Make sure you dont have dlcompat from darwinports or opendarwin sitting  
in /usr/local/lib or /opt/lib

One thing you can do is mask /usr/local during config and build (by  
renaming to /usr/local/tmp) and
unmask before the install.

Also make sure you do a clean install (make distclean in any previous  
build).

In-Reply-To: <Pine.LNX.4.44.0304211057380.26029-100000@itasca.stat.uiowa.edu>
Message-ID: <276DA67B-7437-11D7-A4FA-00039394FB00@uwec.edu>

Thanks for the replies.

The problem was that the fink package dlcompat-dev was not installed.  
I think the critical file that it contains is /sw/include/dlfcn.h  
(maybe /sw/lib/libdl.a).

I use fink, so dlcompat-dev is required, in addition to the packages 
dlcompat and dlcompat-shlibs.

Apparently ./configure tests for some aspect of dlcompat that was 
present without dlcompat-dev and proceeds, even though dlfcn.h is not 
present and is necessary for compiling.  Perhaps it is the absence of 
/sw/lib/libdl.a that causes the build to fail.

Anyway, seems like configure should fail in this case and that this is 
a bug in the build process.  Is that correct?

FYI, here are the parts of the different packages:

What is your Java version ? Say "s" in the Java Console under the window
menu in Safari to find out. The searchengine applet loads and  
initializes but then gives
a java.lang.OutOfMemory exception -- there seems to be only 1M  
available,
even after garbage collection. I remember the same problem also occurred
in a much earlier version of R, OS X, and Apple's Java, but then went  
away.
Maybe people who use Java 1.3 do not have this problem.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac]Using tcltk Widgets in Bioconductor
Message-ID: <8421040A-74E7-11D7-AF02-000393639108@comcast.net>

Since you all are seem to be the Mac experts I thought I'd ask here 
first.  I'd like to use the 'tkWidgets' package which is a part of the 
bioconductor project.  Using Jan de Leeuw's R-1.7.0 build from Gifi in 
Apple's X11 xterm window I get the following error:

 > library(tkWidgets)
Loading required package: tcltk
Error in firstlib(which.lib.loc, package) :
         no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable
Error in .Last.lib(libpath) : Tcl is not loaded
Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos) : tcl/tk package `tcltk' not 
available -- forget about `tkWidgets


I guess one wouldn't expect this to work with ith the "R-console" 
interface from Wan and Iacus running R v.1.6.2 -- Not surprisingly, it 
gives the following error:

 > library(tkWidgets)
Loading required package: tcltk
Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos) : tcl/tk package `tcltk' not 
available -- forget about `tkWidgets'!
In addition: Warning message:
There is no package called `tcltk' in: library(package, char = TRUE, 
logical = TRUE, warn.conflicts = warn.conflicts,


Does anyone know if it is possible to use the 'tkWidgets' package under 
Mac OSX?

Well, with an X server running, it works fine for me. But just in
case, do

setenv DISPLAY localhost:0

and try again. This should not be necessary, however, if your X11 is
installed properly.

http://gifi.stat.ucla.edu/pub

has a new R-1.7.0.dmg.gz. It can be unpacked anywhere, and it asks where
you want it to install. Normally, you want it in the root of your 
filesystem, where it
will create sw and usr/local (if they are not there already).

This has ncurses and tcl/tk stuff missing from the previous package. 
The tcltk
and tkrplot packages now work (if your X-server is running).

As always, contact me for problems at deleeuw@stat.ucla.edu

Message-ID: <5B2FAD8C-7A82-11D7-B7D6-000393BDE1EC@hsph.harvard.edu>

First off, I've released a third technology test for StatPaper. A brief 
list of changes:

	* Automatically detect Darwin or Fink installations of R (preference 
in that order)
	* The OpenMath package is part of the application and bootstrapped 
during the local kernel launch process (read: you don't have to do 
anything except launch StatPaper)
	* Backend cleaned up and modified to allow for pagination. There are 
still some gotchas but it does a much better job now. It also has much 
better caret tracking and should always keep the caret in view.
	* The ability to delete blocks (yay!)
	* You can save files as a "package" (similar to Keynote), which 
contains an XML file and the PDF files used for plots.
	* Internally the notion of linking blocks is supported. This will 
become important when drag-n-drop rearrangement of blocks is supported 
so that code execution will update the appropriate set of blocks
	* A smarter plot layout (that will eventually be attached to a plot 
management panel)

I'm sure I've missed other things so I encourage y'all to check it out 
at its new home http://statpaper.sf.net
You can also check out a copy from CVS in the usual SourceForge manner 
(the OpenMath package is also in CVS)

Feedback is, as always, welcome.

Update R-1.7.0 package:

1: I accidentally made the previous version relocatable, which means 
you had
to choose where to install it. That's just asking for trouble. The new 
version just
chooses / for you.

2. Updated various CRAN packages, for instance XML (which requires some
hacking). Haven't done RODBC and gstat yet, which also require extra 
attention.
