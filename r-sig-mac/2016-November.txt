The problem persists, especially after working with R fro a long time.

I just got this message from the console after force quitting and reopening R:

Message-ID: <CA+dpOJkisGgDCJMM0M1N92jyCODm4ArJMjrRdA=cfAZ-HSmOAA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I was wondering if there is any R way to open/close (forcibly) any
file (preferably Excel) within Mac. I have tried with system()
function, however it generates error saying ".. No such file or
directory" since I have <<space>> in the underlying folder name.

Can anyone here please help me with some workaround particularly on
how to handle Space in file/folder name.

Thanks for your time.

Thanks, working perfectly. Any idea on forcibly closing that same file
through R.

Thanks again.

Issue an applescript event to Excel to tell it to close the file. You
can do that from the system command, but it's really not R-related
(it's more about how to issue apple events from the command line).

I had something similar earlier this week (also on Sierra).  I was in touch with Simon who suggested it might be a bad workspace image, so you can try to remove any .RData or .rda files.  However, in my case it was not that (I don?t save workspace images or histories for that matter).  But I removed all of those from my entire computer anyway and the problem remained (a few were left on shared drives by others who were saving workspace images).

Ultimately I was able to trace the problem to something being wrong with the ?recent? list.  In my case R.gui was trying to open the most recent file in the list, but something about the link to it was corrupted.  I verified this by running R from the command line and sourcing the file that seemed to be associated with the crash.  It worked fine, so the file was not the problem.

So, here?s what worked for me: When R.gui is asking you for a ?selection? to close down, see if the File -> Open Recent? option can still be selected, and if so, go all the way down to the clear menu item.  Once this list of recently opened files was empty, R.gui ran fine.  In my case not all files would clear from the list.  There was one left, and it was the one apparently causing the problem.  I renamed it so R.gui couldn?t use it/find it, and then the problem was gone.  Again, there was nothing wrong with the file, there was something wrong with the ?remembering?.

A few days later, I had to repeat this process when the problem re-occurred.  There may be something genuinely conflicted between Sierra and R.gui, only time will tell.  If it proves to be a widespread problem more observations should help narrow it down.  But this is what I experienced and how I fixed it.

Sorry, I should add that when you rename the offending file you need to change its extension, otherwise R will follow the file.

>>> Original Message:

I had something similar earlier this week (also on Sierra).  I was in touch with Simon who suggested it might be a bad workspace image, so you can try to remove any .RData or .rda files.  However, in my case it was not that (I don?t save workspace images or histories for that matter).  But I removed all of those from my entire computer anyway and the problem remained (a few were left on shared drives by others who were saving workspace images).

Ultimately I was able to trace the problem to something being wrong with the ?recent? list.  In my case R.gui was trying to open the most recent file in the list, but something about the link to it was corrupted.  I verified this by running R from the command line and sourcing the file that seemed to be associated with the crash.  It worked fine, so the file was not the problem.

So, here?s what worked for me: When R.gui is asking you for a ?selection? to close down, see if the File -> Open Recent? option can still be selected, and if so, go all the way down to the clear menu item.  Once this list of recently opened files was empty, R.gui ran fine.  In my case not all files would clear from the list.  There was one left, and it was the one apparently causing the problem.  I renamed it so R.gui couldn?t use it/find it, and then the problem was gone.  Again, there was nothing wrong with the file, there was something wrong with the ?remembering?.

A few days later, I had to repeat this process when the problem re-occurred.  There may be something genuinely conflicted between Sierra and R.gui, only time will tell.  If it proves to be a widespread problem more observations should help narrow it down.  But this is what I experienced and how I fixed it.

Hi Bryan,

I appreciate your detailed explanation.  I am not an R expert, I do not
know how to fix the R.gui you mentioned.

I kept on opening and closing R, after a dozen tries, the error went away
temporarily.  I still get the error, but it was not every time.

Since then, I have upgraded to R version 3.3.2 (2016-10-31).

I think this problem may come back, please let me know when you find a
solution.  Thank you!

No problem, glad to try to help.

There probably isn?t a problem with R.gui itself (when you ?run R? on a Mac by clicking the icon you are causing your computer to actually run the R.gui which in turn is running R under the hood).

So if the problem re-occurs, note the name of the most recent file (it probably was opened when you launched R prior to R faulting).  Then find that file and change the extension (temporarily).  Then try to launch R again and I expect it will not have a problem.

Hi Bryan,

Right after I wrote the email, I restarted R and the problem came back.  I
guess I jinx-ed my luck. ;)

The funny thing is, I did not even have a Rscript, it was just the stand
alone R console.  I was actually using it as a calculator.

I always thought OS X is more compatible with R than Windows, who knows. :(

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] gputools package installation on Mac perhaps fixed
Message-ID: <D30B9086-CC76-4EA9-AA76-673738DC3D5F@comcast.net>

My old video card was dying and I got a donation of an older nVidia card (NVIDIA Quadro FX 5600 1536 MB) I tried installing gputools from source using current CRAN image. Had earlier installed the most recent CUDA compiler version 8  (cuda_8.0.47_mac_network-dmg). The CRAN pages says no version is available. I'm currently working with R 3.3.1 patched on an El Cap version 10.11.6 (15G1108) using an early 2008 MacPro.  Ran into compiler difficulties with the source image, but after corresponding with Josh Buckner and sharing the installation logs and errors he tweaked some of the configure file and  built a new version that does compile (with many warnings that he says are all safe to ignore). He suggests trying the github version 1.2 and posting any difficulties there:

install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("nullsatz/gputools")

He suggested announcing that we did this together, but I think all the intellectual credit goes to him and the other authors.

It might be worth trying to launch R with lldb attached. You can run
the following command from the terminal:

    /usr/bin/lldb -w -n R

Then, try launching R (or R.app) -- 'lldb' should then detect that R
has been launched, and you can enter 'c' in the 'lldb' terminal window
to continue execution. Once R crashes / segfaults, you should
hopefully get a nice backtrace that may provide some actionable
information on how the bug could be fixed. The backtrace can normally
be printed using 'bt' in the lldb console. If lucky, that backtrace
should show exactly what code is causing the crash, and could give
some hints on how the crash could be resolved.

If you're not familiar with lldb, http://lldb.llvm.org/tutorial.html
gives a nice tutorial.

Best,
Kevin

I have also had this issue since upgrading. Recently it's got so bad that I
just hit escape and continue working while saving my script as often as I
can remember in hopes that it doesn't freeze completely.

I deleted my script history as mentioned and indeed it prevented it from
coming up with the error until I opened about 3 files and then it started
again.

As Kevin suggested I opened it with libd and recorded the following. When
it loaded with libd it caught something and loaded R normally without an
error. I opened the same file and it "crashed" again. I reopened with libd
and it caught another similar error (below).

I hope that is helpful.

P.S. I will upgrade to 3.3.2 shortly so this may be resolved with that.

After playing around with R.app for a bit, I was able to get myself
into a state where R.app was either dying or hanging on startup. I did
the following:

   1. Open R.app,
   2. Open a new R document (using the icon in the top menu bar --
'Create a new, empty document in the editor' ),
   3. Write and execute some code -- in my case, 'x <- 1; print(x)',
executed with Cmd + Enter,
   4. (optionally) Repeat steps 2 and 3, creating new documents and
executing more code,
   5. Focus a different application,
   6. Attempt to open an R document (using the menu bar again --
'Source script or load data in R',
   7. Observe that R.app is now hanging.

Note that if you run these repro steps, you may see R segfault / die
on startup (although in some cases all was fine). Note that step 5 is
necessary (IIUC) to force R.app to attempt to save the application
state.

It looks like R.app stores session state in the folder

    ~/Library/Saved Application State/org.R-project.R.savedState

My hypothesis at this point is that this saved state is somehow
getting corrupted. Removing that folder seems to resolve any startup
crashes I see.

As for the 'Open File' dialog hang, here's what I believe are the
relevant bits of an lldb stack trace I see:

I was wondering if anyone on the core r-sig-mac developer's group has a fix
to this.

For now, I can get by with RStudio, but to be honest, I like the native R,
very used to it.  Thanks!

Message-ID: <CB6F45CC-9219-4613-B30B-56FC4AE6F54C@utdallas.edu>

Hello,

I?m running R (3.3.1) with R-Studio (0.99.903) and Xquatrz (2.7.11) on my Macbook Pro with macOS Sierra (10.12.1).

I?m facing a weird problem, after installing basic packages such as ? car, plyr, etc. They get installed just fine when I use install.packages() command but the problem comes when I?m calling the package using library() command. As soon as I run this command (ex: library(car)), R crashes and I have to restart R again. I tried installing and re-installing all the applications (R, R-studio and X-Quartz) but can?t get around the problem.

Can you please help me?

Note: I?m not very technically sound in these issues and a solution explained in a layman language will be much appreciated.

Thanks,
Chaitanya

1) You are asking about R-studio which is different GUI - so if you want
to get this solved, w=you have to ask on their mailing list.

Now to your problem: 

R-GUI: R for 3.2.4 GUI 1.67 Mavericks build (7152)


In R console: I can load the package car
In RStudio  : I can load the package car
in R-GUI    : R crashes with the following info:

So something is not proper here.

In general: trying to load a package which is not present results in a

R, R-GUI, and RStudio are all installed using homebrew.

I can do further tests if needed.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] New problem with R and java affects loading xlsx
Message-ID: <D44F7821.18F472%macqueen1@llnl.gov>

I wonder if anyone here has a moment to send me any clues regarding the
following. I'd appreciate it.

Thanks!


Over the weekend my institution ran some updates, and now, today, I'm
having Java-related problems.

I've run
 R CMD javareconf
apparently successfully, and reinstalled
 rJava
 xlsx
 xlsxjars
also apparently successfully.

But now:
> library(xlsx)
JavaVM: requested Java version ((null)) not available. Using Java at ""
instead.
JavaVM: Failed to load JVM: /bundle/Libraries/libserver.dylib
JavaVM FATAL: Failed to load the jvm library.
Error : .onLoad failed in loadNamespace() for 'xlsx', details:
  call: .jinit()
  error: JNI_GetCreatedJavaVMs returned -1

Error: package or namespace load failed for 'xlsx'

I will be enquiring of our IT people.

I acknowledge my R is not current, and I will update it if other efforts
fail -- but this was working as of a week ago, so I'm not inclined to make
that my first step.

JDK and JRE 1.7 are marked by our institutional software management tool
as installed on the machine.

Never mind.
I tried some other combination of package re-installation and it's good
now.
Sorry for the spam.

I have been using R for the last five years and is my favorite platform for computations and simulations. My question:

I am an Apple user and since the upgrade to 10.8, I am now using 10.12.1 (16B2555) macOS Sierra, i have been getting this error message when I try to execute a command from the document editor.

2016-11-16 10:32:52.467 R[10235:1165417] *** WARNING: Method convertPointFromBase: in class NSView is deprecated on 10.7 and later. It should not be used in new applications. 

Is there something I could do, or have not done to avoid this error.

Thanks

Kirk this has been reported previously but apparently doesn't affect many users. You can ignore it safely. Bryan

Sent from an undisclosed location - check with the NSA.

It should probably be fixed at some point. For one thing, the method might actually disappear in a future version of the OS, but there are also some hints that it might misbehave on Retina displays (haven't seen it actually do that, though). It's one of those things that has lingered on while we supported Snow Leopard.

For one thing, the method might actually disappear in a future version of the OS, but there are also some hints that it might misbehave on Retina displays (haven't seen it actually do that, though). It's one of those things that has lingered on while we supported Snow Leopard.

Hi, On MacOs X Sierra my R crashed, reopening it, it showed a file 
myscript[Autosaved].R then trying to save this without the [Autosaved] 
it crashed again .... and now I can't recover my last version, i.e. I 
can see the the myscript.R from 3 or 4 hours ago. Can I locate the 
changes somewhere to recover the almost very last version of the file? 
thanks, Didier

Didier,

do you have anything in the crash reports? Most of the autosave/recovery is automated by the system, so it's really done by the OS, not by R itself - the best bet is to look into
~/Library/Autosave Information
(you can use <Cmd><Shift><G> in Finder and then type ~/Library as it's invisible by default) - if your'e lucky it will have 'Unsaved R Document.R' with the contents.
However, if the OS can't recoer it anymore it's not clear that it still exists, unfortunately.

Cheers,
Simon

Nothing there. I am also surprised of the last modified file as I think 
I had done some <cmd ><S> between 10 am and 4pm?

I found a NoteStore.sqlite with about the same time as the crash 
searching for  'modified Files' but this could be Zotero?

thanks anyway.

I actually noticed that

If I start R from opening that script file it crashes (

*** caught segfault ***
address 0x18, cause 'memory not mapped'

Possible actions:
1: abort (with core dump, if enabled)
2: normal R exit
3: exit R without saving workspace
4: exit R saving workspace
 >
Selection: )

but if I open R from the Dock there is no crash ... From there I 
modified the starting folder and now I can open R from opening that file 
etc...

So is there something left in the folder whre the file is or in the 
starting folder which  caused the crash? ... IS the answer in .First or 
Rprofile?

(I don't I have a .First)

Didier

Isn't that a system shortcut? That's likely entirely unrelated to R but rather your OS - did you upgrade your macOS recently? Check System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts

Is the packaging code available that is used to generate the standard apple installer packages, e.g. HYPERLINK "http://r.research.att.com/mavericks/R-3.3-branch/R-3.3-branch-mavericks.pkg"R-3.3-branch-mavericks.pkg?

 

I've had a look through the R for MAC OS X Developers information + FAQs etc but not come across the details.

 

Many thanks,

Dear all, 

the recent versions of R-gui trigger the usage of the dedicated GPU, which unnecessarily drains the battery. The fix is very simple: set the 	NSSupportsAutomaticGraphicsSwitching to true in the Info.plist. Also: https://developer.apple.com/library/content/qa/qa1734/_index.html <https://developer.apple.com/library/content/qa/qa1734/_index.html>

Would be nice if this got fixed in a future release!

Do you mean there is difficulty _installing_ one or both of these? Or was the difficulty seen during an attempt to _load_ them? What were the commands used? Without seeing the commands, there may be a problem with English parsing of your statements. The warning and error messages appear to come from efforts to install the 'rgl' package. I don't see rgl in either of the packageDescription() returns from those packages but I suppose it's possible that one of their dependencies has a "second level" dependency that needs to be fixed.

Those messages seem more likely to have been prompted by installing from "source". Why you would need to do that is unclear because both packages are available in binary form at least versions 1.3-6 (rugarch) and 3010.82.1(FGarch)

Do you have XCode and the Command Line Tools installed? Installation of the CLTs do require an additional step after the correct XCode version is installed. And do you have a recent version of XQuartz? XQuartz is the Mac version of X11 and that the warning before the error is making reference to failed efforts.

I realize these are mostly questions rather than answers, but you have no offered the code you used or any description of your setup. The Posting Guide suggests that you need to post the output of sessionInfo() and give answers to all the questions above.

Copying back to the list. (You should now read the Posting Guide which says you should post in plain text rather than in HTML and copy the list rather than responding only to an individual.)

So is this the Revolution R (aka Microsoft R) installation? (You are asked to provide complete details on your installation.)

So it doesn't look like this was an attempt to install from source what follows certainly looks like a source install with an incompletely configured system, but I don't know how RevoR operates.

You didn't answer the question about whether you had a recent version of XQuartz. Please go back to my first message and fill in all the gaps about this question and the other questions.
