CamiScript is an Input Manager. Input Managers are loaded by ALL Cocoa
applications, not just the application that is intended.

First, please don't spam mailing lists. Your behavior is rude to say  
the least. Then fix your system settings (hint: don't set  
DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH unless you really know what you're doing and what  
its implications are).

	Hi all,

	I want to check if this is a bug for which I should file a report.

	I am using R2.5.0 on OS X 10.4.9.  When I invoke the data editor and  
when I change the values of individual cells, it seems to work as  
intended.  However, when I try to delete/add a row/column, R.app  
crashes.  I've attached the crash log.

Best,

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Version differences in filename completion behavior
Message-ID: <p06230900c285fa376c02@[128.115.153.6]>

Hello,

I am seeing a difference between R versions in how filename 
completion performs. Specifically, something that worked in 2.3.1, 
which I built from sources, does not work in the CRAN binary 2.5.0. 
(Apparently, I skipped versions 2.4.x and went directly from 2.3.1 to 
2.5.0, so I can't speak to the behavior in 2.4.x.)

This may be due to the CRAN binary using libedit from Apple instead 
of GNU readline?
(from the R for OS X faq: "Nevertheless, GNU readline has some 
additional functionality so it may be worth installing anyway.")

Details:

Suppose I have files of R code in my working directory named:
     foo-bar.r
     ugh.bar.r

I want to source these files using, e.g.,
     source('foo-bar.r')
     source('ugh.bar.r')

In my R 2.3.1 (built from source), command line completion (by 
hitting the tab key) worked for both files.
That is, after typing
    source('foo-b
or
    source('ugh.b
and then hitting TAB, the filename completed.

In R 2.5.0 (binary), filename completion works for
    source('ugh.b
but not for
    source('foo-b
I hit the tab key, and it beeps but does nothing.

Since I have been in the habit of using (and desire to use) hyphens 
in file names, it would be nice to have both.

I tried to find out which version of readline my build of 2.3.1 one 
used, and couldn't find version info in any of the logs. But I do 
have libreadline.5.0.dylib from fink in /sw/lib, whereas Apple seems 
to supply libedit.dylib in /usr/lib, so maybe my build and the CRAN 
binary are using different libraries. More than likely, I would 
guess... And maybe Apple's doesn't support completion with hyphens.

Thanks
-Don

Don,

first, you failed to tell us how you use R. There are several ways  
(R.app, R from the shell, ESS, ...) and each uses a different way to  
auto-complete. My wild guess is that you mean the second method  
(based on your false statement about CRAN binary and libedit) and in  
that case I can just repeat what has been said before ( http:// 
tolstoy.newcastle.edu.au/R/e2/devel/07/04/3027.html ) - please read  
the NEWS.

Cheers,
Simon

Thank you, Simon.
I did search for information before posting, of course, but

Message-ID: <p0624081dc28b85cb1dc2@[165.124.165.220]>

Dear Dear R-Mac users,
   In the past I have reported difficulties using Rgraphviz because of 
problems loading various libraries.  I think I have found at least 
one source of the problem.

  In addition to the standard packages that need to be downloaded and 
installed from bio-conductor, it turns out that an important 
additional library is found in the X-code library for the Mac. 
Installing X-Code allows Rgraphviz to load.

This might account for the recommendation to compile Rgraphviz from 
source, because that would entail using X-code.

Thanks to Seth and Simon for such hard work getting Rgraphviz to work 
on the Mac.

Bill

Bill,

can you, please, be more specific?
Are you using the Graphviz binary from http://r.research.att.com/  
(which is what the CRAN binary is compiled against)? What is the  
library dependency you are talking about?

Thanks,
Simon

Simon,

Sorry not to have been more specific.  I can no longer give the error 
messages I was getting but I will try tomorrow on a machine that does 
not yet have X-code .   I was partly responding to a thread started 
back around 2/15/07 about problems loading Rgraphviz.

I have been using it on a MacBook pro for several weeks.  It had 
worked on my G5 desktop until a complete hard disk failure.  After 
reloading they system (but with out Xcode), Rgraphviz did not load. 
With Xcode installed, it did.   Similarly, a student of mine could 
not load Rgraphiviz, but with Xcode installed was able to do so.

The error message I was getting was very similar to one that I 
reported on January 19th and other people have reported since then:
"
Error in dyn.load(x, as.logical(local), as.logical(now)) :
	unable to load shared library
'/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.4/Resources/library/Rgraphviz/libs/i386/Rgraphviz.so':

dlopen(/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.4/Resources/library/Rgraphviz/libs/i386/Rgraphviz.so,
6): Symbol not found: _agfstnode
    Referenced from:

    Expected in: dynamic lookup
Error: .onLoad failed in 'loadNamespace' for 'Rgraphviz'
Error: package/namespace load failed for 'Rgraphviz'"

I can not guarantee that the specific message has been identical to 
this but will try tomorrow on a machine without Xcode.

I downloaded Rgraphviz from bio-conductor (plus all the required 
files).  Installed 2.12 from  http://r.research.att.com/.  Nothing 
worked until adding Xcode from the 10.4 system disk.


Rgraphviz  now works like a charm on all machines that have X-code 
installed, but on none that do not.

Best wishes,

Bill

Simon,
   A followup to the Rgraphviz issue and why I think installing X-Code 
solves at least one problem with getting it to work

On a G4 Powerbook I updated R to 2.5.0 patched. I then went to 
bio-conductor and downloaded Rgraphviz and all the associated 
packages.  Then installed graphviz 2.1.2 from 
http://r.research.att.com/.


However,
Without X-Code installed, when I try library(Rgraphviz) I get the 
following error message:


library(Rgraphics)
Error in library(Rgraphics) : there is no package called 'Rgraphics'
Loading required package: graph
Loading required package: geneplotter
Loading required package: annotate
Loading required package: Biobase

At which point any calls to Rgraphviz work perfectly. (And it is well 
worth loading for it makes some very nice graphs).

This was done using R version 2.5.0 Patched (2007-04-25 r41315)
(just installed R 2.5.0 today on the G4 power book that had this problem. )

  As I said yesterday, when my students or I installed X-Code on G4s, 
G5s, or MacBook Pros, then we were able to load Rgraphviz.  Once 
loaded, it works like a charm.

Best wishes,

Bill

Ken,

you may want to ask the package maintainer about that sort of  
questions. AFAICS the package works only if GNU Sci Lib is installed  
as a system library. The configure in the gsl package is just a fake,  
really, because it tests LIBS but doesn't modify Makevars  
accordingly, so it's useless (it tests the wrong thing with the wrong  
compiler). You can as well remove it and edit Makevars to match your  
configuration (you may have to add PKG_CPPFLAGS as well).

Cheers,
Simon

This may have been asked before, but I seem to have no real font  
control on my MacPro with R.

If I change it using Format --> Fonts --> smaller  it only changes  
previous lines and then reverts to large font on the command line.
I get similar behavior using the Show Fonts command.

How can I globally change the command window font consistently?

Thx,
Dick De Veaux

brackets.  If I enter between the {} brackets and start with the if 
(), the editor finishes the () next the ending } and then "crashes"   
with the following error in the console, leaving the editor capable  
of saving, but not of typing any more.

2007-06-07 21:55:01.974 R[821] Exception raised during posting of  
notification.  Ignored.  exception: -[NSLayoutManager  
_fillGlyphHoleAtIndex:desiredNumberOfCharacters:] *** attempted glyph  
generation while textStorage is editing.  It is not valid to cause  
the layoutManager to do glyph generation while the textStorage is  
editing (ie the textStorage has been sent a beginEditing message  
without a matching endEditing.)


I think this is repeatable, and hopefully helpful.

FWIW: gsl is now available as Mac binary from CRAN without the need  
for the GNU Scientific Library to be installed (as it is statically  
linked).

Cheers,

The problem is then apparently somewhere earlier - do you have a  
proper Fortran compiler installed? Apparently the fortran object file  
is not created correctly. Please send me the full output (and tell me  
which Fortran you are using and how you installed it).

Cheers,
Simon

PS: I'm moving this to R-SIG-Mac as this is Mac-specific.

Ken,

you should be using the JGR mailing list for such questions, because  
this is not an R question (see posting guide).

Please let us know which versions you are using [see sessionInfo()]  
and how you start it.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] R will crash if it is started by opening a source file
	from Finder or Spotlight
Message-ID: <20070608181336.46A7924FB12@dhcp-n24f.lhsc.on.ca>


To reproduce this bug:
1. Make sure R.app is not running
2. Open any R source file through Finder or Spotlight
3. R crashes

It is interesting to note that opening the same file using the "open"
command in terminal.app will NOT crash R. Also, the above steps will
not cause R to crash if R is already running.

Message-ID: <2DEF563A-F9C3-4EDD-A39F-0834C0A0ADE3@fhcrc.org>

I know other have brought up tcltk issues in the past, but I hadn't  
encountered them until I installed the most recent version of R.app  
(with the R-2.5.0.dmg).  The issue arises when I try to load the  
Bioconductor "marray" package:

 > library(marray)
Loading required package: tkWidgets
Loading required package: widgetTools
Loading required package: tcltk
Loading Tcl/Tk interface ... Error in fun(...) : couldn't connect to  
display ":0"
Error : .onLoad failed in 'loadNamespace' for 'tcltk'
Error: package 'tcltk' could not be loaded

Curiously, the error does not occur in X11, and it also does not  
occur in R.app if X11 is running simultaneously.

The tcltk package uses the X11 windowing system to work.  That is why
you do not see the error if X11 is running.  You already have the
fix--start X11 before using tcltk.

That's because display ":0" is the X11 display. At last check AquaTk
and R fight over the menu bar.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] query re ">" in Sweave output for Mac input
Message-ID: <p0624081fc2962823f8cb@[165.124.162.136]>

Dear R Mac users,

When writing examples for students, I typically use Sweave to 
integrate the R code with the output.  R code from Sweave 
conventionally is preceded by the  prompt character (typically ">"). 
Although this can be suppressed in Sweave, it seems as if the 
conventional style is to include the prompt on every example line. 
This leads to a syntax error on every line copied from a Sweave 
example directly into R.

Now my question:

Is there some option in the Mac R-Gui that I have missed that allows 
me to directly paste Sweave output of commands (i.e., including the 
prompt) into R without first editing them out in the editor?  I think 
that this is possible in Windows (but have only been told that by my 
students).

If it is not possible, then what do people think about example code 
not including the prompt?   It  makes it easier to cut and paste from 
sample text, but makes it harder to spot the code in the sample text. 
(For my web based examples I get around this by color coding the R 
commands , but I am worrying about pdf examples).

Thanks for suggestions and help.

Bill

Do you know of

R CMD Stangle <filename>.Rnw

which extracts the R code into a file <filename>.R?

Doug,

I don't think Stangle is what I am looking for, for I want my 
students to read (e.g.) a chapter I am writing (set in pdf after 
Sweave and LateX), copy the R code from the chapter and then run it.

I can just  have the Sweave not issue the prompt for every line, but 
that seems to violate the conventional style of writing examples.

Thanks

Bill

Another option is to give students the .R file produced using
Stangle.  The disadvantage is this is a separate file and students
will need to keep track of which chunk to copy/paste.  In addition to
solving the prompt related syntax errors, it encourages students to
make small changes to the code to explore questions and this can have
a lot of value.

No, but it is on the wishlist
http://wiki.r-project.org/rwiki/doku.php?id=misc:wishlist-mac

Unfortunately I don't think I'll have time to look into this soon,  
but patches of R.app implementing this are highly welcome.

Cheers,
Simon

And for anyone interested in doing this, I'd suggest starting with the 
code for "Paste commands only" that Tony Plate contributed to the 
Windows Rgui, which is mostly in the CleanTranscript function in

https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/src/gnuwin32/console.c

It would probably make some sense to move this function into src/main, 
since it's not really Windows-specific.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] r_arch
Message-ID: <28A06130-7D4B-43C3-8B71-61C48C5316DA@stat.berkeley.edu>

Hi

I am using the CRAN binary of R-2.5.0 together with the supplied  
gfortran and the latest Xcode on a PPC mac running OS X 10.4.9. In my  
~/.profile I have
   export R_ARCH=/ppc

It seems as if the default of R nowadays is to build universal  
binaries of packages. At least when I try to install a source package  
on my PPC system, it starts by stating
** arch - i386
and then calls g++-4.0 with "-arch i386" (this is for a package  
containing C++ code). Later on it says
** arch - ppc
and then calls g++-4.0 with "-arch ppc".

I now have a couple of questions:

1) How do I make R only compile the ppc binaries - there is not much  
use for doing the i386 compilation when I install it on my powerbook  
and since it is slow at compiling, I would like to avoid this  
(especially in package development). I have (as stated above) set  
R_ARCH (perhaps wrongly) and have also tried with a
   R --arch=ppc CMD INSTALL
as per R-admin. And can I get that setting "stored" somewhere - it  
seems as if the default build for the CRAN binary is for the i386  
achitecture.

2) I am also the maintainer of the Bioconductor package affxparser.  
That package has subdirectory of the /src directory containing an  
entire SDK. In the /src directory we have a Makevars file containing  
additional targets so that the SDK files (in /src/fusion_sdk and  
subdirectories) gets compiled. This used to work. But these days, if  
I compile the package under PPC, it only compiles everything in /src/ 
fusion_sdk with -arch i386. The additional PPC run only compiles the  
files in /src. This means of course that the package does not work  
under PPC. I assume I will need to do some additional magic in our  
Makevars file, but I have no idea what. I have added our current  
Makevars file below. The problem with this is also in the BioC  
binaries from Simon's website, which installs fine but bails out with  
an error when I do
R> library(affxparser)

Any ideas?

FWIW it's superfluous and has no effect on ppc machines, see below.

There is no "default build". The CRAN version of R is modified in  
that respect that the R start script has
: ${R_ARCH=/`arch`}
so the default r_arch is ppc in your case (this is why typing R  
actually works).

As of builds, the archs are built in an alphabetical order (and i  
comes before p).

If you don't mind having single-arch R, you can just remove $R_HOME/ 
bin/exec/i386, that should cause INSTALL to forget about i386.  
Previous CRAN binaries used a modified INSTALL script that didn't  
build i386 on ppc, because ppc systems lack i386 libraries. R 2.5.0  
binary now uses 10.4u SDK so you can build i386 binaries and hence we  
use the regular INSTALL script from R.

R cleans up only src. If you have object files in other places, you  
have to clean them yourself or use R_ARCH for the build or a dependency.

FWIW: this behavior is in place for several releases now, so I'm  
wondering you didn't notice it earlier ... ;)

I upgraded to R version 2.5.0 (2007-04-23) just now, and the R.app  
crashes every time I try to open Packages&Data-->Data Manager. The  
problem is reproducible.

Thanks for your time and help,

Message-ID: <3f547caa0706170704s2fb329d8y6efecee616641500@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm going to be switching to a Mac - fed up with windows issues. I
originally posted this on the BUGS forum but received no response.
Perhaps the R-SIG-Mac list is more appropriate.

>From searching the archives, I know I can run Win/OpenBugs on a mac using
parallels and can use OpenBugs on a mac using Wine. But my question is
somewhat different.

I'd like to be able to run winbugs or openbugs from within R on my mac without
having to be in the windows environment. Does anyone know if it is
possible to run OpenBugs via BRugs, or Winbugs via R2WinBugs, on a
Mac? If so, how does one accomplish it? Thanks in advance,

Matt

In general, probably not or at least not without a lot of work. I've
never really looked, but if the BUGS stuff is separate and the R
library simply executes an external copy, it might be possible to use
the Oberon->JVM compiler to get a running version of BUGS and then go
from there. I've never tried it though.

The most recent version of VMWare Fusion (beta), which is much like 
Parallels, has the ability to run in a mode where you can put a 
Windows app in the Dock, and start if from there as if it were a Mac 
app. This seems to me like it might be a step in the direction you 
want to go, but I don't know if it can go far enough.

What if bugs were running in Wine on an intel mac? Would it be  
possible then?

I did have a look at this and it is not a runner.  There is little  
resemblance between current versions of Oberon and the Black Box  
framework used for Winbugs.  A better looking approach was using the  
Gardens Point Component Pascal compiler, but that was still going to  
involve rewriting a lot of Black Box functions.

Although you can run Windows/Linux programs along with MacOS stuff on  
your Mac they could only communicate via a network socket or  
similar.  Again that would need a lot of work.

Have you looked at JAGS?  http://www-ice.iarc.fr/~martyn/software/jags/

It will run quite a lot of BUGS code as it is.  The latest  
sourceforge code will run even more and has better samplers.  Martyn  
Plummer is actively working on it.  It uses the R maths library and  
is designed to eventually be an R package.  There is plenty of  
support for it already available in R.  It will build simply enough  
on MacOS X if you have a current R distribution and the included  
compiler installed.  If you have problems, email me.

Hi,

I don't know what your status is on your issue but I'd like to report  
that I managed to circumvent mine by using Doug Lea's malloc instead  
of the standard one.

Although R seems to be a bit slower (but not by much), at least it  
does not crash or go into infinite loops anymore when dealing with  
large objects.


Best,

Vivek, 

is there any reason that forces you to compile R yourself? In most cases (as
I see it), you don't have to. The easiest and fastest way to get a
ready-to-use installation of R on your PowerPC is to use the binary
installer you can find on CRAN [www.r-project.org > CRAN > _choose a mirror
from the list_ > MacOS X > _choose a binary distribution package, I
recommend 'R-2.5.0.dmg (latest version)'_ ]

Using a binary distribution, the installation is a question of minutes,
never had any serious problems on my own Power PC (G4/400, Oct 1999 :-)

Note that R 2.5.1 is right in front of our doors, official release date was
set to 2007-06-28, the Mac version usually follows a few days later.

Hope this helps -- good luck!

Dear Vivekm

Is there a reason you are installing from source rather than a pre- 
compiled binary? Just download the .dmg and off you go.

Another issue, if you are compiling from source, is that you need the  
latest xCode tools. I had problems compiling rgdal from source (there  
is no binary for this package); I downloaded the new xCode (93Mb!!)  
and then everything worked smoothly.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Flushing the buffer?
Message-ID: <59D1A6B1-6E95-43B8-92CB-DC6968F55804@auckland.ac.nz>



Please reply to me directly since I don't subscribe to this list.

I am using an Imac, to which I am relatively new, and have  
encountered somewhat puzzling behaviour.
I wrote a script to source in order to do a simulation, and put in a  
``cat'' statement in a for-loop to
let me know how things were progressing.  The strange behaviour was  
that the output from the
``cat()s'' seemed to be buffered, and did not appear on the screen  
until the whole procedure
completed.  Which is pretty  useless.

The funny thing is I'm pretty sure that I did exactly the same thing  
last week, and the buffering
behaviour did not occur.  I don't *think* I changed any settings, but  
something must have changed.
Can anyone suggest how I might change things back or otherwise over- 
ride the buffering.
I tried putting in a call to flush.console(), but that has no effect.

The output from sessionInfo() is as follows:

R version 2.5.0 (2007-04-23)
i386-apple-darwin8.9.1

locale:
C

attached base packages:
[1] "stats"     "graphics"  "grDevices" "utils"     "datasets"   
"methods"
[7] "base"

other attached packages:
    misc
"0.0-1"

One other thing:  If I replace the cat() statements by print()  
statements, then the buffering
does not seem to occur.  This strikes me as very weird.

Here is a toy example:

for(r in 1:20) {
         X <- sum(rnorm(1e6))
         cat(r,"")
}
cat("\n")

The buffering phenomenon occurs whether I put the forgoing code in a  
file and source that file,
or type the code directly into the console.

Any ideas?  Thanks.

				cheers,

					Rolf Turner

Message-ID: <3f547caa0706280732o52133a3fodaa7ac1737ab4d55@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm a recent convert, still trying to get used to this new OS. I use R
everyday for my work.

I have a new Intel MacBook Pro, and installed R 2.5.0. Using the GUI,
when I try to open a large *.R script (from File -> Open or by double
clicking the file), it takes about 1-2 minutes to open. The script is
about 3000 lines long and there are very long and nested loops in it.
Files that are shorter open increasingly quickly, so this behavior
seems to be a function of script length. Still, it takes a text editor
less than a second to open the 3000 lines long file.

Does anyone have any ideas on what might be causing this? Does the Mac
version of R run some kind of code automatically when script files are
opened? Thanks in advance...

Matt

Perhaps Simon inserted code in the GUI to cause the delay, as a subtle
hint that 3000 line R scripts with very long and nested loops are to
be discouraged.  :-)

Matt,

Try opening the files with syntax coloring disabled (in the editor  
preferences).

Message-ID: <7098abec0706292231x783ac77aobd0aa15ed73fc52f@mail.gmail.com>

I've mentioned this little project to a few people off-list as
something I'd like to do for Leopard, but it occurred to me that there
is nothing particularly Leopard specific in this particular piece of
code. So, here we go:

RExecServer
http://www.stanford.edu/~bcellis/Homepage/R%20Execution%20Server.html

This project mostly comes out of a conversation I had with Stefano
about using multiple cores in the R GUI and Xgrid. The RExecServer is
a first step in that direction. It provides a true Cocoa application
that runs as a background server (so no Dock icon or menubar). The
user (that's you) communicates via either a normal stdio connection
(i.e. Terminal or ESS) or using Distributed Objects (for the GUI). In
this initial implementation only the stdio access is working.

To use it I recommend symlinking the shell script
RExecServer.app/Contents/Resources/RExecServer.sh to something handy
in either /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin so that you can get at it from
ESS or the Terminal. Then, just use as normal.

Things you get:

* Mostly a working, fully responsive, Quartz device. This Quartz
implementation is actually completely new so you may notice that
certain things are different. Particularly, the font metric
calculations are now improved---note the location of elements in
plotmath (particularly sum and product). Right now aliasing is turned
off, but that will be an option (I was experimenting with something).
It also doesn't update the screen until it's done processing so while
it feels slower it is actually much faster. There might be a few
clipping bugs, but we'll sort those out.

* A normal readline-based interface that can be used from ESS or
Terminal. You can also start multiple copies, though it presently
complains about Services. This is harmless though.

* Very low CPU usage when idle. I'm forced to use polling with
readline, but it doesn't appear to use very much. The event loop works
differently in this version so there is no need for a timer or
anything.

I'm not sure how much time I'll have, but here's what the design buys me:

* We can pipe bitmap and pdf output through the quartz device. This
means no more X11 required. Right now this isn't working, but the
infrastructure is in place.

* We can separate the GUI and R itself. This has pros and cons but I
think it will be a long term advantage, especially as we get more
cores.

Things I'd really like to do (again, time):

* Copy-n-paste objects between Servers. Using serialize/deserialize
and Distant Object or NSPasteboard connections

* Quicktime movie output device. This might wait for Leopard.

* If you poke around the link above you might find some other ideas. :-)

What this isn't:

* Intended as a complete GUI. That's mostly for the front-end
implementation which is a separate application. The graphics device is
intended to be very minimal for ESS users who want something better
than the old Aqua device.

* Anywhere near complete. You don't get lots of things right now. Like
command-line options. Any options at all really. Lots of safety things
aren't wired up either.


Let me know what you think and if you run into major trouble. The
build is Universal so it should also work on PPC.

True - maybe I should have added the message as well so the hint not  
as subtle ;).

Anyway, it's the syntax highlighting which runs synchronously on open  
and can be slow for long documents. I'm experimenting with  
asynchronous sh for the new GUI which should remedy this issue. As  
Rob noted, temporary remedy is to disable syntax highlighting for  
such documents.

Cheers,
Simon
