I can confirm that after the upgrade to Leopard 10.5.7, R 2.9.0 and R.app 
GUI (both installed from binary provided at CRAN by Simon) are working 
perfectly.
Thanks to all that reply to my previous e-mail.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Query MS SQL Server DB using RODBC from OS X
Message-ID: <B1BFC016-DDD7-4782-8A1B-197DC98A0A4B@me.com>

Everyone,

I would like to access from R running in OS X 10.5 a Microsoft SQL  
database that is running in Windows on a Parallels virtual machine.

The Parallels VM and the OS X are on the same Mac. A DSN is set up on  
Windows. Running queries on the VM itself with the Windows version of  
R using the RODBC package commands odbcConnect and sqlQuery works just  
fine.

Does anyone know how this can be done? How to make R in OS X aware of  
the Windows DSN? What ODBC driver works for OS X to get access to the  
Windows VM?

Appreciate the help.

Regards,
David

Technically, that's irrelevant, because they act as two separate  
computers - for all practical purposes you're connecting a Mac to a  
database on another PC over a network.

You'll need an ODBC driver for OS X capable of using Microsoft SQL.  
It's been a while since I used one (if I recall correctly it was the  
Actual one), but here are some links:

http://www.actualtechnologies.com/product_sqlserver.php
http://uda.openlinksw.com/odbc/express/odbc-sqlserver-ee/

Once the driver is installed, you can use ODBC Administrator utility  
to create a DSN on the Mac. (However, I have never really used ODBC in  
R since there are native R drivers for all databases I'm using ...).

Cheers,
Simon

Simon,

Is there an R driver for MS SQL Server?

I would urge you to contact Parallels and talk to their tech folks on  
this.

The challenge here is that the Windows VM essentially functions in a  
'sand box'. You can configure things like Coherence and shared folders  
and applications for convenience, but a Windows application is running  
in a logically separate Windows machine. With the exception of the  
aforementioned sharing at the file level, you really need to think of  
the scenario as being two separate computers.

This means that you would likely need to configure the Parallels  
networking configuration in such a fashion that the Windows VM is  
effectively seen on the local network as a separate computer with a  
separate IP address, on which MSSQL is running. I don't use Parallels  
(or VMWare or VirtualBox), but from a brief review of the Parallels  
documentation at:

   http://download.parallels.com/desktop/v4/docs/en/Parallels_Desktop_Users_Guide.pdf

there are options under Networking that would seem to perhaps  
facilitate the above. So in effect, OSX would see the Windows VM as a  
separate server on the network running MSSQL, to which you can connect  
as if you were connecting to a physically separate server.

If you can achieve that configuration, then you would need an ODBC  
driver for MSSQL that runs on OSX. I don't know if MS offers that or  
if you need to go to a third party. If the latter, Actual Technologies  
offers an ODBC driver for MSSQL for OSX:

   http://www.actualtechnologies.com/product_sqlserver.php

I use their Oracle ODBC driver to connect R on my MacBook Pro using  
RODBC, to our Oracle server and it works fine and was easy to configure.

Talk to the Parallels folks and they can give you more definitive  
guidance.

HTH,

Marc Schwartz

Marc,

I just downloaded the actual ODBC driver and will contact the  
Parallels people.
Thanks for the good advice.

Everyone,

I would like to access from R running in OS X 10.5 a Microsoft SQL  
database that is running in Windows on a Parallels virtual machine.

The Parallels VM and the OS X are on the same Mac. A DSN is set up on  
Windows. Running queries on the VM itself with the Windows version of  
R using the RODBC package commands odbcConnect and sqlQuery works just  
fine.

Does anyone know how this can be done? How to make R in OS X aware of  
the Windows DSN? What ODBC driver works for OS X to get access to the  
Windows VM?

Appreciate the help.

Regards,
David

There are others better at ODBC than I. None the less...

I think you have to set up a DSN on the Mac side that points to the 
Windows OS, just like for any remote host.  There should be a GUI app 
in your Utilities folder for specifying ODBC drivers and creating 
DSNs.

I don't know what ODBC driver you should use, but a bit of web 
searching will no doubt find some companies that will sell you one. 
Or maybe Microsoft includes one with Office for Mac, or maybe 
Microsoft has one you can download.

My ODBC configuration file is
   ~/Library/ODBC/odbc.ini

I'm not a big fan of toolbars with "few" features since they take away  
space unnecessarily (some of the old tools in R.app are bad  
enough ;)), but that's a matter of taste ...

Potentially useful - but not really on my priority list. However,  
contributions are welcome.

We have menus and shortcuts for those already ...

 From a UI point of view it's a bit questionable how to do that  
properly (having more independent devices in one window), yet, again  
if someone finds it useful [s]he should figure that out. However, you  
are aware of the history accessible via <Cmd><Left>/<Right> I suppose?

As the name suggests Quartz is implemented using Quartz, not PDF Kit.  
Quartz is more general and not limited to PDF.

Note that Quartz is a very modular infrastructure so you can even  
write a package that provides an enhanced Quartz on-screen window.  
Clearly if it was based on qdCococa it would be easy to fold it into R  
later. Also note that Quartz is part of R and not the GUI, so it will  
benefit all Mac users.

Cheers,
Simon

On the subject of the GUI's management of the quartz window, I am  
wondering if there is an option in the current controls that I could  
change somewhere that would bring the quartz window to the foreground  
when a new plot is displayed?

On the subject of possibly using Apple's PDFkit, I wondered whether it  
might have a benefit in off-loading from the Mac developers the  
programming details involved in creating the screen display and allow  
file creation. At the moment there is only one file format supported  
(pdf) and the copy function does not apparently create a clipboard  
file that OpenOffice.org can paste. I cannot be sure that both  
problems would be solved by using an Apple PDFkit interface. After  
looking at the PDFkit pages I am thinking neither would be immediately  
solved, and the path forward for me would be a mechanism for invoking  
the pdf device and triggering a system script for reopening the newest  
file in Preview, which would then offer me all the facilities I seek.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] profiling C shared libraries loaded into R
Message-ID: <79B210AC-9D06-453C-B9C3-112E6EAA32B3@mit.edu>

Hi.  I have a shared library that I would like to profile.  I see that  
this issue has been touched on in some previous posts, but I am still  
having trouble, and I am hoping someone here can help.

First things first...  I am running R 2.8.0 patched on OS X 10.5.7, on  
a dual quad-core Mac Pro.   It is the 64-bit binary build for Leopard,  
as downloaded from CRAN.

I am compiling my code using gcc-4.2, and I am including the -g -p -pg  
flags.  Optimization is turned off (-O0).  I AM able to debug the code  
using gdb (called as R -d gdb).  I always run R from the command line.

I have tried profiling using Shark, which recognizes functions in  
libR.dylib, but none of the functions in mylib.so.  For each function  
call, Shark refers to "Unknown Library", and after the function  
address, there is an indicator of [unknown].  Also, when I use Shark,  
it appears to want to profile the entire R session.  All I care about  
is my library.

I am also open to using gprof instead, but I cannot find the requisite  
gmon.out file.

Thanks in advance for any suggestions.

Michael

The -p -pg part (they are mutually-exclusive aren't they? so you get  
just -pg) won't really help unless you also compile R that way since  
the gprof initialization happens in the executable, not in the library  
(and don't forget it at link time).


>  Optimization is turned off (-O0).

Just to make sure - using PKG_CFLAGS doesn't have the desired effect,  
because R's -O2 will override it, so better be sure that the  
optimization is off. If you run the steps manually, make sure you have  
-g (and -pg if you wish) everywhere.

I'm unable to replicate that. Shark correctly recognizes the function  
and the loaded library for me. Try using default flags - they do  
include -g -O2 (which worked for me).

See above - you won't find it unless you compile R with -pg since the  
gprof init code must be in the executable (more precisely you don't  
have to re-compile the entire R with that, it should be sufficient to  
use -pg in the link step for exec/R).

Cheers,
Simon

Simon:

Thanks for your suggestion.  I recompiled R 2.9.0, including the -g  
and -pg flags everywhere.  I still do not see a gmon.out file in my  
working directory.  And now, Shark crashes as soon as it start  
analyzing the samples.  This occurs with any R job, not just my own  
shared lib.

Is there a way I can look after the fact to see if R was compiled  
correctly to support profiling?

Thanks,

Michael

Simon:

Sorry, please disregard my last email.  Shark was crashing because  
some of something with Shark, not R.  But unfortunately, the Unknown  
Libraries remain.

Here is how I compiled R.  In the config.site file, I set:

R_PAPERSIZE=letter
R_BATCHSAVE=--no-save
CC='gcc-4.2 -arch x86_64 -m64 -march=core2 -msse3 -g -pg -O2'
OBJC='gcc-4.2 -arch x86_64 -m64 -march=core2 -msse3 -g -pg -O2'
DEFS=-DHAVE_INLINE
F77='gfortran -arch x86_64 -g -pg -O2'
LIBnn=lib
CXX='g++-4.2 -arch x86_64 -march=core2 -p -pg -O2'
FC='gfortran -arch x86_64 -m64 -march=core2 -g -pg -O2'
TCLTK_LIBS=/usr/lib

To configure, I ran the following script

#!/bin/bash

./configure \
SHELL='/bin/bash' \
r_arch=x86_64 \
--with-system-zlib \
--with-blas='-framework vecLib' --with-lapack='-framework vecLib' \
--with-ICU \
--with-aqua \
--enable-R-framework \
--enable-BLAS-shlib \
--with-x \
--with-readline=/usr/local \
--with-tcltk \
--with-iconv=no \
--with-cairo \
--disable-R-profiling \
--with-recommended-packages=no


Any idea what I did wrong?

Thanks,

Michael

library/XML?



i also tried to install :

libxml2-sources-2.7.3

using no specific option in configure, just  : ./configure make make  
install (in usr/local) but the log seems to not changes.


  need i to add some "configure args" when installing XML pachage in R ?

[[elided Yahoo spam]]

regards,

Massimo Di Stefano.

You didn't set -pg for link-time* which is the crucial one (adding -pg  
to compile flags is not strictly necessary unless you want to profile  
R itself).

Also you may want to tweak the flags (CFLAGS et al.) instead of the  
compilers since they have higher precedence (also you have a typo in  
CXX). [And why the DEFS?]

Always check the output when your library is actually compiled - you  
may find your flags being overridden by others.

Cheers,
Simon


* you can use LDFLAGS or LIBS but in this instance MAIN_LDFLAGS may be  
more interesting, but I didn't test it.

Simon:

Now I'm having trouble getting R to compile at all.  I now set up my  
config.site file to something "bare bones."

CC='gcc-4.2 -arch x86_64'
OBJC='gcc-4.2 -arch x86_64'
F77='gfortran -arch x86_64'
CXX='g++-4.2 -arch x86_64'
FC='gfortran -arch x86_64'

I then use the same configure script as before.  I can compile, but  
then 'make check' fails with

BRAUNM2: ~/Downloads/R-2.9.0 $ make check

Collecting examples for package ?base?
Running examples in package ?base?
/Users/braunm/Downloads/R-2.9.0/bin/BATCH: line 59: 22777 Segmentation  
fault      ${R_HOME}/bin/R -f ${in} ${opts} ${R_BATCH_OPTIONS} > $ 
{out} 2>&1
Error: testing 'base' failed
Execution halted


Regardless, I did a sudo make install, and can still launch R, and  
load my shared libraries (no profiling, obviously).

Next, as suggested, I added a single line to config.site:

LDFLAGS='-g -pg'


'make' fails at the line

The same thing happens if I put the -g -pg flags in MAIN_LDFLAGS


As you can probably tell, I'm new to working with C, and I'm still  
learning the finer points of compilers and linkers.  Thanks again for  
helping me figure out what's going on here.

Which version of package XML is this?  For 2.5.0 at least, you need a 
more recent version of libxml2 (as the log you show does warn you).

The CRAN install log at

http://www.r-project.org/nosvn/R.check/r-release-macosx-ix86/XML-00install.html

shows the same problem for XML 2.5.1.

Ah, but note you have

> checking for xml2-config... /usr/bin/xml2-config

Is /usr/bin ahead of /usr/local/bin in your path?  I needed to change 
the path order.

Alternatively, XML 2.3.0 should work, and there is a binary on CRAN. 
(But some other Omegahat packages seem to need XML >= 2.5.0 without 
saying so: one is XMLschema on which SSOAP depends. OTOH, quite a few 
other packages are unhappy with XML 2.5.x.)

I moved ttemporary the xml2-config :

sudo mv /usr/bin/xml2-config /usr/bin/xml2-config.back

then done a simlink :

sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/ml2-config /usr/bin/

then i succesfull installed the needed packages (spgrass6)

... now i ripristinate the system libxml2

i hope the package will work  :-/

  ... or ripristinate the system libxml will broke the xml pamackage  
in R ?


any code strip to see if it continue to works as aspected ?

thanks !!!

Massimo Di Stefano


p.s.

how to change in R  the order of searching path ?
in usr local i've some libraries installed from source
that maybe are newer vdersion that the system version
...
i've some unix stuff installed in my framework too (gdal, jpeg,  
libtiff and others)
to install rgdal im using :  --with-configure-args option  in the R  
CMD install command
...
  it is possible to add frameworks to the R search-lib path ?

That's what I did (or rather the csh equivalent): it is just needed 
for the XML configure stage.

Yes, it can be a pain (I build it for Windows), but so much else 
relies on it.

No, Mac OS X's linker hardcodes the paths of dependent libraries, and 
in any case R adds /usr/local/lib to the dylib library path ahead of 
the system locations.

Nothing special about R: you set LD_LIBRARY_PATH or DYLIB_LIBRARY_PATH 
depending on what you are doing (and which OS).

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] R mac gui improvements

Dear Simon,

Thank you for your answer  (and once again, for this very nice gui you  
built, and which puts a few more colors in our daily work ;)

I definitely agree that my suggestion was not very mature? I would  
rephrase it this way:
	- why not adding zoom in, zoom out, and zoom to fit window size in  
the quartz menu (with scrollable plot when it's zoomed in, and  
keyboard shortcuts). This would allow to keep the resizing when window  
is enlarged above current zooming.
	- once this would be done, why not adding toolbar and contextual menu  
to give access to these functions (plus "copy" and plot history  
browsing as well). About the toolbar, it could be a pref setting to  
display it or not by default, and would probably encourage newcomers  
to use these nice features.

As you see, I care more about features than toolbar and not at all  
about the tools and tabs?
But I really think this zoom feature would really help user in data  
exploration, allowing to zoom in and out within plot.

I really would like my programming skills allow me to contribute to  
this R gui, unfortunately I'm not trained at cocoa. And it sounds like  
this is not the easiest stuff to start with? One day I'll have time  
to read and work hillegass' cocoa book I bought a long time ago ;)

Thank you again for your attention. Best,

Thomas

Dear R community,

I have three variables (time series) named x, y and z. I need to know
how "x" changes the impact of "y" on "z". Any suggestions?

I notice that there is now a new Cocoa version of Mac Tk (http://github.com/das/tcltk/tree/clang-de-carbon 
), which I understand will be released with Tcl/Tk 8.6.

Is this likely to resolve the issues with tcltk within R, so that X11  
is no longer necessary?

Hi Vladimir

Based on your output my guess is that you need to install the  
developer tools (compilers, make, etc.). These tools reside on your OS  
X system install DVDs, but are not installed automatically.

Your message came through a little garbled, but I have installed sowas
on my mac mini with no problems... Downloaded the tarball and compiled
it with R CMD install (I did have a couple of problems, but they are
in the archive and they were things like not typing in the right name
of the file).

the message says that the make command was not found.  Do you have
xcode tools installed?  I don't know if make ships with os x.

The following yields all strings with "oo" except when "b" is
present anywhere:

R> txt[setdiff(grep("oo", txt), grep("b", txt))]
[1] "goo" "foo"

I don't see "doo" in the example string vector "txt".  
Perhaps there is more to this that I didn't get?

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] nested cross-sectional design using lmer or nlme
Message-ID: <3F058580-5A3A-42F1-8007-B43342A04EBF@tcd.ie>

Dear all, I'd appreciate some advice on the following problem.  I'm  
attempting to analyse a nested cross-sectional design in which an  
intervention was offered to a series of randomly selected (small)  
communities, so the unit of randomisation is the community.  All  
available individuals in each community were interviewed before the  
intervention and again at follow-up post-intervention.  The set of  
available individuals at baseline and at follow-up were far from  
identical (a common feature of such designs).  Similarly, a series of  
control communities were interviewed.  This type of design is  used in  
epidemiological studies particularly in intervention designed to alter  
lifestyle factors.  Such designs tend to be highly unbalanced Murray  
et al. discuss the appropriate analysis of such studies (Analysis of  
data from group-randomized trials with repeat observations on the same  
groups, Stats in Med. 17, 1581-1600).  They offer three examples of   
SAS code - one of which is as follow:
proc mixed;
  class cond unit timecat;
   model y=cond timecat cond*timecat/ddfm=res;
   random int timecat/subject=unit(cond);
run;

cond is 0/1 corresponding to control/intervention
timecat is 0/1 corresponding to baseline/follow-up
unit is 1 to 39 and identifies the communities.
and y is a continuous score

I've read the random statement as cond nested within unit and crossed  
(?) by timecat.
Unfortunately I'm not familiar with SAS code.  I would expect random  
effects for unit and timecat X unit

I would much appreciate any suggestions on how to code the above? in  
lmer o rnlme.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Too many dependencies with BioConductor packages?
Message-ID: <4A40C7E0.4050202@csse.unimelb.edu.au>

Hi,

I've tried to use R.app Package Installer to install the BioConductor 
package GOstats, with "install dependencies" checked, but R proceeded to 
download many other packages before I killed it:

(this is the temporary downloaded_packages directory)
$ ls
AffymetrixDataTestFiles_0.1.1.tgz R.oo_1.4.8.tgz 
affxparser_1.16.0.tgz             makePlatformDesign_1.8.0.tgz
R.methodsS3_1.0.3.tgz             R.utils_1.1.7.tgz 
hapmap100kxba_1.3.2.tgz           pd.mapping50k.xba240_0.4.1.tgz

These aren't in the Depends of GOstats, 
http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GOstats.html, 
which lists:
Depends  Biobase , Category , graph

Without "install dependencies" checked, it installs fine.

I'm using 2.9.0 from CRAN, BioC 2.4.0, OS X 10.5.7.

Thanks,
Gad

If A depends on B then installing dependencies means that you also  
have to satisfy all dependencies of B which could be C, D, E, F then  
their dependencies and so on. The dependency tree in BioC can be quite  
big... So R was doing what you told it to do.

Cheers,
Simon

Does "install dependencies" only install Depends or also Suggests?

The downstream Depends for GOstats are pretty minimal and don't include 
any of the packages I listed:

GOstats: Biobase , Category , graph
Biobase: R , methods , utils
Category: AnnotationDbi , Biobase
graph: R , methods
AnnotationDbi: R , methods , utils , Biobase

It's equivalent to install.packages(dependencies=TRUE)

OK, so it installs all the Depends, Imports, Suggests, and Enhances.

Maybe this should be mentioned somehow in the GUI (rename "install 
dependencies"?). It's not too much of an issue for CRAN, but in 
BioConductor there are large packages (10s of MB at least) which can get 
downloaded needlessly but are only Suggested.

Thanks,
Gad

But does the non-checked Package Installer action mimic what the  
default "dependencies=NA" does?

"The default, NA, means c("Depends", "Imports") if lib is unambiguous,  
and FALSE otherwise."

(I think that means FALSE in my case, since I do not have an  
unambiguous .libPaths(), but for most people it appears to mean NA. )

As another user I vote "opposed" to that suggestion. I would want the  
Install dependencies check box to do what the naive-user like myself  
would expect, which is to mimic the action of install.packages(<pkg>,  
<url>, dependencies=TRUE).

As an alternative suggestion, it might be helpful to have the R  
command echoed to the GUI console so that a syntactically correct  
template could be modified.

No, in that case it's FALSE. The checkbox directly corresponds to the  
"dependencies" parameter - hence the name. (It precedes the time of  
"Enhanced" and friends so the life was simple back then ;)).

While this might not be "here" nor "there," it's certainly somewhere  
in between:

If you stick with the recommended way of installing bioconductor  
libraries, ie:

R> source('http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R')
R> biocLite('GOstats')

You'd likely circumvent this problem. GOstats is installed in my  
system, but most all of the extra packages you were pulling down are  
not.

You put it in your executable search path and I wrote 'input search 
path'.  That's not 'following'!

You've not told us what TeX you have installed (and none comes with 
Mac OS X and there is a choice of third-party ones).  So the following 
is a guess based on the fact that R's utiities work (and they do set 
the input search path).

You need to manipulate the environment variable TEXINPUTS.  Something 
like

export TEXINPUTS="/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/share/texmf:"

(You may well not just be able to append to TEXINPUTS as set, as it 
may or may not have a trailing colon.)

The reason for the caution is that there are TeX distributions in 
which this does not work, and other ways are needed to set the input 
search path -- and that used for R on Windows is one of them.

Thanks for your quick answer

In fact I wondered how TeX could use the PATH variable...

Yes it was not very clear. I use texlive 2008 coming from the latest  
MacTex "pack".

Thanks it works fine now, both the makefile and the R Sweave command.

Message-ID: <107486337375124364564849426469364594425-Webmail@me.com>

Hi All,

I am trying to compile R-devel on a new MacPro but I am having some difficulties compiling from source. 
The problem appears when I add the option --with-acqua, see the message error below. If I set --without-acqua, everything is fine.
I have searched the list for related issues but I could not find anything that would help me. There is an email from Vince Carey with a similar issue, but no fix is posted as far as I could tell.

Here is the end of the building process:

You have forgotten to set OBJC accordingly and thus you get the wrong  
architecture for Obj-C files (see the error message). For an example  
on how to build multiple archs (64-bit is just another architecture)  
see R for Mac FAQ 2.5.

Hi, I was just curious how quickly after the R 2.9.1 release we might see an updated Mac package?
Thanks,
Chris

It's on CRAN now; perhaps the mirror you're using is a little slow to 
update?

The pre-built Mac binaries for R 2.9.1 are already up on the CRAN  
mirror network.

Is there a particular mirror where you are not seeing it?

Thanks. Apparently the Berkeley mirror has been updated since I looked this morning.

Probably quite a bit slow:

2009-06-26 13:29 R-2.9.1.dmg

so the Mac binary was actually out very early this time ... you could  
install it while having your afternoon tea on the R release date :).

Cheers,
Simon

In the bottomless pit of my stupidity I always wanted to ask the  
following, but I've always been too ashamed (or lazy) to ask. I always  
download the full dmg, but I never install any of the supplementary  
packages. Should I? only in case of a fresh installation (I'm  
upgrading now)? I have Xcode and X11 installed already anyway.

I would use the full installer at least once :-)

It provides a tcl/tk library that R can use, as well as a gfortran  
compiler that can target the different Mac architectures (ppc/x86 32  
and 64 bit). While XCode will compile source package that only rely on  
C source, you'd be marooned w/o the gfortran compiler if a package has  
fortran source. That said, if you're just installing the binary  
package, then you probably wouldn't even notice.

I used the mini installer this time to upgrade from 2.9.0 to 2.9.1.

This has nothing to do with Xcode or  X11. The full packages contains  
Tcl/Tk and GNU Fortran. You'll need Tcl/Tk is you want to use tcltk  
(the one that OS X ships with doesn't work) and you'll need GNU  
Fortran if you want to compile packages from sources that contain  
Fortran code. So if you a) don't use tcltk and b) don' t compile  
packages from sources you're fine wit the mini version.

Cheers,
Simon

I see... I always download the full dmg and 'double-click to install'.  
I was confused by the availability of the separate packages.

Cheers,

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] "Extra" new line characters in history w/ R 2.9.1
Message-ID: <D7C53D32-0DFB-4708-9FF2-AAC7DCBB3894@cmmt.ubc.ca>

Hi All,


I recently upgraded to R 2.9.1 on my MacBook Pro running Mac OS X  
10.5.7.

Previously, at the command prompt in the GUI the up arrow key scrolled  
through the history.  This still works for me, but every time I scroll  
up the previous command gets an extra new line character appended to  
it.  I've attached a screen shot showing what happens when I  
repeatedly use a single stroke of the up arrow to recall the previous  
command.  This is trivial, but makes using the history rapidly more  
challenging because you have to delete though a bunch of whitespace  
when trying to edit previously used commands.

This changed immediately after I upgraded to 2.9.1.  Does anyone know  
if something in R/GUI changed, or if I just had a setting that I don't  
know about altered when I upgraded?


Thanks for your advice,


jeff

It seems that your preferences may have changed because the GUI didn't  
change in 2.9.1 - make sure you have "Cleanup history entries" enabled  
in Preferences->Startup->History.

Cheers,
Simon

Apparently I was incorrect ... http://cran.cnr.berkeley.edu/ is still 
showing 2.9.0 for Mac.

Not for me (Universal R 2.9.1 for Mac OS X released on 2009/06/26) ...  
make sure you don't have some proxy in the way which is caching  
pages ...

Christopher,

Try to do a refresh/reload of the page, as I show on:

   http://cran.cnr.berkeley.edu/bin/macosx/

that the 2.9.1 dmg file is there.

It might be a page caching issue in your browser.

HTH,

Marc
