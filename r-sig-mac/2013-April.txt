Try using valgrind, at a cursory glance this seems like some memory corruption...

However, what makes me really uneasy is that you have a lot of conflicting stuff coming from /opt/local -- in particular it seems as if CRAN R and /opt/local is being mixed up - chances are that you are mixing incompatible binaries. Either build everything (incl. R) the way you do in /opt/local or make sure you don't have duplicated incompatible parts in /ipt/local and the framework. 

Cheers,
Simon

Message-ID: <1C5AA8EF-5A70-4BAF-818C-ADC83C088E22@imperial.ac.uk>

Hi All,

is there an intelligent way of uninstalling the stuff that comes with gcc-4.2 (Apple build 5666.3) with GNU Fortran 4.2.4 for Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion) without accidentally removing something else?  I could use pkgutil to fish out all the files and remove them by hand (my bash foo is not foo enough to do it automagically and without ever deleting other stuff by mistake) but it is a bit of a faff.

The old standalone gfortran had a uninstall script that was pretty handy?

From Apple there is pkgutil --unlink for uninstallation, but I don't know if it was introduced in 10.7 or 10.8. There are other 3rd party tools that do the same thing (or more), but I have not used any of those myself.

It was pretty much just
pkgutil --files xxx.pkg | sed 's:^:rm -f /:' | sort -r
plus dir tweaks anyway, so it's really what you describe above.

Cheers,

pkgutil --unlink does not exist anymore since 10.7.  I guess it caused way too many catastrophic errors.

Thanks, I'll see what I can cook up.  Before I do something terminally stupid, does the package *overwrite* anything or are all the files listed by pkgutil --files org.r-project.gcc-42.darwin11.pkg safe to remove?

Yes, it only overwrites gcc-4.2 from old Xcode, but nothing from the system.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] maptools in R 3.0.0
Message-ID: <51601BBD.9060002@yahoo.fr>

I posted my question in R-help Mailing list but Brian Ripley answers 
that it was not the good place to ask for it.
Since R 3.0.0, compiled version of maptools package is no more available 
as a binary in cran. Brian Ripley answers me that I must build it from 
source... ok. But how. That is my question.
He gives me the trick that rgeos must be installed first:
I do it from http://r.research.att.com/libs/

Then how to build maptools package ? I am lost.

Thanks a lot.
Marc

You don't need to - the binary is on CRAN, just use
install.packages("maptools")

Marc,

I had the same problem with another library while trying to download it in the R-Package Installer of R for Mac OS X GUI.  I was installing the fields library which needed to also load a dependency library which would not load and was not in the 'Cran binary' list.  The library of course would not work without the dependency.  However when I looked in the lists available under Get List button the option 'Other Repository' had the needed library.  I loaded it and the fields function that needed the dependency library worked.  I am not sure this is a temporary fix or whether all dependencies that might automatically be loaded will be brought into the combined 'Cran binary' list.  I guess this might be a R OS X GUI issue?

It does not sound like the same problem unless you only mean that it  
also involves difficulties with installing a package.

R does not check for the existence of other R package dependencies (or  
for the existence of external libraries)  at the time of installing a  
binary package. If I understand you correctly that is what you did. It  
would not have anything to do with the Mac GUI. If you compile from  
source there is an effort to load the package after compilation.  
Missing dependencies would necessarily show up at that stage.  The GUI  
package installer does have a checkbox to "Install Dependencies" and I  
assume you would have gotten an informative error message had you used  
that checkbox.

I do not know if the `install.packages` command would allow you to  
specify multiple repositories in which to search if you had set  
dependencies=TRUE in the call. The help page says 'repos' needs to be  
a character vector, so maybe it would succeed.  I would not have  
expected the GUI installer to be able to do that in its current  
incarnation.

Hello!
I am new to Mac and I wonder is there a way to migrate all existing packages to the latest R 3.0? I did that for my colleague who uses MS Win, and that never was as issue in Linux. So, what are our options under Mac OS X?

Many thanks,
PM

My understanding is that you have to reinstall them from 0.  Having said that, because of dependencies this is often quite trivial if you install some 'high dependencies' packages first.

You can either use the GUI (in the Package Installer -> "Select Packages from R 2.15" -> Install) or the command line:

a=rownames(installed.packages("/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.15/Resources/library"))
install.packages(!(a %in% rownames(installed.packages())))

The latter works on any OS.

Simon

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Fonts not working in Quartz
Message-ID: <516470F0.8040200@gmail.com>

Hi-

When I use 'plot' the labels are all missing. If I set family='mono' (or 'sans' OR 'serif' then they 
appear). I can deal with this, even if it is a touch annoying.

However, when I use 'boxplot', I don't get labels with the default font or if I set family='mono' 
(or 'sans' OR 'serif').

> [1] "Helvetica" "Helvetica-Bold" "Helvetica-Oblique" "Helvetica-BoldOblique"

> [1] "Courier" "Courier-Bold" "Courier-Oblique" "Courier-BoldOblique"

The help indicates that Helvetica is the default font for Quartz - obviously this is not correct - I 
suspect it is Arial (which has caused me problems before).

I did look through the last two of years of the R-SIG-Mac archive but didn't find anything that 
helped. Is there something else I can check?

In particular, I would be grateful if someone could provide me information on the following:
1) What might be wrong with Boxplot?
2) How do I figure out what the default Quartz font is?
3) Any advice on fixing this font, if that is the problem? I've tried deleting duplicates in 'Font 
Book' to no avail ...

Thanks so much!
-Randall

Please see R for Mac FAQ  10.14 "I see no text in a Quartz plot!":

"Typically this means that you have corrupted fonts in your system. Open the Font Book application (in Applications) and check the fonts that you are using (for example the default font in Quartz is ?Helvetica?). Corrupted fonts will have no glyphs (text will not appear as it should), remove such fonts."

For anyone who is interested, I eventually solved the problem I was having by:

1) clearing the font cache ("sudo atsutil databases -remove" in the Terminal followed by restarting)
	which led to R generating error messages indicating that it couldn't find Arial
		(apparently, Arial (not Helvetica) is the default font for Quartz)

2) using Font Book to add the useful version of Arial back to the fonts library
	I had confirmed that I was using a functional Arial,
	    however Font Book's 'Resolve Duplicates' command had removed
	    the newer version of Arial and kept an old one that R couldn't understand

NB: for anyone trying to fix a similar problem, remember to close the Quartz window before 
replotting or your changes in the 'Font Book' won't have taken effect ;-)

Possibly

install.packages(a[!(a %in% rownames(installed.packages()))])

works better

Greetings-

I've noticed that lme4 isn't available for Mac under R 3.

Looks like its throwing errors at compile time, according to the logs. 
I'm tempted to just pull it down and build it myself, but thought I'd let the list / Simon know too.

More precisely, if fails checks:

that's why it's not available. I tried two different compilers just to make sure it's not a compiler issue and it throws the same error, so I fear this is over to the maintainers.

Ah hah!
OK- that's good to know (sorry for na?vet?, just learning how to build things in the R-ecosphere).

Realize this isn't r-mac specific, but, is there a way to run package tests post 

install.packages("lme4", type = 'source')

sorts of procedures? I tried things like lme4.test() et alia...

See ?tools::testInstalledPackage.  You can do better tests on a tarball 
because some test material is not installed by default.

And you can find things like this from the R command prompt by ??tests, 
or using the sos package and ???tests.

[Previous version was not plain text. Sorry, plain text this time?]

On a related note to the lme4 query? There was a glorious period of time where rgdal binaries (with it's external dependancies) were available on CRAN for the mac. Unfortunately, with the introduction of R 3.0 this is no longer the case. It now requires a rather protracted install process (installing GDAL, then PROJ4, then installing rgdal from source using the proper configuration arguments). I understand that this is a known issue https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-geo/2013-April/017989.html, and was wondering whether CRAN is planning on supporting a binary distribution in the future. If not, is CRAN Extras planning on hosting it?

I'm currently in the process of updating the OpenStreetMap package, and was planning on moving rgdal from a suggest to a depends, but would like to know the lay of the land before proceeding.

Best,
Ian

Message-ID: <CAF42j21p0ZHggmvqZT_Mg+V-XenU4p6ZmJP0bmbwW8W6pZGzUg@mail.gmail.com>

Not sure if this is a bug or not, but there is different behavior
between R.app and command-line R as regards
DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH.

If I start R.app and try and load the BioC package 'impute':

source('http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite("impute")
library(impute)

I get:

Error in dyn.load(file, DLLpath = DLLpath, ...) :
  unable to load shared object
'/Library/Frameworks/R.framework.release/Versions/3.0/Resources/library/impute/libs/impute.so':
  dlopen(/Library/Frameworks/R.framework.release/Versions/3.0/Resources/library/impute/libs/impute.so,
6): Library not loaded: /usr/local/lib/libgfortran.2.dylib
  Referenced from:
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework.release/Versions/3.0/Resources/library/impute/libs/impute.so
  Reason: image not found
Error: package or namespace load failed for 'impute'

However, the package loads fine in command-line R.

I found that if I start R.app like this:

 export DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH=/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/lib
open /Applications/R.app

Then I can load the impute package.

So can R.app set this variable when it starts? Or is there another
solution I need to look at?

Thanks,
Dan

It turns out that BioC was making packages incorrectly.

You can disregard this message.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Missing packages
Message-ID: <F4210B8B-1505-4337-990B-86ECDC1A1BBB@gmail.com>


Hello!
I wonder why some very basic packages are missing in R 3.0. My list of missing is:
c(?BiocGenerics?, ?Rgraphviz?, ?base?, ?compiler?, ?dataframe?, ?datasets?, ?grDevices?, ?graph?, ?graphics?, ?grid?, ?methods?, ?parallel?, ?splines?, ?stats?, ?stats4?, ?tcltk?, ?tools?)

Some I am not using. Some, like base is reborn as base 64. Some might be from Bioconductor, I suppose. Most of those I needed long time ago, or they came as dependencies. However, things like methods, parallel etc., seems important.

Will those come eventually? How to bypass?

Best,
PM

Why do you claim that these are 'missing'?

Most are part of R: fire up R and do row.names(installed.packages(.Library))
And see the posting guide: there is no 'R 3.0', never has been and never 
will be.

BiocGenerics Rgraphviz and graph are from BioC.

datafame has been archived -- see 
http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dataframe/index.html.  It does 
not work with R >= 3.0.0.

I can't get R 3.0.0 to run from the command line on my Macs.  I get the following error.

  $ R --version

It works fine within RStudio or with the R GUI.

Any suggestions of what's going wrong?

Yes, you have R startup script from an old version of R. Remove /usr/bin/R and re-install R.

rgdal fails the checks, it segfaults:

Here is the output of valgrind:

.. followed by a crash. Possibly some incompatibility between jpeg and gdal? I may have a look later unless the maintainers have some insight...

Ah; I had "export R_ARCH=/x86_64" in my .bashrc file; I removed that and now it runs fine.

thanks, Simon, for your help!

It seems that gdal gets confused with internal and external libraries in a static build - likely causing API mismatch which demonstrated itself in the crash. After re-building gdal with minimal dependencies it seems to work. The rgdal binary is up.

Cheers,
Simon

This is what the Apple gcc branch reports, because that's what the gcc driver is build from (Apple's gcc 4.2.1 build 5666.3), but the Fortran sources that have been added into that branch are from GNU Fortran 4.2.4 (see the page that you downloaded it from - it has the details).

Hi,

I went to upgrade a working R 3.0.0 to the patched version and I'm  
finding that
I can't open it.  I went back and downloaded the unpatched version and
find the same problem.  I can open R in the terminal, so sounds like
a problem with R.app.

I'm on a Mac Air running OS 10.7.5.  From the terminal:

That log says

   Library not loaded: 
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.1/Resources/lib/libR.dylib

'3.1' means R-devel, not 3.0.0 and not R-patched.

I can confirm this from today's R-patched: it looks like the wrong 
version of R.app got bundled:

tystie% otool -L /Applications/R.app/Contents/MacOS/R
/Applications/R.app/Contents/MacOS/R:
	/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.1/Resources/lib/libR.dylib 
(compatibility version 3.1.0, current version 3.1.0)


However, reverting to 3.0.0 should work.  One issue (and did we not see 
a report from you about it?) is that the installer does not necessarily 
replace the copy of R.app in /Applications if it finds another one. 
(That has happened to me when the one I last used was a personal build.) 
  So I would remove all copies of R.app from your system and re-install 
3.0.0.

Your suggestion of removing R.app and reinstalling 3.0.0 worked.
Thank you, very much.

I would have tried to install R.app directly from http://r.research.att.com
but the only versions listed are 2.15.x and 3.1.x.

best,

Ken

Dear Simon,

On your developer site you mention:
"We use Xcode 4.2 but Xcode 3.2 and higher should work as well. Note 
that you will need Command Line Tools component of Xcode on Mac OS X 
10.7 or higher."

I am running OS X 10.7.5 and XCode 4.2.1 on my Mac, but have not 
downloaded the command line tools. My questions are:

- why do I need the command line tools?

- which version do I need to download from:
https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action

There are e.g.
   - Command Line Tools (OS X Lion) for Xcode - October 2012
     (it is not mentioned which version of Xcode)
   - Command Line Tools (OS X Lion) for Xcode - November 2012
     (Xcode 4.3 is mentioned but it is nor clear if it works with 4.2.1)
   - Command Line Tools (OS X Lion) for Xcode - April 2013
     (Xcode 4.6.2 is mentioned but it is nor clear if it works with 4.2.1)

   (BTW, the Preferences for Xcode 4.2.1 do not list Command Line Tools 
in the Install window.)

- do the Command Line Tools update clang/clang++?

The reason for my question is that in order to compile the C++ code in 
my package with clang I need at least version 3.1 since 3.0 results in 
an error.

Best regards,
Christian

Hi:

The command line tools can be installed once you have Xcode by stating Xcode, going to "Preference" in the File menu and then there is a "Download" option.  That is where you can install the CLI.

You may have to give a terminal command the first time to point to it once installed - I would shave to look that up - I know this had to be done for Fink.

HTH,

-Roy M.

Because Xcode no longer installs compilers, linkers etc. in the system, so you won't be able to run them.

It doesn't really matter (it may matter in the future, because Apple has announced that they'll be removing llvm-gcc from Xcode) - latest should be fine for now. The version is independent of your Xcode -- in fact if you download it by hand, you don't even need Xcode at all.

I'm not sure what you mean by "Install window", but as Roy said, you'll find it in the download section of the preferences.

Yes

You'll need to tweak your local ~/.R/Makevars for that to work since CRAN's R uses llvm-gcc.

It seems that my version of Xcode 4.2.1 does have all compilers 
installed, including clang, but version 3.0:
$ clang -v
Apple clang version 3.0 (tags/Apple/clang-211.12) (based on LLVM 3.0svn)
Target: x86_64-apple-darwin11.4.2

When I open the Preferences and go to the download section I see a 
checkbox "Check for and install updates automatically", and below the 
list of items, which are:
- iOS 4.3 Simulator (499.2 MB)
- iOS 4.0 - 4.1 Device Debugging Support (505.1 MB)
- iOS 3.0 - 3.2.2 Device Debugging Support (686.3 MB)
None of these three items do I want to install since the download would 
be 1.7 GB and my internet connection is not very fast.

This seems not to be possible since then I cannot compile my C++ code at 
all. It seems to interfere with the ROOT framework compiled with clang 
and does not find an include file. My Makefile depends on the ROOT 
config file.

My apologies, I didn't notice carefully that you were using Xcode 4.2.1.  But Google is your friend,  Apple has changed the name of what you need to download, see:

Dear Roy,

Thank you for this info. It seems that only the versions of Xcode which 
you download from the AppStore need the Command Line Tools installed.
Nevertheless, in order to install a new version of clang I need to 
install the CLTs.

Best regards,
Christian

In our experience all versions since 4.5 do, wherever you install them 
from.   People who use long-outdated versions of tools cannot expect the 
current instructions to apply to them. And the R manual does make that 
clear:

?Command Line Tools for Xcode? used to be part of the Apple Developer 
Tools (?Xcode?) but nowadays need to be installed separately. They can 
be downloaded from http://developer.apple.com/devcenter/mac/ (you will 
need to register there) or if you have a recent Xcode installed (from 
the App Store or from https://developer.apple.com/devcenter/mac/) you 
can install the command-line tools from within Xcode, from the 
?Downloads? pane in the ?Preferences?.

Note 'used', 'nowadays', 'recent'.

And isn't it nice of Apple to allow you to download them separately?

No, it's rather your Xcode is so old that it had CLI embedded, new ones don't.

Dear Prof. Ripley, dear Simon,

Thank you for this information about Xcode and CLTs.

Since I have heard that R and Bioconductor packages should in the future 
be built with clang since Apple will be discontinuing support of gcc, my 
question is:

- Which version of Xcode and/or CLTs should Snow Leopard users install 
in the future? (the last official version for Snow Leopard is xcode_3.2.6)

- Which version of Xcode and/or CLTs should Lion/Mountain Lion users 
install so that they can still compile their packages with gcc, too?
(the current version is xcode_4.6.2)

 From the discussion I understand that it is no longer necessary to 
install Xcode at all, installing CLTs is sufficient. Is this  correct?

Best regards,
Christian

I've not heard that, and you give no reference.  It's a pretty safe 
prediction except for timing: it could be a year away.  So your 
questions are not relevant until it is announced.  The documentation in 
the current R manuals is currently the correct advice.

Apple have announced the imminent discontinuation of llvm-gcc, and we 
take that to mean it will not be in Xcode 4.7 (or 5.0 if that is 
released first).  That would mean that once that is released, for most 
users of Lion and later llvm-gcc will disappear (as most users will get 
an automatic upgrade from the AppStore, or as in my case, the sysadmins 
will push out an update).

So we have been working hard on making R and CRAN packages installable 
using clang (there were too many problems at decision time for 3.0.0). 
How to switch a CRAN binary installation to use clang[++] is in the R >= 
3.0.0 manuals.  That may not work for packages with configure scripts: 
for that you may need R-patched.

There are now only seven CRAN packages which have bugs which stop 
installation under clang, and all the maintainers have been sent 
patches.  (Two of those do not install under gcc 4.8.0 either.)

Very likely at some point Simon will switch the CRAN binary distribution 
to use clang, but the real point is that many end-users will need to do 
so soon.

Given that R 3.0.0 supports OS 10.6 (Snow Leopard), it is likely that we 
will do so for all of the 3.0.x series, even though 10.6 will almost 
certainly reach end-of-life well before 3.1.0 is due.  In that case the 
CRAN builder could stick with llvm-gcc for that series, but it may prove 
more convenient for end-users to switch to the distribution to clang 
before then.  Only time will tell.

I had fixed it the same day (one of the build scripts was inadvertently trying to do too many things at once), but the post got stuck in my mailer.


> However, reverting to 3.0.0 should work.  One issue (and did we not see a report from you about it?) is that the installer does not necessarily replace the copy of R.app in /Applications if it finds another one. (That has happened to me when the one I last used was a personal build.)  So I would remove all copies of R.app from your system and re-install 3.0.0.

I have now marked R.app as not relocatable which *should* make the Installer less zealous in finding the wrong R.app binary. This means that once you move R.app it won't be upgraded, but you can at least rely on the fact that /Applications/R.app will be the location of the R.app after you installed it.

Thanks,
Simon

Dear Prof. Ripley,

Thank you for this extensive information.

You mention that you have been working hard on making R and CRAN 
packages installable using clang, which is quite an effort.

Currently, the Bioconductor maintainers are doing the same, i.e. 
checking which BioC packages are installable using clang, and I was 
informed that my package 'xps' cannot be installed using clang.

In my case the main problem seems to be that the version of clang used 
has a bug which prevents compilation of xps (and the necessary ROOT C++ 
framework).

Concretely, both the Bioconductor server running Snow Leopard and my 
Snow Leopard Mac have versions of Xcode, which include clang Version 
3.0. In order to compile ROOT successfully, at least clang Version 3.1 
is necessary, see:
http://root.cern.ch/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=14614#p62969

On my Mac running Lion (10.7.5) I have currently also installed Xcode 
4.2.1 which contains clang Version 3.0, so I could reproduce this error 
also on Lion. After downloading the the 'Command Line Tools (OS X Lion) 
for Xcode - March 2013' from the Apple developer site the version of 
clang is now:
$ clang -v
Apple LLVM version 4.2 (clang-425.0.27) (based on LLVM 3.2svn)
Target: x86_64-apple-darwin11.4.2

Using this version I could successfully compile both ROOT and xps. The 
problem is that I do not know how to obtain a more recent version of 
clang for Snow Leopard, the system currently running on the BioC server.

I would very much appreciate if you could propose a solution for this 
problem.

Thank you in advance.
Best regards,
Christian

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] External header files not found
Message-ID: <5171A234.1080106@aon.at>

Dear All,

Currently I am testing whether my package xps can be compiled on the Mac 
with clang, and indeed everything is fine.

However, when I create ~/.R/Makevars to set CC and CXX as described in:
http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-patched/R-admin.html#OS-X-packages
then the header files of the external framework that I use are no longer 
found.

Since my package depends on the external C++ framework, I had to create 
my own 'configure.in' and 'Makefile' which checks e.g. for the presence 
of the variable ROOTSYS containing the path to the framework.

Trying to follow the example:
http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-patched/R-exts.html#Configure-example
I added following lines to my configure.in file:

: ${R_HOME=`R RHOME`}
if test -z "${R_HOME}"; then
    echo "could not determine R_HOME"
    exit 1
fi
CC=`"${R_HOME}/bin/R" CMD config CC`
CFLAGS=`"${R_HOME}/bin/R" CMD config CFLAGS`
CPPFLAGS=`"${R_HOME}/bin/R" CMD config CPPFLAGS`
AC_LANG(C++)
AC_PROG_CPP
AC_PROG_CC

ROOT_CPPFLAGS="-I. -I${ROOTSYS}/include"
CPPFLAGS="${CPPFLAGS} ${ROOT_CPPFLAGS}"

However, this did not help, the header files are still not found.

Can someone tell me what I need to do so that the external header files 
are found, or does ~/.R/Makevars overwrite everything?

Best regards,
Christian

Dear Kasper,

Thank you for this suggestion, although I must admit that I do not quite 
understand how to use PKG_CPPFLAGS (eve after looking at 'Writing R 
Extensions').
Nevertheless, I found an earlier reply from you at:
https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/2007-March/045016.html
which did help me. I needed to modify my Makefile and not my config 
file. Now everything works.

Best regards,
Christian

Martin,

It looks like you need to change one line slightly:

filenames<-all.filenames[!(all.filenames %in% old.filenames$V1)]

...because you're reading old.filenames.tab into a data frame. I don't
think this should be platform-dependent, but don't know for sure.

Another option, simpler it seems to me, would be to move the files to
a "already_processed" folder when you're done with them.

Ben

Dear list, 

The build page at

http://r.research.att.com/building.html

explicitly mentions

<quote>
Note that your binary will require you to install all packages from sources. 
</quote>

Is there any documentation on how to compile R from source
in such a way that one can install binary packages from CRAN? 

I have read

http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-admin.html#OS-X

but may have overlooked any specific pointers.

Many thanks in advance for your help.

Best,
Tobias

P.S. target R version currently is R 2.15.3 but if R 3.0.0 
would make this easier, then that is a sufficient reason to
move to R 3.0.0.

Why do you want to do that?  If you modify the sources binary packages 
may not longer work ....

No guarantees, but

- do this for the version of R you currently have installed.

- configure R with --with-aqua, --enable-R-framework (which are the 
default, AFAIR).

- install it to the framework.

Then the version you built should be the one used by 'R' and 'R.app': 
try it at the command-line.

The default option("pkgType") will be "source", but you will be able to 
use options(pkgType="mac.binary") (3.0.0) or "mac.binary.leopard" 
(2.15.3).  To set the default during compilation, define 
PLATFORM_PKGTYPE when building src/main/platform.c

The actual flags used to build the current CRAN binary are in

https://svn.r-project.org/R-dev-web/trunk/QA/Simon/R-build/conf.snowleopard-x86_64

If you want to replicate the CRAN build (requires Mac OS X 10.6), you can set it up with:

mkdir /Builds
cd /Builds
svn co https://svn.r-project.org/R-dev-web/trunk/QA/Simon/R-build nightly
make

cd /Builds/nightly
## put your favorite R sources here - either using svn or unpacking a tar ball - let's say it's R-3.0.0
./release R-3.0.0

If all went well you'll have everything built, installed, packages and tar balls in
deploy/snowleopard/R-3.0.0

In order to match the R capabilities that we supply on CRAN you'll also need quite a few static libraries like fontconfig, freetype, cairo etc.

Cheers,
Simon

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] How to move existing packages?

For me !(a %in% rownames(installed.packages())) gives a vector of {TRUE,
FALSE}; so, Simon's second approach didn't work. But the following
(mostly) works:

a <- 
rownames(installed.packages("/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.15/
Resources/library"))
to.install <- setdiff(a, rownames(installed.packages()))
install.packages(to.install)


This didn't work for lme4. So, after installing gfortran-4.2.3.pkg from
<http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools/gfortran-4.2.3.pkg> (I already
had all the other needed tools under R 2.15, I guess), I ran the following:

to.install <- setdiff(a, rownames(installed.packages())) # Now just "lme4"
install.packages(to.install, type="source")
