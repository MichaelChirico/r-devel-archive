Message-ID: <73DD731C-0D75-40FE-AA3C-507E01DA17E4@unimelb.edu.au>

I still have the problem I outlined earlier.  I am trying to run R  
2.3.1 on OS X 10.4.7 in order to use a package called affylmGUI.  I  
have to start X11 in in order to initialise the tcltk package, but  
when I start the affylmGUI, the extensions BWidget and Tktable aren't  
found.  I have installed them several times using the  
TclTkAquaBI-8.4.10.0, but it won't work.  I know that there are some  
problems with X11 and Aqua, but how can I get around that.  Even when  
I run R from the X11 terminal, it won't find the extensions (same  
error message)

What should I do?

That cannot work, because you're installing the wrong Tcl/Tk. You  
have to install the extensions for the X11 Tcl/Tk (which lives in / 
usr/local), but you are installing Aqua Tcl/Tk which is entirely  
different (and CRAN version of R doesn't use it).

Get the extensions for X11 Tcl/Tk. I don't know if they are available  
in binary form somewhere, if not, you may have to compile them from  
sources.

Alternatively, you can re-compile R with Aqua Tcl/Tk support, but  
then you cannot use the R GUI.

These infos I prepared on July 05 for some Bioc users worked at that  
time, of course you should take the latest versions of the packages.
But the idea is that one package should be built from source and the  
other one just moved in the appropriate folder of your system.

download BWidget from
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=12883
once you get the archive BWidget-1.7.0.tar.gz move it to /usr/local/ 
lib and install it with

sudo mv /some_download_path/BWidget-1.7.0.tar.gz /usr/local/lib
cd /usr/loca/lib
sudo tar zxf BWidget-1.7.0.tar.gz

and you are done.

download Tktable from
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=11464
and get Tktable2.9.tar.gz

now you need Apple Dev tools installed to continue:
tar zxf Tktable2.9.tar.gz
cd Tktable2.9
./configure
make
sudo make install

now it works in R

If you don't have dev tools installed I can send you a copy of  
Tktable built (80k).

In case you hadn't noticed, the 10.4.8 update "Adds support on Intel-

Accelerate framework; the maximum number of threads used by  
Accelerate BLAS routines is now limited by the environment variable

illegal instruction." (http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html? 
artnum=304200)

I would like to try it out but currently I have gcc 4.2 installed.  
Can I build R with gcc 4.2 and link it against the Accelerate  
framework or do I still need to build with gcc 4.0?

R-devel compiles with both gcc 4.0 and gcc 4.2 (and after some minor
tweaking with icc) under 10.4.8 and 10.5.0 on Mac Pro, using vecLib.

You may get into trouble with some packages if your compiler does
not support the arch flag, and you must be careful which gfortran
you use. But those problems may be specific to my system, because
I have too many versions of gcc and R installed.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Strange OS X editor window behavior
Message-ID: <BAY115-DAV134F47D86C6ED1A0494CCDB51C0@phx.gbl>

Hi all,
	I'm running R 2.3.1 (2006-06-01) with the R Aqua GUI 1.16 (3198)  
written by Simon and Stefano.  The OS/hardware is a dual 2 GHz  
PowerPC G5 PowerMac with 4 GB RAM and version 10.4.8 of Mac OS X.
	I'm finding a very strange behavior with the internal Aqua editor  
window.  After using R for a few minutes, the responsiveness of the  
editor window slows to a crawl whenever I type either the single (')  
or double (") quote characters.  Upon typing one of these characters,  
I get a "spinning beach ball" that forces me to wait to input the  
next characters.
	Oddly, latency remains fine when typing all other characters.  If I  
use an external editor such as TextWrangler, I don't experience this  
problem.  Also, the problem affects only the editor window;  
calculations in the console window proceed normally.  The only  
packages I have loaded are Hmisc, Design, and RODBC.
	Has anyone else experienced this behavior, or know what's going on?   
I couldn't find any information on this problem on the R site, so I'd  
appreciate feedback.

Thanks,
Kyle

You don't even need to. Starting with 2.4.0 ist's very simple (thanks  
to Brian) - make sure you use --enable-BLAS-shlib (it's the default  
unless you fiddle with other BLAS flags) then just symlink  
libRblas.dylib to the vecLib library. You can switch between all the  
libraries (ALTAS, vecLib, Rblas) by simply changing the symlink -  
that's all - happy testing :).

Cheers,
Simon

Yes, when you open a quote (' or ") the editor does syntax  
highlighting for the entire file, so if you open a quote in the  
beginning of a long file, it will take forever to change the color of  
the entire file. Given that your machine is fast, you must be dealing  
really with gigantic files to notice that slowdown, though ...  
Nevertheless, a fix is on the way.

Cheers,
Simon

Simon,
	Thanks for the quick response!  I'm a big fan of R on the Mac, and I  
really appreciate all your efforts on our behalf.  Regarding the  
syntax highlighting issue, I checked the R code with which I'm having  
a problem.  It's 841 lines and 4422 words.  Is that large enough to  
cause the problem?

Thanks,
Kyle

^^^ -- it seems to choke on altiVec commands, so my guess would be  
that you have to explicitly enable altiVec support for your compiler  
- try adding -faltivec to the compiler flags.

Oops.  I guess I was using the keystroke combination for sourcing  
files instead of loading them.

Hi there,

The error imply Tcl/Tk.

It is likely a problem with the mirror (the above URLs don't work  
me). Please try another mirror (e.g. http://cran.us.r-project.org  
works for me).

In the built-in edtor, if I try to recall previous commands for
editing, using the up arrow key, the edtor creates blank lines below
the previous command, so the cursor position moves up in the editing
window. For just one line editing, it is only a minor annoyance, but
when you try to edit and execute several previous commands, the space
at the bottom builds up until it may consume most of your editing
window, with the cursor ending up near the top. Would any settings
cure that?

I'm somehow lost. Can you, please, describe exactly what you do?  
First, do you mean the console (i.e. editing on the R prompt) or the  
editor (editing R code in a separate window)? I'm not quite sure how  
to recall previous commands in the editor... (arrows just move the  
cursor, right?). In the console I don't see any lines adding up,  
either. I'm sure I'm missing something, but I'm can't seem to find  
out what...

Thanks,
Simon

I meant the console, using the up arrow to call the line editor to
edit previous commands.  To reproduce the behavior, try
1. Use up arrow to recall a previous command
2. Do edit this command (otherwise it's fine)
3. Now use the up arrow again. (An extra blank line is created)
4. Edit a previous command again.
5. Now use the up arrow again. (You should see two extra blank lines)

I'm sorry but I can't reproduce this. When I'm editing a previous  
command and press <up>, no line is added and the just edited change  
is discarded (to be precise pressing <up> in the middle of a command  
moves your cursor up such that you can copy/paste in the history text  
- if you want the previous command, you have to go to the beginning  
or end of the line - but neither has anything to do with adding lines).

This is R  2.4.0 GUI 1.17 (3868), Mac OS X 10.4.7 ppc. What system  
and R are you running?

Cheers,
Simon

I typed a = rnorm(20); then used up arrow and edited the command a few
times. At each step an extra line is generated in the console.

R 2.4.0 GUI 1.17 (3868), OS X 10.4.8 intel, but I always noticed this,
even in a previous installation in a ppc.

Which is as expected. Can you send me your preferences file, please  
(it's in ~/Library/Preferences/org.R-project.R.plist)? Also please  
send me output of
Sys.getlocale()
and what keyboard setting you use as this seems to be specific to  
your system.

Thanks,

Thanks - I think the problem is that you disabled "cleanup history  
entries" in the preferences (Startup pane). It is on by default so  
the default behavior is correct. You should enable it unless you have  
a strong reason not to.

To make it work for R24-branch-tiger-universal.tar.gz, the '-' after

Hi,

When you ask for help on a topic that does not exist, a popup box
tells you "Help topic not found" and when you click OK, the focus goes
nowhere.

It would be much better, IMO, if after clicking OK, the focus went
back to the R command promt window.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Problems with R.mpkg and Tcl/Tk
Message-ID: <4528BD56.000005.16761@tide.yandex.ru>

Dear R-Mac Community,

Since official R now exists only for Tiger, I upgraded my Panther 10.3.9 to 10.4.3, then to 10.4.8. After that, I had several troubles regarding installation of R. First of all, R.mpkg neither from R.2.3.1.dmg, nor from R-2.4.0.dmg, nor from R-2.4.0-mini.dmg open in installer. Console had the message "Can't open package /Volumes/R-2.4.0-mini/R.mpkg (there was an error reading the file R.info)." Yes, this file (R.info) is absent in R.mpkg/Contents/Resources/English.lproj. Unfortunately, my efforts to create such a file manually were useless. 

Then I have started the installation of separate packages from /Packages folder of disk image, despite the warning (-- Please use R installer in the root of this image! --), because I had no other choice except compiling from source. The installation of R framework went well, but R-GUI.pkg refused to install with a message "You cannot install this software on this volume. Requires R framework version 2.4.x" -- but R framework 2.4.0 was already installed and worked from console! 

gcc403.pkg and tcltk.pkg installed OK. To have the R GUI, I downloaded "nightly build", and this is filally works. 

So, my first question, how to avoid this troubles in future?

The second question concerns Tcl/Tk and R Commander. I am the Russian translator of this package (and also of R itself), so I am interesting how to avoid the really ugly-looking Russian fonts in Tcl/Tk? (See the attachment for an example).

And also, when I forget to load X11 before calling R Commander, the first time tcl/tk interface finishes with error, which is OK. But if I load X11, and call R Commander the second time, R hangs forever (and no message on console). If I run X11 first, R Commander works relatively well. 

My computer is: 
Machine Name:iMac  
Machine Model: PowerMac4,5  
CPU Type: PowerPC G4 (2.1)  
Number Of CPUs:	1  
CPU Speed: 800 MHz

I am sorry for long message. Any help will be appreciated.

With best wishes,

This seems like a broken upgrade of your system or damaged image.  
Possibly you're fetching the outdated installer from the previous  
system. I have seen a similar problem on a broken system (it wouldn't  
open any installer files) long time ago. In that instance the OS was  
defective and had to be re-installed. I don't know if that is your  
case (I hope not), but the images work perfectly well on all systems  
I tested. You may want to check the MD5 sum to make sure the image is  
ok. There is no such thing as "R.info" in any of the packages.

Again, this looks as if your installer is broken. The package  
instructs the installer to look for
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.4/Resources/lib/libR.dylib
You may want to check manually - if it is there, then it's definitely  
the installer.

Get a working system ;)? No, seriously, I cannot reproduce any of the  
problems you illustrated. If you can reproduce the problems on  
another system, please let me know.

This will be an X11 and/or Tcl/Tk font issue. You can try your luck  
on R-help, consult any leads concerning cyrillic fonts in X11 on the  
web and/or ask the maintainer Rcmdr about font handling. The issue  
should not be Mac-specific, as X11 is used on all unix variants.

Same as above, you may want to ask the Rcmdr maintainer.

You must re-install them, but it's reasonably easy (after you  
installed R 2.4.0): Open the R.app GUI, go to menu "Packages & Data" - 
 > "Package Installer". Now click on "Get List", wait till you get  
the list. Click on the magnifying glass in the "Package Search" field  
and select "Select packages from R 2.2". Finally, press "Install  
Selected". If you use Bioconductor, you may want to repeat the same  
procedure but first selecting "BioConductor (binaries)" repository on  
top.

Message-ID: <0BE438149FF2254DB4199E2682C8DFEB01D555DE@crcmail1.BCCRC.CA>


Apple Mac OS X 10.4.8
R.app Version 2.4.0 GUI 1.17 (3868)


If I invoke a help window containing a URL to a PDF,
and I click on the hyperlink to the PDF, I get a
"Choose application" dialog window.  After dismissing
the window, the R help window disappears and I see
the following error output in the R.app GUI command line
window (see below).  

Anyone else noticing this behaviour?

Reproduce:
Start R.app
Enter help command
  > help("Methods", package = "methods")

Click on the PDF hyperlink at the bottom of the help page

  http://developer.r-project.org/howMethodsWork.pdf


(The hyperlink does work when I copy and paste it to a
 browser.)

If I then reinvoke help
  > help("Methods", package = "methods")
and click on the hyperlink, the help window goes
blank but no "Choose Application" dialog appears,
no error message in the console.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac]  R.app Help window problem with mouse click on PDF
Message-ID: <C15539DC.1C81%Beyerj@students.uni-marburg.de>

Steven, 

I can confirm this problem for
  Mac OS X 10.4.6
  R 2.2.1 
  Adobe Reader 7.0.8

(I searched the help files and found some valid pdf-links to test -- the one
you mentioned is not part of R 2.2.1.)

It would be interesting to see if this behavior is related to a specific
Adobe Reader version. Anyone?

Cheers, 
Joerg

Hi Steven & Joerg,

Just was able to reproduce the behavior.

I'll have a look.

Regards,
Rob

This happens to me all the time, too. I don't remember when it  
started, but it was definitely the case for v 2.3 and the many  
versions of the gui that accompanied it.

I can confirm that it's not AR version-specific behavior;
no longer have AR-6.0.x installed so someone else will have
to check that if necessary. It also makes no difference
whether the acroread application was running prior to the
invocation from within R.

I can only add that it works as advertised (i.e. the pdf is displayed  
inside the window) *without* AR. Please note that AR does screw up  
the OS a lot and it is quite tedious to restore it (if possible at  
all). I'm not quite willing to mess up my system with AR as I intend  
to work on that machine, so if anyone can shed some light as of what  
exactly AR breaks there, it would be nice. My guess would be that  
removing the AR plugin should restore the correct behavior  
(untested). Note that Adobe's un-installer doesn't uninstall the  
plugin and effectively breaks PDF bindings.

Cheers,
Simon

Hi Simon,


Thanks for the diagnosis.  It certainly
is not worth a bunch of work to integrate 
Adobe Reader into the mix.

I have a plug-in for Firefox (Manfred Schubert's 
PDF plugin) that loads PDFs, so I don't have to 
deal with AR there.  Can something similar be done for
the R help browser?  Is there some setting 
I can tweak to stop the R browser from 
invoking AR, or stop the OS from invoking AR
for R's browser?  (Not sure how all this works under
the hood.)


Cheers

Steve

Simon, Steven, and all,

I agree with you, Simon -- Adobe Reader is a source of constant problems and
annoyances; if I could do without it, I would. (macfixit.com reports a lot
on this. <add your preferred rant about Adobe here...>)


Ad 1: Workaround 

Simon, your guess was correct. Disabling the file "AdobePDFViewer.plugin" in
"/Library/Internet Plug-Ins/" removes the issue, but a restart may be
necessary. 
(I simply created a folder "Internet Plug-Ins (disabled)" in "Library" and
moved the PDFViewer.plugin to that folder)


Ad 2: Some additional remarks

I have to admit that cryptic error logs don't say that much to me, but I
thought that playing around a bit couldn't hurt.

(1) When I restarted my Mac this afternoon, I found some "Recovered files"
in my trash, all related to AR
-- "SendMail" [folder, empty],
-- "AdobeTempForLS.pdf" [pdf-file, size 0kB]
This is reproducible and directly related to the R.app vs. AR issue.

(2) Just in case it's relevant: After you have clicked on a pdf-link in the
help window, R.app *first* spits out the error message in the console, and
*then* shows the "Chose Application" box -- at this time, the error has
already occurred. We shouldn't see this dialog at all, it's a secondary
symptom, in my opinion.

(3) The error message in R.app's console points to a "MSL.framework" in
"Frameworks" inside the AR application bundle; and it says, the reason for
the error is "image not found". Well, the following is nothing more than a
wild guess: I had a look at the respective framework, and found that the
"Resources" subfolder in "MSL.framework" is *empty*. Maybe AR tries to load
an image that should be part of the framework resources but is missing.
(Possibly nothing more than a naive heuristic, I don't know...)

(4) Playing around with disabling this or that AR plugin in AR's Info window
didn't help. The same applies to changing the preferences or using a fresh
AR installation -- it just didn't work.

So we may have the following options:
-- Uninstall/trash AR
-- Getting used to the issue and permanently or temporarily disable the
   PDFViewer.plugin (Note that AR's "Repair" functionality, or an update,
   will most likely reinstall the plugin)
-- Trying to file a bug report to Adobe  (but I find this idea
   a bit too spooky, so please don't ask *me* ;-)

Cheers,
Joerg

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] RMySQL installation
Message-ID: <20061014211954.46788.qmail@web82407.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi All, 

I am trying to install RMySQL, but keep encountering
problems. From the biomaRT pdf (Oct 3) it seems that
one should be able to do the install using biocLite():
But this fails.

> source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
> biocLite("RMySQL")
Running getBioC version 0.1.8 with R version 2.4.0 
Running biocinstall version 1.9.8 with R version 2.4.0

Your version of R requires version 1.9 of
Bioconductor.
dependency '?RMySQL?' is not available



I have also tried to follow the guidlines for manually
specifying the location of the mysql libraries and
header files since I originally got an error like the
one below when compiling from source- still this did
not fix the problem either.


http://r.research.att.com/reports/tiger-universal/results/2.4.0/html/RMySQL.report.html

ERROR: configuration failed for package 'RMySQL'

Configuration error:

MySQL
libraries and the header files and re-run R CMD
INSTALL.

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Define and export the 2 shell variables
PKG_CPPFLAGS and
PKG_LIBS to include the directory for header files
(*.h)
and libraries, for example (using Bourne shell
syntax):

export PKG_CPPFLAGS="-I<MySQL-include-dir>"
export PKG_LIBS="-L<MySQL-lib-dir> -lmysqlclient"

Re-run the R INSTALL command:

R CMD INSTALL RMySQL_<version>.tar.gz

2. Alternatively, you may pass the configure arguments
--with-mysql-dir=<base-dir> (distribution directory)
or
--with-mysql-inc=<base-inc> (where MySQL header files
reside)
--with-mysql-lib=<base-lib> (where MySQL libraries
reside)
in the call to R INSTALL --configure-args='...'

R CMD INSTALL --configure-args='--with-mysql-dir=DIR'
RMySQL_<version>.tar.gz

** Removing
'/Builds/Rdev-web/QA/Simon/packages/tiger-universal/Rlib/2.4.0/RMySQL'


I then installed updated version of MySQL 5.0.16 via
Darwin ports and tried the above again (using option 1
to export the shell variables) - still get a similar
error though.

Any tips would be great.

Thanks, 
Noelle

I don't know as I cannot reproduce it. Could you also please send a  
complete description of you OS X installation? It is always the  
_same_ error? I might guess that this a problem related to the  
loading of the WebKit (Simon)?

R installer, installs one R.Framework in /Library/Frameworks and one  
application R.app in /Applications folder.
So if you remove the framework with something like

cd /Library/Frameworks
sudo rm -rf R.framework

(you need admin pwd) and you sen R.app into the trash, then you have  
completely removed R from your system

this is a different problem: every .pkg install a receipt of what  
installs in the folder /Library/Receipts
For example, in my case I have

R-Framework-ppc.pkg
R-Framework.pkg
R-GUI.pkg

so you should remove these as well if you want to avoid the "update"  
feature of Apple installer

there is no way to clean the R Console window on R.app, Maybe a

[This is a follow up on gcc3 vs. gcc4 discussion. Background: R  
benchmark tests ( http://www.sciviews.org/benchmark/index.html ) show  
a dramatic difference in "Escoufier's method on a 37x37 matrix  
(mixed)" test when comparing binaries for PowerPC compiled with gcc3  
vs gcc4.]

Thanks for the example. I think I have a clarification on this. On a  
higher level it's happening in "do_cov", but the underlying issue is  
the use of "long double" computations. First the results:

The timings I get (on 2xG5 2.7GHz) are:

gcc3: 0.8s
gcc4: 4.5s (dynamic libgcc)
gcc4: 4.2s (static libgcc)

Basically any calls that use long double will be affected:
qadd: 4.5s (gcc3 opt), 6.7s (Agcc4 opt), 7.4s (gcc3), 7.9s (gcc4 opt 
+dyngcc), 10.5s (Agcc4), 10.6s (gcc4 dyngcc)

(this test basically runs 500x 1M long double additions on an array -  
it's even more extreme if you run it on short arrays : 250kx1k will  
give 2s on gcc3 and 7.7s on gcc4)

Now, the actual reason is that gcc3 simply ignores "long double" and  
performs all computation using regular double precision (sizeof(long  
double)=8 in gcc3 and 16 in gcc4). What this means is that you lose  
precision in gcc3. To illustrate the impact, changing "long double"  
to "double" in gcc4 will bring the 250kx1k test down from 7.7s to  
2.1s which is almost the same as gcc3.

Thus, restricting R to double computations I get for the 37x37 test  
with gcc 4.0.3:
gcc4nld: 0.7s
which is actually even faster than the gcc3 result.

Attached you will find the R benchmarks 2.3 results (ran with R  
2.4.0) - there is pretty much no difference between the binaries  
except for the 37x37 test and the explanation is above.

Cheers,
Simon

Dear r-helpers,

I have reported problems such as these in the past but have not

Message-ID: <FC754745-6F24-4E11-8A05-39E720890690@stat.berkeley.edu>

I recently upgraded to R-2.4.0 and it seems that something broke the  
older framework I had installed (2.3.1 - or should I just say 2.3).  
Specifically it seems that some of the symlinks in /Library/ 
Frameworks/R.Framwork/Versions/2.3 was missing. I then (re)installed  
2.3.1 from the -mini.dmg file, and now I get

$ ls /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/*
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.2:
Resources

/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.3:
Headers        PrivateHeaders R              Resources

/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.4:
Resources

/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/Current:
Headers        PrivateHeaders R              Resources

This is the same situation as I had before I (re)installed 2.3.1,  
except that it was the 2.4 version that had all 4 directories.  
Because of the missing R symlink in 2.4/2.3 I cannot use RSwitch to  
switch between the versions (or rather, if I switch, the symlink /usr/ 
bin/R gets broken).

There may be something blindly obvious I am missing here, I have not  
had time to investigate properly.

It seems different from the situation I had with 2.2/2.3 where as far  
as I recall, RSwitch was working fine for me.

There are two separate issues:

1) How to make Apple Installer to "Install" R instead of "Upgrade"?

Run the following in the Terminal:
rm -rf /Library/Receipts/R-Framework* /Library/Receipts/R-GUI*

In the rare case that you are non-admin user and the receipts were  
kept locally (I've never encountered this, though), you should also run
rm -rf ~/Library/Receipts/R-Framework* ~/Library/Receipts/R-GUI*

(Note: the meta-package may still show Upgrade although the R will be  
freshly installed because of the accompanying tools - see the custom  
install sheet for details)

2) How to remove all R from the system?

Run the following in the Terminal:
sudo rm -rf /Library/Frameworks/R.framework

And delete R.app from wherever you installed it (usually the  
Application folder)

If you installed additional tools (gcc 4.0.3) and you want to remove  
those, run also
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/gcc4.0

If you want to remove a specific R version, look into /Library/ 
Frameworks/R.framework/Versions and delete the version you don't  
like. Adjust the "Current" softlink or use RSwitch to select another  
R version.

Update is not a bad thing at all - it compares existing files, so it  
will do a fresh install anyway if you deleted previous version  
manually. Therefore in most cases you don't really care whether the  
Installer does an update or a fresh install - in terms of the  
installed product it makes no difference. The only difference is that  
Update will remove files in the old version that are no longer  
present in the new version - so update will affect the previous  
version (if present). This is why the ReadMe screen in the R package  
instructs you to delete the receipt (as shown above) if you want to  
keep your old version.

Note that "upgrade" will still keep all additionally installed  
packages in the old version such that you can use the GUI to re- 
install all packages you had in the previous R version (see previous  
post on R-SIG-Mac).

Cheers,
Simon

Message-ID: <96F636CF537B634394703131EEE2006D0168732C@KING.COUGARS.INT>

Hi All
    I am working on a powerPC (G4) mac with OSX version 10.4.7.
    I upgraded from r-2.3.1 to r-2.4.0 recently using the universal  
    binary dmg file downloaded from CRAN. This is the complete, not mini  
    binary.

    The interactive environment works great, but I am having difficulty  
    installing packages that require C/C++ code to be compiled. This  
    includes my own packages and I have also tried the Matrix package.
    It looks like compilation is not the problem, linking is.  In  
    particular, when linking object files, every package install dies  
    with this message:
 
   /usr/bin/libtool: unknown option character `m' in: -macosx_version_min

    I use fink and libtool is installed at version  1.5.10.  Clearly this  
    looks like a configuration problem with my machine, but I am a bit  
    confused on where to go next.  Any pointers would be greatly  
    appreciated.
    cheers,
 
   Allan Strand

Andrew,

all the errors are related to some 3rd party plugin, so you're pretty  
much on your own. You could, however, try to use the latest R version  
(2.4.0) to see whether the issue still persists.

Cheers,
Simon

Message-ID: <5E7B7C7C-50F3-4819-BCF9-8550F7A00FD5@botany.utoronto.ca>

I downloaded the R-2.4.0.dmg, and was confronted with 4 packages,  
gcc403.pkg, R-GUI.pkg, R-Framework.pkg, and tcltk.pkg, along with a  
warning to use R.mpkg to install, which I didn't see anywhere.  What  
are these 4 packages, and which do I need for a basic install?  I am  
a UNIX and R newbie, but interested in learning.

Thanks!
Heather

Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.64.0610221730320.2885@rygar.gpcc.itd.umich.edu>

I have recently installed R 2.4 in my Intel based MacBook laptop. I want 
to access C functions from R source files (*.R files). Earlier I was using 
the commands

system('R CMD SHLIB file_name.c')
dyn.load('file_name.so')

in Linux based machines and it was working. But in the Mac machine the 
same command gives a warning messege

"Library/Framework/R.framework/Resources/bin/SHLIB : line 1 make: 
command not found" along with an error in dyn.load(...).

I would like to know what is the analogous command in Mac based R package.

Thank you,
Bodhisattva

The command is the same and works if you have all necessary tools  
installed.

That's not a warning, that's an error telling you that you don't have  
the necessary "make" command. You must install Apple Development  
Tools (aka Xcode) first. They are present either in the Applications/ 
Installers directory or on the Mac OS X DVD or they can be downloaded  
from ADC. (Please read the FAQ).

Could we get a thicker cursor or one with more contrast?  If I  color  
my console or editor with a dark background the thin gray/black  
cursor becomes nearly invisible.  A white outline would do help.

I'm using OS X 4.6, R 2.4. I want to install the package Hmisc. When I

Helen,

try using a different mirror - it appears as if the mirror you use  
returns garbage instead of the PACKAGES file.

I'm a new user of R and UNIX--i apologize if the questions are naive...

a) A command like plot(rnorm(1000)) responds in GUI R.app but not in  
the command-line version.

b) I downloaded a package from the internet, but R can't find it.   
Which directory does it need to be in for R to be able to access it?

Thanks!

a) You need to have X11 loaded and usually "export DISPLAY=:0.0" does  
the job (if you're connecting to a server through ssh, you need to  
use 'ssh -Y' in order to connect, after loading and exporting X11);

b) if you downloaded through R, it should be already installed. If  
you downloaded through a browser, it depends on your system  
configuration.

Please consider reading the documentation - your questions are  
answered there (see R FAQ and R for Mac FAQ).

The command-line version uses PostScript output by default, so the  
resulting plot will be in a file instead (Rplots.ps by default). Note  
that you need to use dev.off() to save the file (see R documentation  
for details).

If you want another, interactive plot device, you can use X11 (you  
must install it from Apple's DVD first as it is not installed by  
default) - start X11 (in Applications/Utilities) and type R there.  
However, in most cases you probably want to use the GUI instead.

It is easier to install the package that to download it manually,  
because the latter is more error-prone. Either use install.packages  
command in R or simply start the R GUI, select "Packages & Data" and  
"Package Installer", then click on "Get List" to receive the package  
list, select packages and click on "Install Selected". If you want to  
install packages manually, please note that there are different kinds  
of packages (source vs binary) and the former need additional tools  
installed before you can proceed. Again, this is all described in the  
documentation.

Cheers,
Simon

Ouch, then it's likely your ISP. You may want to check with your  
browser whether your ISP prevents you from using direct internet  
access. Another way to test it is to actually look at the file, e.g. try
download.file("http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/universal/contrib/ 
2.4/PACKAGES","/tmp/test.html")
system("open /tmp/test.html")
If everything is fine, is should be a long list of packages (looks  
wild in the browser), but if my suspicion turns out to be true, it  
should be some website from your ISP.

Cheers,
Simon

Well -- it DID come up with the long list of packages it was supposed 
to. I have in fact changed my ISP since the last time I installed 
packages, so have just come to a cafe with a Hotspot to double check, 
still get the same junk.

Howdy,

Short description:

I tried to install R 2.2.1, the Power PC version.  I can now run 2.2.1 from 
the terminal app but the GUI did not install.

--- Longer description ---

I have been using R 2.0.1, via the GUI, on my PowerPC OS10.3.9 Mac, but 
today attempted to upgrade this to 2.2.1.  I logged in as an administrator, 
downloaded from the link powerpc/R-2.2.1.dmg at 
cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/old.  I validated the md5 code, opened the 
.dmg file, the doubled clicked the top-level .mpkg file.

During install, it claimed it was going to install R.app in my applications 
folder.  However, no such file or folder is to be found.  I realize that it 
will appear in the finder as just plain R.  I have manually hunted for it, 
and have also used the finder's find function to search for it.  I note that 
the read-me-type info shown during installation describes a couple of the 
*other* packages as "optional" but provides no means to choose or not choose 
them.

The command-line r runs from the terminal window, which I presume means that 
the framework version installed OK.

The .dmg file has a subfolder called packages so I looked in there and saw 
four .pkg files, one of which was R-GUI.pkg.  Grasping at straws, I 
double-clicked on this and it brought up the installer.  Unfortunately, when 
it came to the panel which allows me to elect the destination folder, it 
marked my hard drive with a red exclamation point at grayed out the buttons 
that would allow me to choose a destination folder.

Please help.  I use R on a regular basis for my research (I'm a PhD 
student).  I regret having attempted to upgrade, because I have now lost the 
ability to use R at all.

--- Even longer description ---

The reason for attempting to upgrade was a difference I was seeing in the 
results from ks.test in R version 2.0.1 on my machine, vs R version 2.2.1 
accessed from RPy, on a different machine (the latter occasionally reports 
negative probabilities which is not a good sign).  In attempting to chase 
down that problem, I thought it would be a good idea to try 2.2.1 without 
RPy so I could isolate whether the problem was in RPy or R.

The reason I chose 2.2.1 instead of a newer version is twofold.  First, I 
wanted to compare results to the version 2.2.1 running on another machine.  
Second, I am running OSX 10.3.9, and am not interested in attempting to 
upgrade to 10.4.X at the moment.  The download page advises me that I can 
build the latest version from the source code, but I've been down that path 
before on three Macs and have never been anywhere close to successful.

Thanks for any help,
Bob H

Every Mac OS X has the Applications folder - that is where most  
applications are (such as Mail, Safari, Text Edit etc.)  - when you  
open finder the shortcut is on the left side of the window. If you  
can't find it, click on your system drive (by default Macintosh HD)  
and look for "Applications". If you really don't have that folder  
then your system is unusable anyway ;).

It does - the installer asks you whether you want to customize the  
installation.

You may want to check the status line to tell you why it won't let  
you install it. If in doubt, check the installer log.

Cheers,
Simon

Sorry, what I wrote was ambiguous.  Yes, of course I have an applications 
folder.  What I DON'T have is a folder in it named R.app.  Nor one named R 
(which is how it would appear in the finder).  I also tried using the 
finder's find function to search for files containing "R.app".  What I get 
is other applications that end with the letter R, but not R.  Clearly it has 
not been installed.

OK, running through the installation again now, I find the customize button. 
  I missed this on the first install.  And I missed it on my second install 
attempt because the installer wouldn't let me past the "select destination" 
panel.  In fact, that is the reason I was TRYING to re-install, because I 
was hoping there was a customization button that I'd missed.  But I was 
defeated by the installer halting me.

Sounds like a good idea.  I did not notice a status line while I was 
installing.  Is it in the installer log?
Could you tell me where I could find the installer log?

Anyway, re-installing again today got me past the panel that previously 
halted me and I was able to install the GUI.

I'm still interested in figuring out why it stopped me yesterday, in case I 
run into that problem again.  Where are the status line and installer log?

Thanks for your help,
Bob H

Menu "Window" -> "Installer Log". You may possibly want to select  
"Show Everything" at the bottom.

The log, see above, what I refer to as status line is the line at the  
bottom showing the reason for failure of a selected volume.

However, I checked both in the Tiger version of installer, so I'm not  
sure if exactly the same exists in the Panther Installer (I don't  
have a Panther machine anymore), so your mileage may vary.

Simon

Ah nuts.  I signed up using my me13013 at gmail account but accidentally

but google mail web site is having problems at the moment.  What a day!  
  First I get wrong answers from R via Rpy, then in investigating that I  
try to upgrade R and the installation fails, leaving me without R.   
Then in trying to report it I can't access gmail.  Phooie!
