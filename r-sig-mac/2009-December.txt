Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] make install fails
Message-ID: <339FF0CC-58CE-4C3C-924F-B3BB4A1E76A6@stat.berkeley.edu>

Fresh R-devel (as well as R-2.10) on a fresh install of Snow Leopard (not an upgrade).  Using Xcode 3.2.1.  Building in a separate directory from the source.

../R-devel-src/configure $OPTIONS
make
sudo make install

The sudo make install fails with

<SNIP>
mkdir /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.11/Resources/share/locale/en at quot/LC_MESSAGES
  en at quot
make -f ../R-devel-src/Makefile.fw top_srcdir=../R-devel-src install
Creating R framework ...
/bin/bash: line 0: cd: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/lib: No such file or directory
make[1]: *** [install-R-framework] Error 1
make: *** [install] Error 2

This setup worked (on Leopard) when I had installed the CRAN binary and then compiled R-devel myself.  My guess is that something is up with the install script, but that it only gets triggered in this specific case (fresh install).

My $OPTIONS are
../${SRCDIR}/configure SHELL='/bin/bash' \
  r_arch=x86_64 \
  CC="/usr/bin/gcc-4.2 -arch x86_64 -std=gnu99" \
  CFLAGS="-g -O2 -std=gnu99 -march=nocona" \
  CXX="/usr/bin/g++-4.2 -arch x86_64" \
  CXXFLAGS="-g -O2 -march=nocona" \
  OBJC="/usr/bin/gcc-4.2 -arch x86_64" \
  F77="/usr/bin/gfortran-4.2 -arch x86_64" \
  FFLAGS="-g -O2 -march=nocona" \
  FC="/usr/bin/gfortran-4.2 -arch x86_64" \
  FCFLAGS="-g -O2 -march=nocona" \
  --x-includes=/usr/X11/include --x-libraries=/usr/X11/lib \
  --with-system-zlib \
  --with-blas='-framework vecLib' --with-lapack

The offending line is line 36
35        @## the resulting libR will point dyld to the fat libR regardless of its origin
36 (part of)        @(cd "$(R_FRAMEWORK_DIR)/Resources/lib" && \                                                
 
$R_FRAMEWORK_DIR/Resources exists, but does not have a "lib" subdir.

My guess is that the cd command ought to be cd $(R_FRAMEWORK_DIR)/Libraries instead of $(R_FRAMEWORK_DIR)/Resources/lib

I'll keep away from my system for some hours in case someone wants me to probe deeper and/or test.

Not for me - I have just tried exactly your script on a clean 10.6.2  
system and it worked without problems...

Wrong guess (Libraries is a symlink to lib). "lib" should be there  
from the install target.

Can you, please, send me the output of

ls -l /Library/Frameworks/R.framework
ls -l /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions
ls -l /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.11
ls -l /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.11/Resources

Thanks,
Simon

I see - you have a rogue directory
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources
in all normal installations that is a symlink but apparently you may  
have used hard copy or something such that it's not a symlink.
If you remove that all should be well. What you have there is  
definitely not a clean system ;). I have put a guard about such  
strange framework setup in the R-devel, just in case.
Cheers,
Simon

Thanks. rm -Rf /Library/Frameworks/R.framework did the trick, so it was obviously an error on my end.

My system is/was clean insofar as all I have done regarding R is use ./configure, make, make install on a freshly formatted harddrive.  One possible explanation for this could be a C-c during make install or a make install without sudo.  Granted, I do not see why either of these possibilities would create a non symlink.  This is based on a review of my bash history, which - unfortunately in this case - removes duplicate entries, so it is hard to see exactly what I did in what order.

Anyway, it is probably pointless to speculate about the cause.

I think I found the culprit.  I installed the devpack before I compiled R, and looking at the contents of the tarball it does install things in /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources.  That must have created the hard link.

One possible explanation for this could be a C-c during make install or a make install without sudo.  Granted, I do not see why either of these possibilities would create a non symlink.  This is based on a review of my bash history, which - unfortunately in this case - removes duplicate entries, so it is hard to see exactly what I did in what order.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] ODBC driver with postgresql
Message-ID: <38CC6FD3-E1E4-4246-8883-CDF0B6EFDC45@coote.org>

For some reason I've got a problem with double precision numbers in  
postgres coming across into R as integers (they're just truncated).

I'm using:
R 2.10.0 GUI 1.30 Leopard build 32-bit (5511)
R-RODBC version 1.3
I've tried both the packaged postgresql odbc driver for the mac and  
rebuilt from source with the same results (psqlodbc-08.04.0100),  
against postgres 8.4 on my mac and against 8.3 on Fedora Linux.

the odbc driver works as expected with python + pyodbc, and with R  
2.10, RODBC (R-RODBC-1.2-2.fc10.i386, R-2.10.0-2.fc10.i386).

Here's some noddy results (I create a table called x with with one  
double precision column) - I'm ignoring the warning, which seems to be  
a distro error for fc10:

 From R on Linux:

1              0               1     16517           0

Uid and pwd obfuscated. As far as I can see, the driver on the mac is  
correctly identifying the type of the column 'x' as a float8, but then  
truncating before the decimal point.  I have seen somewhere that  
Oracle drivers used to suffer from this issue, when they truncated  
type 6 variables.

python looks ok on the mac:
 >>> import pyodbc
 >>> c=pyodbc.connect (dsn="Hg")
 >>> cu=c.cursor().execute ("select * from x")
 >>> print cu.fetchall()
[(1.234, ), (43.988999999999997, )]

I cannot find a pyodbc equivalent to sqlColumns. As far as I can see,  
R and python on my mac are using a common stack, and R seems to work  
ok with the fedora odbc drivers. Is it likely that I've still got bugs  
in my odbc set up or is there an issue with R + ODBC?  I'm not sure  
where else to look for what's going wrong.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] R does not remember history
Message-ID: <D080E247-905B-4F05-A583-400085DEEF0E@gmail.com>

Dear all,

my installation of R has gone weird lately. It seems to delete the contents of the history every time I close it. When I manually add history items, R loads them at startup. The issue really seems to be R deleting the history and not writing anything to it, either. If anybody has an idea about this, I`d highly appreciate it.

Regards,
Paul

Message-ID: <66b6c3540912051205u41079489x7728297671f5efd@mail.gmail.com>

Dear R people,

I am running OS 10.5.8 on my PowerBook G4 and unfortunately it will
not allow me to upgrade to Snow Leopard, because it does not run an
Intel Chip.

I have downloaded a version of R and it does not appear to be stable.
I have thought about about installing Linux to ensure a stable build
but unfortunately I bought the PowerBook G4 used and I did not come
with install disks.  The Leopard install disks I do have refuse to run
on an non-Intel machine.  So if I installed Linux, that would mean
that I would have to uninstall OS X and I probably would not be able
to reinstall it.

So I guess I am wondering if anybody has a build of R that they know
is stable on 10.5.8.  Also, I am sure there are other potential
solutions that I have not thought of.

Any recommendations?

Thank you for your time,
Francis

That is a bit vague.

I currently have R 2.8.0 on a G4 PB running 10.5.7. I don't remember  
that there was a conscious decision not to upgrade R, I also cannot  
remember if I had a reason not to go to OSX 10.5.8. Almost all of my R  
work is on later Macs and the PB now is just for checking PowerPoint  
presentations for compatibility with OpenOffice.

Not sure I know much else to say other than you can get old disk-image  
versions of the universal 32 bit build here:

Dear R.app developers

Would be a nice feature if one could change the default help browser  
to an external application, e.g. Safari or Firefox.

Thanks

It's configured by your system's default::

You can over-ride this in your .Rprofile

I am using R from ESS, with X11 as the default graphics device.
In due course, when I run a function that tries to open a new
graphics window, I get the message:

> g10.6()
Error in X11(d$display, d$width, d$height, d$pointsize, d$gamma, d$colortype,  : 
 unable to start device X11cairo
In addition: Warning message:
In device.call(...) : cairo error 'out of memory'

This was happening also under R-2.9.1; decided I had better
report/inquire.  I then have the choice of opening a quartz
window, or restarting both R and X11.

Neither of these works:

options(browser="/Applications/Firefox\ 2.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox")
?table # opens R.app internal browser
options(browser="/Applications/Firefox\ 2.app")
?table # still opens R.app internal browser

I'm not sure this is an improvement, but it's easy to do:

1.  Create your own "print.help_files_with_topic" function, copied from 
the private one in utils:

print.help_files_with_topic <- utils:::print.help_files_with_topic

2.  Edit it so it doesn't replace the browser when .Platform$GUI == 
"AQUA" && type == "html".

That's it  ---  now it will respect your choice of getOption("browser").

My apologies. The options()$browser setting handles the application  
that is dispatched by RSiteSearch. I did not understand what your  
arguments were doing. After reading the man page for "open" I tried  
using the -a argument and it seems to work. This demonstrates a  
successful switch between Safari and Firefox for that purpose (but not  
for your request):

 > options(browser="/usr/bin/open -a /Applications/Safari.app")
 > help(str)
 > RSiteSearch("splines")
A search query has been submitted to http://search.r-project.org
The results page should open in your browser shortly
 > options(browser="/usr/bin/open -a /Applications/Firefox.app")
 > RSiteSearch("splines")
A search query has been submitted to http://search.r-project.org
The results page should open in your browser shortly

See also:
?help.start

You can browse the contents of help packages using your specified  
browser with :

 > help.start(update = TRUE, gui = "irrelevant",
+            browser = getOption("browser"), remote = NULL)
Making packages.html . done
If '/usr/bin/open -a /Applications/Firefox.app' is already running, it  
is *not* restarted, and you
     must switch to its window.
Otherwise, be patient ...

But it does not seem to affect what application handles help() requests.

Thank you, Duncan. I think it could be an improvement on my system  
because the R Rd browser fails to link to follow external URL's in the  
most recent MacOS incarnation. You can copy and paste to a browser,  
but you get failure and sometimes you get freezes.

For instance when I just clicked in an R browser window that linked to  
your document "Parsing Rd files.pdf" the window fills with the first  
page of the pdf, but the spinning pinwheel-of-death appears and will  
not resolve. This is fairly predictable, so fortunately I had saved my  
work before doing this, so I would be able to recreate my intermediate  
results after a force-quit.

FWIW that makes no difference as we don't build anything specially for Snow Leopard. And, yes, ppc is no longer supported by Apple since 10.6.

Can you tell us which version, please? I know that you already answered that you're happy with 2.9.2 but unless you tell us there may be more users sharing your frustration ... I don't have any ppc machines anymore so I cannot easily test that ...

R is supposed to be stable but there was one big change in the R.app GUI for R 2.10 which may be the culprit (but then there were some GUI mismatch reports in the Tiger build so possibly the Leopard build is fine...). The real question is whether you installed the Tiger or the Leopard build of R (both work on your machine). Once we know we can try to trace that back ...

Cheers,
Simon

You may want to report that to R-devel (possibly with more details such as a reproducible example - I don't think g10.6() is in any recommended package...) since the X11 device is not Mac-specific.

Good point. We're intentionally overriding the "browser" option in the R.app GUI because help pages are treated differently from other "regular" browseURL calls. However, it may make sense to allow a user override. I'll look into this. You will, however, lose the built-in help feature so I would not recommend it as the default.

Thanks,
Simon

As this occurs only after some combination of computations and
use of graphics commands, maybe extending over several days,
it is not possible to provide a reproducible example.   Once the
session gets into this state, any attempt to open an X11 window
triggers the output that I obtained.  It seems unimportant whether
this is a direct call to x11(), or to a plotting function that requires
the opening of an X11 window.  

So all that I can usefully report on may be the state of my session 
when the behaviour was triggered.  I wll try running a large number 
of graphics commands in a new session, that open and close the 
X11 graphics device, to look for a sequence of commands that 
consistently triggers the behaviour.

(Note. if there is an "overview" link, clicking on the link works. Clicking on a browse "directory" link also doesn't do anything).

Hi Simon,

I am not sure if you saw the email that I responded to that David
sent.  In that response I used the link he sent me.  In that response
I used the versions listed on the link.

And described exactly what I did that resulted in it freezing up.

I hope this is clear.  If it is not, I am happy to provide whatever
additional information would be useful.  I think the r-team does
amazing work and I would be happy to help in whatever way I can.

In case you missed that email, I have copied it below.

The referenced R installs are from
http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/R/CRAN/bin/macosx/universal/base/ and the two
are R-2.10.0.dmg and R-2.9.2.dmg

Cheers!
Francis

Hi David,

I know I was being vague when I posted but I had gotten frustrated
with R and deleted it hours before and I was not sure what the version
was at the time.  But now I am.

Version R-2.10.0 worked on startup and worked when I typed >1:10
however it froze when I typed >f() without f being defined.  There
were other functions that caused it to freeze, but I did not keep
track of all of them.

So I tried R-2.10.0 and it froze again under identical circumstances.

I went to the next oldest version R-2.9.2 and it froze on the last
stage of the installation process.  I forced it to quit and went to
the application folder and so far it is stable.

If it has problems, I will just keep going back to older releases.

Thank you for your help,
Francis

Those are for Tiger (10.4), please try the R-2.10.0.pkg which is for Leopard (10.5) and let me know if the problem persists.

Simon,

The latest version seems to be working perfectly now that I have the
right install.

Thanks for that.  Sorry about the fuss.  I am new to Macs.

What is "new"?

.libPaths() would need a character argument. Are you referring to this

No - if it doesn't appear, it means the directory doesn't exist. (This  
was always the case, that's nothing new in 2.10).

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] *** caught bus error *** address 0x1143d2c7b,
	cause 'non-existent physical address'
Message-ID: <8FAF9B30-3E96-46A9-AA3F-AD624CB43318@pueo-owl.ch>

Using R version 2.10.1 RC (2009-12-06 r50681) in 64-bit mode (R.app  
GUI 1.30 (5528) x86_64-apple-darwin9.8.0) on a MacBook Pro 17" unibody  
early 2009 with 8GB RAM.  The following code is causing the error  
message "*** caught bus error *** address 0x1143d2c7b, cause 'non- 
existent physical address'"

 > library(filehash)
 > db <- dbInit("/Volumes/Work on RDR Test Documents/R Databases/ 
DB_TXT", type = "RDS")
 > dbLoad(db)
 >
 > sent.all <- unlist(sentences.all)[-index.tokenless.sentences]
 > i.samp <- sample(c(1:length(sent.all)), 100)
 > sent.all[which(sentences.most.predicted.rf_003_2009.12.07[i.samp]  
== F)]

sentences.all is a data frame in the filehash database.  It is loaded  
into the environment with the dbLoad statement.  More precisely, it is  
"lazy loaded."

If I first assign  
which(sentences.most.predicted.rf_003_2009.12.07[i.samp] == F) to,  
say, iF, then evaluate sent.all[iF], the error does not occur.

I thought I solved this problem the last time it plagued me by  
downloading the source from CRAN instead of the binary.  I did that  
again before attempting to reproduce the error, but this time it  
didn't help.  I wish I could supply more information, but the error  
message isn't at all helpful.

I only suspect filehash because (a) it evidently hasn't be updated in  
a while, and (b) the lazy loading mechanism could be playing a role,  
even though the statement sent.all <- unlist(sentences.all)[- 
index.tokenless.sentences] seems to create a copy.

Can anybody suggest how I can at least identify where the error is  
actually occurring?  I am not a programmer, have not debugging tools  
installed, could probably install one, but would need very detailed  
instructions about  using it.

Thanks,
Richard

My apologies for such a simple question.  I have a new Mac and I want to 
make a permanent change to the font size for R.  I simply don't know how 
to change the size of the font or make it permanent.  cntl - + is not

The Mac OS X FAQ says you should be able to set this in Preferences  
but the Quartz tab on my device has the "Change" button greyed out.

Hi,

I've just encountered a tiny "bug" in the function quartz.save. It doesn't expand e.g. a leading ~ in the file name.

To fix this one could maybe change the function declaration to:

...
oc$device <- quartz
oc$type <- type
oc$file <- path.expand(file)
oc$dpi <- dpi
...


Cheers,

Well, it's not documented to do so - it's really just pass-through for  
quartz() so if anything this is a wishlist item for the quartz()  
command. I'll see if we can accommodate that ...

At least from the perspective to be consistent in writing a valid file path I would vote to put this at the end of quartz()'s wish list :)

The consistency is: those functions that do tilde expansion document 
it.  Those that do not document it should not be assumed to do so.

More to the point, quartz.save is hidden away in R.app and is 
completely undocumented (at least, according to the help system), and 
I did not know it existed.  Since quartz() is usable from R (the 
terminal command line, embedded ...) at the Mac console, could not 
quartz.save() be in package utils and be documented?

That was partially on purpose ;) - it used to be an R.app-only goodie.

I suppose so. The original implementation was R.app-specific, but  
admittedly the current one works even outside so it's worth doing that  
- I'll have a look.

Simon

I did so and restarted. I checked my ~/.Rprofile setting and that is  
not the source of the persistent non-R.Framework libpath. I reviewed  
the Macs section of the Installation Manual and it tells me that it's  
basically a Unix device and that I should review the general R  
instructions.

Reading the Installation and Administration Guide in section 6 I see  
several areas about which I am uninformed:

 > R.home(component="home")
[1] "/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources"

I don't have an R_HOME/etc/Rprofile.site

I think I have found my problem because:
Sys.getenv("R_LIBS_USER")
                R_LIBS_USER
"~/Library/R/2.10/library"

So I tried Sys.setenv(R_LIB_USER = "")

I thought from the help page that this would report a logical value  
for success or failure, but got neither. Wish me luck.

Uh - all that has nothing to do with what I was saying - remove the ~/ 
Library/R/2.10/library directory, that's all you need to do ...

Message-ID: <D242FE5B-3196-446A-B7D8-ED654D95EB84@uni-potsdam.de>

Hi,

this is a possible (minor) bug report for R.app GUI:

Installing a source package from R.app GUI fails when the path to the package contains a blank. For example, after a click on "Install..." button and selection of package eyetrackR_0.12.tar.gz, the following error indicates that the argument passed on to gzip was not correctly escaped.

gzip: /Users/jochen/Projects/R.gz: No such file or directory
gzip: library/potsdam/eyetrackR/eyetrackR_0.12.tar.gz: No such file or directory
ERROR: cannot extract package from ?/Users/jochen/Projects/R library/potsdam/eyetrackR/eyetrackR_0.12.tar.gz?

Everything works fine from Terminal.app using R CMD install eyetrackR_0.12.tar.gz 

Best, jochen

Message-ID: <20091212123929.50p1116dpk0ogss0@imp.inserm.fr>

Hi,

I'm still getting a spinning ball followed by a crash (report follows)
on a Mac mini powerpc even with the latest RC.  To make this
happen in a repeatable way, I just start the R.app, type some
random text and hit ESC.  It doesn't seem to happen when R
is run from a terminal window.  The crash report lists the
GUI as for R 2.10.0 but as you can see from the sessionInfo,
I was running the R 2.10.1 RC.  When I uploaded R 2.10.0 when
it was first released, it did something similar, where it
listed the GUI at 2.9 instead.  Thanks if you can track
this down.

best,

Ken

It's a shell command, you type that in the Terminal. From R you can also do that using
system("defaults write org.R-project.R force.LANG en_US.UTF-8")

Cheers,
Simon

PS: If you want any additional help, please include sessionInfo() and the exact GUI version string as well as the custom local settings you're using.

In the latest GUI (1.31-rc) you can enable external browser for the help pages by setting the use.external.help preference to YES. It's not recommended (since it sort of disables the help system), but for those that requested it it's now possible.

Cheers,
Simon


to enable (in Terminal):
defaults write org.R-project.R use.external.help YES

to revert to default:
defaults delete org.R-project.R use.external.help

However, it may make sense to allow a user override. I'll look into this. You will, however, lose the built-in help feature so I would not recommend it as the default.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] new raster image support in r-devel
Message-ID: <4B25A74C.8020905@auckland.ac.nz>

Hi

In the *development* version of R, there are two new functions, 
grid.raster() and grid.cap(), in the 'grid' package, which draw (and 
capture) raster (bitmap) images
(see http://developer.r-project.org/Raster/raster-RFC.html)

There has been a report that this is not working on the quartz() device 
on MacOS X 10.5 (Leopard?), specifically i386-apple-darwin9.8.0

The test is simply ...

library(grid)
quartz()
grid.text("test")
cap <- grid.cap()
# Crash and burn

If anyone has a system like this, and is happy to install the 
development version of R on that system, I would appreciate a 
confirmation of this problem.

Thanks for any help

Leopard, latest version, using Apples gcc 4.2. SVN version r50716

I get a crash (memory not mapped).  The traceback shows grid.Call("L_cap"), followed by .Call(fname, ...., package = "grid")

Message-ID: <941E370D-807F-48DA-BD25-2681B3B40B56@gmail.com>

Dear list members,

Does anyone know how to add items to the menu bar in R ?
Certain packages have their own custom menus, which allow access to different functions, but I haven't been able to figure out what the trick was with these.
I have been looking at GUI interface packages such as fgui and the like but in vain.

Any help or suggestions greatly appreciated !

It depends on the front-end.  In Windows Rgui, look at ?winMenuAdd.

It works for me w/o problems:
Mac OS X 10.6.2 (10C540)
[R.app GUI 1.31 (5536) i386-apple-darwin9.8.0] (also directly)
R version 2.11.0 Under development (unstable) (2009-12-13 r50716)
i386-apple-darwin9.8.0

locale:
[1] en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/C/C/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8

attached base packages:
[1] grid      stats     graphics  grDevices utils     datasets   
methods   base

(official Leopard build from r.research.att.com)

So if you can replicate this, please either a) get a full stack trace  
or b) specify exactly how you configure R, compilers, locale etc. Also  
make sure you don't have some old library with R packages around.

Cheers,
Simon

Oops, I was so focused on things breaking in SL that I missed that  
this one breaks on Leopard only :)
Anyway, yes, the exact same binary breaks on Leopard:

I'll nave a look after I'm done with the 2.10.1 release...

The crash is fixed, but there are IMHO serious issues with the

That'd be great.  Thanks.

(Thanks also to Kasper for confirming the problem)

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] ODBC driver with postgresql
In-Reply-To: <38CC6FD3-E1E4-4246-8883-CDF0B6EFDC45@coote.org>
References: <38CC6FD3-E1E4-4246-8883-CDF0B6EFDC45@coote.org>
Message-ID: <A8ED12A1-09BB-4CA0-B774-8E7B4BB7B9C8@coote.org>

I now have a simplistic fix for this error. I have no idea how to  
create test or submit a patch. Indeed, i've got zero familiarity with  
the testing model.

Here's the skinny. The RODBC.c driver code does not handle SQL_FLOATs  
(ie DATA_TYPE 6 in my original posting) returned by the odbc driver,  
so they fall through to the default encoding mechanism, which is  
character based (I think). As far as I can see, all that's needed is  
to include SQL_FLOAT to all of the SQL_DOUBLE cases in three switch  
statements. (one in cachenbind, two in RODBCFetchRows.)

I'd guess that the reason that I've found this bug on the mac is that  
my linux box (Fedora Core 10) uses an older version of RODBC (rpm: R- 
RODBC-1.2-2.fc10.i386) and the bug's crept in between the two  
versions. However, I've not diff'd the sources. It could just be that  
no one else uses RODBC + PostgreSQL.

What's the process for submitting a suitable patch? or is the above  
description enough to be picked up by the package maintainers?

Well my fix is clearly inadequate as I'm getting malloc errors when I  
re-read the information :-(

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] quartz() cannot find fonts
Message-ID: <4B2A46F90200004F0002F075@billie.usc.edu.au>

Hi all

I am a long-time R user, who has just recently traded in my old linux box for a Mac.  That is, I am reasonably familiar with R, but not (yet) with Macs.

I am having this problem when producing graphics with quartz() (but not x11()):

This problem has been reported before on the list, but has not (as far as I can see) been resolved.

Any advice much appreciated.

Arial is a Microsoft font, try switching to Helvetica (Arial is a  
clone of this font)

Thanks Byron.

Is there a way to ensure this happens automatically on the Mac?  (As the example code shows, I didn't explicitly request any particular font.)

The help for quartz() states Helvetic *is* the default font.

This partially works, but it looks like "Arial" is still, somewhere and somehow, being beckoned.  I don't know how R on the Mac works to know what's going on:

> quartz(family="Helvetica")
> hist(rnorm(100))
There were 19 warnings (use warnings() to see them)
> warnings()
Warning messages:
1: In title(main = main, sub = sub, xlab = xlab, ylab = ylab,  ... :

I cannot reproduce the problem on 2.10.0 with Leopard. You would have  
a higher concentration of Mac-R experts on the R-SIG-Mac list.

Peter, what do you get if you execute the following command:

quartz.options()$family


?

Tim,

Coming to this with a bit of a delay, but one of the things that you  
may wish to try is to set 'rows_at_time = 1' in your calls to  
sqlQuery(). See the help file for the function.

Prior to RODBC version 1.3-0, this defaulted to 1. However, beginning  
with 1.3-0, the default changed to 100.

I had problems with the new default value using RODBC connecting to an  
Oracle server. These were typically queries returning 0 rows, where I  
knew that there should be more than that and typically in the  
hundreds. The problem manifested itself when the view names were > 11  
or 12 characters. This had suggested the possibility of a pointer gone  
awry, stepping on and corrupting the query result. However, I could  
never confirm that and Prof. Ripley could not replicate the problem on  
his end.

I think that lacking further investigation, it may be representative  
of a bug in the ODBC driver itself.

Setting 'rows_at_time' to 1 has resolved the problem for me and you  
should see if that resolves anything in your situation.

BTW, the error message that you get below after loading RODBC on Linux  
suggests that you need to re-install it. It appears to have been built  
using a prior version of R, before dynamically generated help files  
were introduced in recent versions.

I was wondering, does R allow you to open a data editor, look at all
data, variable names, variable labels, and sort by multiple variables?
 Would you want to use R if you have to clean a complex data set in R?

If R does not have an advanced data editor is there an open source
program that would handle these tasks well?

Thanks,

Hi, Francis.

If you are looking for a GUI to examine your data, like Excel, then
not really.  However, R is exactly the place to go for "cleaning"
complex data.  See, for example, the functions summary(), head(),
colnames(), sort(), and order().

R IS an advanced data editor.  However, the interace is not point-and-click.

I would echo that opinion. Compared to the point-and-click data  
editing in the SAS product, JMP, which some might be inclined to call  
advanced, the R facilities are much more efficient and flexible.

I would use the spreadsheet in OpenOffice for that.  The data editor in 
R is quite limited.

Obviously I would like something also promoting the value of R in

Message-ID: <9940DE3A-7AF7-4B41-857C-F1762934C89D@asu.edu>

Hello.

My apologies in advance if this has been asked and answered, but I can't seem to find the information I need.

I am trying to run an R program from the terminal.  As a trivial example, I run  R --arch=x86_64 CMD BATCH /Users/mpittinsky/Desktop/test.r /Users/mpittinsky/Desktop/testoutput.txt, where the test.r program is the loading of a library (just to debug).  The library in question loads when I run the command from R64 console.  (The "real" program involves a  set of data cleaning and analysis functions).

I receive the errors:

/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/bin/R: line 231: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/bin/exec/x86_64/R: No such file or directory
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/bin/R: line 231: exec: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/bin/exec/x86_64/R: cannot execute: No such file or directory

These directories do not, indeed, exist.  Only an i386 directory does and the above program works fine when the arch specified is i386. 

I installed R using the latest version at http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/, so I am on 2.10.0.  I am running Mac OS 10.6.2.  

Thanks in advance for any suggestions.

Hi,

I think you need to download R 64bit from there http://r.research.att.com/exp/

The you have only 32-bit R (Tiger build). If you want  64-bit you have to download the Leopard build (R-2.10.1.pkg form CRAN)(.


> I installed R using the latest version at http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/, so I am on 2.10.0.  I am running Mac OS 10.6.2.  


There are two (Tiger and Leopard) and you use the wrong one (for what you want) - it's worth actually reading that page before you download it.

Christophe,

Thank you!  Problem solved.  I was hesitant to install builds other than the main one, which I thought installed fully for all three architectures.  At least for my machine, it did not, but 2.10.1 did the trick.

Appreciate it.

This has also include idea that researchers should supply data and code, allowing for someone else to reproduce their research.

Message-ID: <375E2990-C269-4F30-A94C-F7983F14D5FF@gmx.de>

Hi all,

the cairoDevice package is not available as a binary on CRAN right now.
I tried to compile it from source, which renders the following:

	mark-heckmanns-macbook:~ markheckmann$ R CMD INSTALL  
cairoDevice_2.10.tar.gz
	* installing to library ?/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/ 
library?
	* installing *source* package ?cairoDevice? ...
	checking for pkg-config... pkg-config
	ERROR: gtk+2.0 not found by pkg-config.
	ERROR: configuration failed for package ?cairoDevice?
	* removing ?/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/library/ 
cairoDevice?

1) Is there a manual way to fix this as GTK+2.0 is installed?
2) Will there be a fix in the future?

TIA
Mark

The "manual way" is to set your environment properly. How, that's entirely up to you and your GTK+ -- for example if you are using the CRAN version of GTK+ framework you have to add
/Library/Frameworks/GTK+.framework/Resources/bin
to your PATH.

Not on our end, it's hard to fix users ;). If you want to compile packages from sources, you'll have to make sure you have all requirements in place - that's your responsibility. (BTW cairoDevice is not on CRAN in binary form because it doesn't pass check so even the above may not work -- but in that case you should really ask the RGtk2 maintainer ...).

Cheers,
Simon

Message-ID: <746b43cb0912220634g47781ca9j5dac8ac8a0f10f29@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings all

I have left R aside for about a week and upon going back to it I have
found errors which I had not encountered before. I have upgraded to
OSX 10.6 recently and these errors may be a consequence of such
upgrade.

A first error encountered at start-up refers to the use of my locale:

========

During startup - Warning messages:
1: Setting LC_CTYPE failed, using "C"
2: Setting LC_COLLATE failed, using "C"
3: Setting LC_TIME failed, using "C"
4: Setting LC_MESSAGES failed, using "C"

WARNING: You're using a non-UTF8 locale, therefore only ASCII
characters will work.
Please read R for Mac OS X FAQ (see Help) section 9 and adjust your
system preferences accordingly.

============

when trying to install a binary package from BioConductor, using the R
GUI, I get:

=-===========
The downloaded packages are in

This situation won't change if I set the locale to

Has anyone experienced this before?
Thank you in advance

Seems like it. Your system locales seem to be completely messed up.  
Seems like Archive&Install is probably what you want to do ... I have  
never seen this before so I don't know why your OS broke so badly. You  
may try the usual restore permissions, change locale, re-install OS X  
etc.

Cheers,
Simon

Thank you Simon. I have tried the changing locale option but got no
result. When you allude to restoring permissions, what are the files
that you have in mind?
Cheers

I meant fix permissions using Disk Utility - the usual step to take on a OS that acts funny, but I suspect you may have to re-install OS X in the end (the issue is not R-specific pretty much everything will fail on the locales as you can see from tar ...)

(BTW: you don't have Xcode installed so the failed source installation is due to that which is unrelated to the locales...).

I am getting a warning when using the example s on the help page for

The text of the Details section says that:

calls to {: see the ?Examples? section for how to create such a call."

So I am puzzled that "\{" is being removed.

Hmm, when I run example(body) I get

body> body(f) <- as.call(c(as.name("{"), e))

with no backslash.  And text help and the refman also have no 
backslash.

So, how are you doing this?  Cut-and-paste from HTML help?

I suspect this is yet another rendering problem with HTML help: I've 
fixed quite a few since 2.10.1 was released.

That is *not* what the message says: it says the backslash is being 
removed.

Yes; that was how I entered it, but just now I entered this line from  
the keyboard and got the same result:

Correct, as that is not a valid string in R ... R-devel gives an

Check "cleanup history entries" in the preferences.

Hm.. are you sure? The above setting is on by default so if you removed preferences it should be back to "on" ...

Hi,

I was wondering if someone could please direct me on how to choose the
best format in order to save, open, and use data.  I am currently
using datasets that are in csv format.  However, they are purely
numeric and I think I should be to reduce their size substantially.

Thank you for your time,

Hi Francis,

This isn't really the correct list for this question since it is a
general question about the use of R rather than one specifically related
to the use of R on OS X.

In terms of the answer to your question, the answer is it depends. If
you are working exclusively in R then saving your data to disk in a
*.RData file, via the save() function makes sense. If you are doing
spatial related things, and have GIS shapefile layers you will want to
work with at some point, or want to work with the data in other software
packages and need a file format that has some level of variable typing
(which isn't true in csv files) and is fairly "transportable", then
writing them into dbase format (via the write.dbf() function of the
foreign package) might also make sense.

The real reason to move things out of csv format isn't space (if space
is the only issue you can always store your data in a compressed
archive, such as a zip file, and uncompress files as needed), but
because csv (or any other text only format) lacks any variable typing,
one often finds that after reading a csv file into R, the resulting data
fields are not what they were expected to be.

R can read and write .gz files.  See gzfile().  Also, you can simply
save R objects using save().  See the help for that function.  Of
course, there is the R import/export manual that could be helpful, as
well.
