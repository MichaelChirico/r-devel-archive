Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] .Last( ) taking keyboard input hangs on command-Q
Message-ID: <0EB0AEC2-7250-4A79-AB70-73FFB146D0C0@upci.pitt.edu>

Dear Colleagues,

The recent change to R.app disabling q() and requiring command-Q or the equivalent
is well motivated.  However, it introduces a new problem for a user (like me) who
has a .Last() calling for user input, e.g. dialogs on choosing final actions to be taken.
After command-Q,
the console cannot accept keyboard input, and clicking on any of the buttons 
Don't Save, Save
does nothing.
Clicking Cancel works, but once you've clicked Don't Save or Save
clicking Cancel no longer does anything.
Then R.app has to be killed the ungracious way.

Thoughts?  Thanks.

Please use R 2.11.1 as this has been changed for some time and report if the issue still exists (with a reproducible example).

Thanks,

Dear all, 

i really have some issues using the standard R editor on Snow Leopard. On several occasions lines were cut off horizontally. Plus, there are problems with line breaks after copy pasting code from one window to another. Is there any quality editor or IDE for R? What do y?all use ?

thx in advance

I love TextMate. Well worth the cost. Add the RMate bundle
(http://tolstoy.newcastle.edu.au/R/e7/help/09/06/1073.html) and you're
golden. I use it for python programming too.

I use TextMate as main editor and the R/R Console/ R Daemon bundles. Especially the R bundle.
Furthermore R.app and R64.app for interactive use.

I have been trying to invoke cairoDevice on the Mac.
Is there something wrong with my setup that is causing
the API version mismatch?

Under R64, I get:

The message indicates that the cairoDevice package was compiled under 
a different version of R from the one you are using. (E.g. R 2.12.0 
will require API version 7, but cairoDevice will not currently 
compile under pre-2.12.0: if you try the version compiled under 2.11.x 
you do get this message.)

Did you compile this from the sources, or if not, exactly what file 
are you using?  The current CRAN binary download works for me with 
2.11.1 (i386 and x86_64).

It will only work if you have the appropriate Gtk2 package installed.
I am fairly sure the one my system is picking up is GTK_2.18.5-X11.pkg

I would make sure that you have R 2.11.1 and only that installed, then 
try again.

Not BTW a good idea: there's no need to cripple R's handling of data 
in this way.

Aquamacs (http://aquamacs.org/) if you are into that sort of thing.
ESS is built in and the code formatting tools alone are enough to stop
me from using other IDEs.

Thanks.

I have now upgraded to R-2.11.1 (the latest binary). 

My GTK is from GTK_2.18.5-X11.pkg

Cairo() still gives

You are saying that I need the version of cairoDevice that is

thx, everybody. I just downloaded aquamacs and probably will try to get a trial of textmate and share my experience here. 
Any suggestions to RMate vs Aquamacs ?

Dear all, 

in the meantime i got StatET for Eclipse, which really works well on first sight. 
This mailinglist post has interesting information on how to configure it, worked fine for me, running Snow Leopard: http://lists.r-forge.r-project.org/pipermail/statet-user/2009-May/000156.html

I also tried to aquamacs / Emacs, but had some trouble because it was not accepting my curly braces {} out of the box. Plus, I just got the R console running inside emacs and not my script submitted to R. Though, i?d like to give it another try  - so you have any suggestions how to get over the hump a little easier... go ahead :) . 

Does anybody have some experience with that R console inside Eclipse... somehow I do not really trust it yet, but that?s just a gut feeling.

best 

matt

Hi,

Sorry, I can't figure out what you mean by that. Could you please elaborate?

> Plus, I just got the R console running inside emacs and not my script submitted to R. Though, i?d like to give it another try ?- so you have any suggestions how to get over the hump a little easier... go ahead :) .

If you have an R process running within emacs (M-x R) and are
currently working in an R source buffer, you can send the contents of
the buffer to your inferior R process by hitting:

ctrl-c ctrl-l

Is that what you meant?

To send just the current line where your "point" is:

ctrl-c ctrl-j
or
ctrl-c ctrl-n

Here's an ess cheatsheet you can peruse:
http://ess.r-project.org/refcard.pdf

> Does anybody have some experience with that R console inside Eclipse...

I briefly flirted with Eclipse + StatET a long time ago, but didn't
really get into it.

> somehow I do not really trust it yet, but that?s just a gut feeling.

What about it seems so duplicitous to you?

Hi Steve, 

thx for the help with the buffer and the refcard, that really helps.

still i have the problem with the curly braces. if I hit alt+8 / alt+9 which is supposed to create curly braces on a mac, I am switched to the interface below the editor itself. 
I am it surprised by these issues because I though aquamacs was supposed to run on macs.

Hmm ... this is news to me.

I'm guessing this might be some international keyboard issue? Eg. on
my (US) keyboard, the curly brace is shift-[ and shift-].

I'm not really sure what to tell you if alt-8 is giving you "{" in
every program but emacs ... I'm sure there's some simple solution.

You mean the R console running inside emacs?

Yes, it only runs on macs, in fact.

You can find out where to get more aquamacs specific support here:

It is. For example, on my French Canadian keyboard, I enter {, }, [, ] with Option-7, 8, 9, 0, respectively. Problem is, by default Emacs on OS X assigns Option to Meta, so what Emacs receives is Meta-7, etc.

My cure for that: use Command for Meta and ditch all the Macish keybindings in Emacs. This is in part what motivated me to build a non-Macified distribution of GNU Emacs for OS X; see

	http://vgoulet.act.ulaval.ca/emacs/mac

So, to assign Command to Meta insert the following in your .emacs file (located in your personal directory):

(setq-default ns-command-modifier 'meta) ; Command is Meta
(setq-default ns-option-modifier 'none)	 ; Option is Option 

Just don't expect Command-C/V/X to work for copy/paste/cut. You'll have to learn the Emacs keybindings (M-w, C-y, C-w). Good thing: these are the same on all Emacsen on all platforms.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] cairoDevice and GTK under MacOS
Message-ID: <34AD6AD0-7EBB-480C-B591-79246B79CDE8@anu.edu.au>

Arising from my recent interchange with Professor Ripley,
it seems that there is no current binary for cairoDevice
that works under R 2.11.0 or 2.11.1.  This is in spite of the
current CRAN package check results that have OK for
cairoDevice under r-release MacOS X ix86

With each new release of R (and maybe release of OSX), 
there seems a sizeable risk that the cairoDevice/GTK 
combination will fail.

Is cairoDevice/GTK  in for the long haul?  Or is it likely
to be superseded by other GUI interface approaches?
If it is in for the long haul, what are the odds of getting
quickly to a point where one can have confidence that
it will be usable under OSX when a new version of R 
appears?  

This is not a criticism of the excellent work that has gone
into building cairoDevice/GTK.  Restriction of some
software to some systems has to be accepted as a fact
of life, especially where there is a large element of
innovation.  Rather, it is a request for any insight that 
may be available from those on this list who have some 
limited ability to peer into the future, or even actual
knowledge of the future!

I guess that some part of the answer will in due course
come from commercial users of R.   What is available
on the Mac may become more important now that Google
is, apparently, giving up support internally for use of 
Windows systems.

Seems?!? Based on what?!? Brian said clearly that there is a binary and it works for him -- so it does for me!

You never told us what *you* are using so there is not much we can do for you - from the output it seemed that you are using the wrong packages with wrong R versions so this is not about CRAN at all. His comments were based on the assumption that you are trying to build something for yourself because the CRAN packages work fine.

Cheers,
Simon

I did explain that I had installed the latest binary.  I had also tried to update cairoDevice.

I found that I had to remove the 2.10 library, then reinstall cairoDevice, and all is well.  Presumably cairoDevice was not updating in the 2.11 library (because the apparently identical version was in the 2.10 library?)  Updating cairoDevice did not, on its own, seem to be enough.

I find it surprising that I have to explicitly remove the 2.10 library.  I presume that this is a quirk, and can be removed in later releases.

What I needed to know was that others who were using the binary had been able to install and use cairoDevice.

I was confused by Brian's comment that:

"
(E.g. R 2.12.0 will require API version 7, but cairoDevice will not currently compile under pre-2.12.0: if you try the version compiled under 2.11.x you do get this message.)
"

if you try the version compiled under 2.11.x [with R 2.12.0] you do get this message.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Request command key change in R gui
Message-ID: <E07A3538-EABF-4B33-A22C-C6AC731ABDAD@mac.com>

Hi,

I'd like to request a change in one of the command key shortcuts in the R gui. Currently, "Source Document" is cmd-E. This is much more commonly used in most Cocoa apps as "Replace Selection for Find", e.g. Xcode, TextWrangler, Mail, Pages, etc. I use it quite often, and I have to always note that R is the exception to this, using cmd-opt-E instead (which is sometimes used for "Use Selection for Replace").

I propose that cmd-E be changed to the more standard command, and that "Source Document" be replaced with cmd-R (mnemonic for 'run').

I know that changing what is probably a commonly used command might be a little painful for some in the short term, but I think consistency with other apps is a bigger gain.

Cheers,
Demitri

Thanks, Simon, for your reply.

This is reproducible with 2.11.1, both 32 and 64 bit.
With the following .Last, command-Q hangs, there's no exit except an external kill,
and .RData will not be saved.

Not a big problem if you're aware of the behavior;
otherwise, one might lose a few hours of work.
I don't expect a fix; this note is meant to prevent others
making the same mistake I made one day.

On the sunny side, if .Last writes something to a file,
it completes with no problem.

Hi,

Perhaps you are using a version of R lower than 2.11.1
see http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.r.general/191995

If not, I will compile it myself.
I don't see anything in the changelog to indicate that this is

You may not find it easy.  The issue is that RQuantLib depends on 
QuantLib, in fact on a recent version of QuantLib (later than the one 
in the current Fedora distribution, for example).  QuantLib is a large 
C++ suite of programs, and I've failed to compile it on Linux in the 
past, and when I have succeeded the package failed its own tests.

> I don't see anything in the changelog to indicate that this is

It is done by Simon Urbanek's autobuiilder.  I don't see anything 
which indicates that it is not deliberate ....

If you look at the packages which are not being built by the Mac 
autobuiilder you will see three main reasons why:

(a) the package fails its tests, e.g. lme4
(b) the package depends on other packages which are not available on 
the build machine, usually from BioC or OmegaHat.
(c) the package depends on external software.

RQuantLib is in category (c), and very few such packages are being 
built (not even Simon's own packages GDD and proj4).  If you look at 
the CRAN test logs, the only platform on which RQuantLib is being 
installed is 32-bit Windows (not even Debian on which it is developed) 
-- and that is because the author supplied a pre-compiled Windows 
version of QuantLib.

I suspect you seriously underestimate the work which goes into 
providing R binary packages.  I know (I used to do it on Windows and 
still contribute there) just how thankless (literally and 
metaphorically) it is.

Hello Professor Ripley,

I see.  Yes, I failed to compile it myself on my CentOS machine
subsequent to sending this email also.  Very kind of you to get back
to me on this point.  I will see if I can get access to a Windows
machine and failing that, I will see about compiling QuantLib myself.
If I am successful I will remit this to the list.

Best,

Kyle

The package is in the Ubuntu repos and it seems to work. I have just installed it on my Ubuntu 10.04 in VirtualBox under MacOS 10.6 so it might be a solution.

If a package depends on external software it is built only if a) there is some demand for it and b) the dependencies can be built into self-contained static libraries with reasonably moderate effort. 

Now, since a) has been satisfied by this e-mail I was able to compile QuantLib and it is now available on the CRAN machine, but as Brian pointed out RQuantLib doesn't even pass its own checks, so despite our efforts there will be no binary. If you still want to build it despite it failing its own checks, you can get the QuantLib binary from
http://r.research.att.com/libs/
(beware, it's huge) and put the "boost" directory (containing the headers) from the Boost source distribution in /usr/local/include and you'll be able to compile RQuantLib for yourself.

Cheers,
Simon

Go to R for Mac OS X - developer's page at http://r.research.att.com/
Section Other binaries and tools   and then /libs/  ==>  http://r.research.att.com/libs/
You'll find fftw there in required architectures.

If this doesn't work, you'll have to wait for the experts.

Thanks for sharing with us that you forgot to install Tcl/Tk - not that we really need to know that. Did you mean to ask some question perhaps?

Ooops - my apologies - I missed that the output actually included some comment inside - it looked like a plain R output. It seems you're missing X11 - please read the FAQ on how to install it.

No. As I indicated below, X11 is running.

But which X11? Not Apple's  since the message says it's not present:

Depending on your OS version you should see something like:

Fino:~$ ls -l /usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.6.dylib

Did you install the gfortran from the Tools webpage of R for mac os x developer page, 
http://r.research.att.com/tools/
If not, install gfortran-42-5659.pkg first.

Hi Andreas,

So far as I can tell, the latest version that is available is
0.2.11-1, is that your understanding?  We are version 0.3.2 and per:

http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RQuantLib/RQuantLib.pdf

there have been some significant upgrades in the intervening releases.
 It seems that Professor Ripley is correct in that the newest version
is only available for Windows.

Thanks for the idea.

Best,

Kyle

Hi Simon,

Thanks, as always, for your hard work on the behalf of mac users.  For
now, I only need to run a quick few things, but if it happens that I
will need to be using this package on a more continuous basis, I will
get in touch about hammering it into shape on linux and OS X.

Best,

Kyle

Final update: The problem of R hanging when I tried to attach tcltk was fixed by reinstalling R2.11.1. Thanks, Simon, for your diagnosis of my X11 problem.

   I second this; this command-E issue has been driving me nuts since  
I use command-E in other apps all the time.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Hang with help link to pdf overview file
Message-ID: <F734110A-4AF0-40D3-A98C-F06BB4CA4962@comcast.net>

A post to r-help today prompted me to see if I could reproduce the  
problems the poster was having with a hang as a result of access to a  
pdf vignette for package zoo. I was not able to get a hang with using  
(from the GUI):
vignette("zoo")
but I was able to get a hang when access the zoo help Index and  
choosing the "overview" link at the top of the help browser page. The  
OP was using R 2.11.1, while I was using R 2.10.1. We both were using  
OSX 10.5.8.

I then updated to yesterdays stable  R 2.11.1 from the ATT page and  
can still get the segfault, although it no longer hangs. It lets me  
exit gracefully and even lets me copy portions of the console window:

 > ?zoo
starting httpd help server ... done

  *** caught segfault ***
address 0x101e90000, cause 'memory not mapped'

Possible actions:
1: abort (with core dump, if enabled)
2: normal R exit
3: exit R without saving workspace
4: exit R saving workspace

Do you have any Adobe plugins installed? They are known to be buggy and crash at times. The standard OS X pdf viewers work just fine.

In case you have no plugins - can you, please, describe in detail how to reproduce the issue? (GUI/ command line, exact version) I was following your steps in the GUI [R.app GUI 1.34 (5589) i386-apple-darwin9.8.0] and it was working just fine on 10.6.3 (I don't have access to 10.5 at the moment).

Thanks,
Simon

Message-ID: <FE196474-2313-4B5A-8EB0-1453335BD6C8@comcast.net>

Dear MacRs;

I have been having this problem for a while, but thought that when I  
updated to 2.11.1 that it might get fixed, but just did that and it  
persists. When I use plotmath functions, I see little empty boxes  
where I should be seeing theta's and phi's:

require(graphics)  # the first plotmath example
x <- seq(-4, 4, len = 101)
y <- cbind(sin(x), cos(x))
matplot(x, y, type = "l", xaxt = "n",
         main = expression(paste(plain(sin) * phi, "  and  ",
                                 plain(cos) * phi)),
         ylab = expression("sin" * phi, "cos" * phi), # only 1st is  
taken
         xlab = expression(paste("Phase Angle ", phi)),
         col.main = "blue")
axis(1, at = c(-pi, -pi/2, 0, pi/2, pi),
      labels = expression(-pi, -pi/2, 0, pi/2, pi))
# -- no phi's or pi's or warnings ---

How do I identify which library should be replaced or repaired or  
added to my PATH or which option set?

Have searched archives and FAQs, but maybe I'm not using same terms or  
understanding what I am being told.

David,

which graphics device and which OS are you talking about? For Quartz it is the Symbol font that is used (if I remember correctly) - please check your Font Book and make sure it's not disabled.

Cheers,
Simon

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] newbie macuser questions

I have a shiny new MacBook Pro, but am a total Mac-newbie.  I downloaded 
and installed R 2.11.1, Xtools,
the R Mac developer tools (for building packages).  I'd like to use 
eclipse/StatET/subclipse subversion to build my packages
and sync with R-Forge as I do on Win.  I read the R-Mac-FAQ, but the 
following questions remain, for now:

* I'm not sure whether to choose the 32-bit or 64-bit R.app as my 
main/default R.
* Are R packages installed separately for 32- and 64-bit or all together?
* Similarly, for eclipse, should I work with the 32-bit or 64-bit R?

* Rprofile: Under linux, I would put this at ~/.Rprofile; on Win, I keep 
it in the 'start-in' directory, c:\R.
Where should it go on Mac so it is always found?

thanks
-Michael

I am on 10.5.8 using the default Quartz screen device. When I followed  
your advice I found that there were two listings for Symbol/Regular  
and that one of them was displaying a blank page within Font Book.app.  
I remove that one, restarted R (after getting pages full of warnings  
in my first re-test) and now I am seeing Greeks again. Somehow a blank  
Symbol font got installed/corrupted or something. Thanks.

Don't know. Couldn't get them to play together nicely on my machine.

If you use medium-sized files ( 1-10GB is the definition I read  
recently) you will need 64-bit. If you work only with smaller files,  
it may not matter, and could even be marginally faster to stick with  
32-bit.

All together.

You set your startup directory in R/Preferences/Startup. The default  
setting is your user home directory, ~/     # at least in Terminal- 
speak. In (GUI)Finder.app, it is a little house symbol on the LHS of a  
Finder window.

Your .Rprofile goes wherever that home directory is. By default the  
dot-files are not visible in the Finder.app but it is very easy to  
find instruction on haw to change that behavior with a Google search.  
The default text editor TextEdit.app will allow you to create  
dot.files (unlike any of the default Windows editors as of my last use  
several years ago).

Best of luck.

FWIW, I've had this combo working just fine previously ... I'm
guessing it should still be fine to have this working now. I'm not
using Eclipse much these days, though.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] dblepr for 64B R
Message-ID: <05101D5A-07FA-4E2C-BABE-D827CF409C2A@uiuc.edu>

I'm trying to understand why 64B R produces an insane answer/plot
to the first

	example(crq)

in my quantreg package, whereas 32B R produces a sane answer
with the same data.  This involves some fortran and in my usual
primitive fashion I've been trying to debug with fortran printing
using the tried and true call dblepr.  However, in my test function
call dblepr prints  values like 
z
[1] 1.644287e-313

even though the function returns the sane, correct values.  Is this
a known issue, and if so is there an alternative strategy for
printing from fortran in 64b R?

TIA for any enlightenment.
Roger

PS.  In the hope that someone will tell me that all would be well

PPS.  The fact that I can run 32B R on the same machine by simply
typing R --arch i386  is one of the great advances of modern science
in my opinion, or at least I thought so, until I discovered this discrepancy
in what was being computed by the two versions.

Hi,

I am starting to use Xcode a lot for C/C++ programming.

Can you do R programming in Xcode? ?If can, how to configure to enable this?

Much thank in advance.

Do you mean doing the R level stuff in Xcode, or just the C or C++ parts 
of packages?  The latter is possible, and it is useful when debugging 
low level stuff.  I don't think it is possible to get Xcode to work with 
the R interpreter (but I would love to hear that I'm wrong).

I think it would be easier to integrate R's debugging facilities into 
Emacs than into Xcode, but I don't think anyone has done it yet.

Hi David,

Thanks, but this picture is exactly what I was getting in 64B.....   
and it is entirely bogus.
Fortunately, this morning I discovered that ddot in fortran needs to  
be declared double
in 64B, but apparently doesn't in 32B... and this resolves the  
problem.  I've submitted
an updated version of quantreg to CRAN that fixes the problem.   The  
dblepr was just
an intermediate debugging issue, and was entirely my stupidity.  It  
works exactly
as it should once variables are declared double.  Why ddot behaves  
differently in 64B
vs 32B is still mysterious to me, but so are many aspects of ordinary  
life, so I have
resolved not to question further.

Dear "R team",

I am a regular user of R as a social scientist, and since last friday 
for the first time I've been facing serious problems using R on a Mac 
computer.

I couldn't launch anymore R, it was cashing before it could open. I've 
searched on the internet to find solutions to my problem. In the first 
instance, it was useful, I realised that the file "history.txt" was the 
cause of the crash 
(http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/RMacOSX-FAQ.html#R_002eapp-GUI-crashes-on-startup_0021). 

So, I removed it and R worked again until... this morning.

I am facing the same problem again, although I can't identify anymore 
the reason of the crash. This is not caused by "history.txt" file, nor 
by "workspace.rdata". I've reinstalled several times the R application 
(the lastest one, ie. 2.11.1 as well as an older version 2.8.1) but this 
doesn't change anything.

I don't know what to do, therefore I email you to ask you if you could 
help me.

I've attached a "R crash report" that may help you, but it was generated 
by my computer, not by R (I couldn't find a R crash.log).

I hope this can help you.

Many thanks in advance,

Best wishes,

Neither "history.txt" nor "workspace.rdata" are typical sites of  
corrupted workspaces. The default workspace is a "dot file", i.e. one  
whose name begins with a <dot> (= "."), named ".Rdata". These files  
are not visible in the Finder unless you change the behavior to show  
them. There are many sets of instructions for doing this that will  
come up on a Google search. The other method would be to open a  
Terminal window and:

rm ~/.Rdata

I do not think that corrupted history files are quite so common a  
cause, but getting rid of the default history file could be done in a  
Terminal session with:

rm ~/.Rhistory

Another possible culprit is ~/.Rprofile.
Once this was the source of my problem.
A tactic to help isolate the problem is to run

R --vanilla

from the terminal.  Then you can paste in lines from .Rprofile
one at a time, until you encounter the trouble.

Good luck.

That's normally a symptom of setting the margins too small to hold the 
text, or (equivalently) the text too big to fit in the margins.  Take a 
look at par(), in particular see if you've changed the default values


$cex.axis
[1] 1

$mar
[1] 5.1 4.1 4.1 2.1

If you haven't changed those, then it looks like a font problem:  R 
thinks your default font is too big to fit.  The default font is 
determined by the par() setting

$font.axis
[1] 1

as well as defaults specific to your graphics device.  I don't have my 
Mac here, so I can't tell you what the default font is supposed to be on 
your Mac.

Please check your fonts (Applications -> Font Book) and make sure Arial and Helvetica are not disabled or corrupted (those are the defaults - if you changed your font settings in R check the corresponding fonts).

Dear R-Mac people,

I am using R on a Mac, and would need the lme4 package. I saw on the 
help-list that it has been unavailable for reasons I do not understand. 
Is there  a chance that lme4 will be available soon again for the Mac?

thanks for your help,

Hi Gisela,

 	You can probably install it from source if you have Xcode
installed...you can download Xcode from Apple for free at
http://developer.apple.com/technologies/xcode.html .

 	Then, try _install.packages("lme4", type="source")_. If that doesn't
work for whatever reason, you can either wait for the binary to appear or
install an earlier version.

FWIW, R-Forge has binary packages for "lme4".  I've just installed mine from the command-line with

	install.packages("lme4", repos="http://R-Forge.R-project.org")

and at least basic lmer() calls seem to work fine.

Best,
Stefan

It fails "make check". CRAN is not distributing binaries of packages that fail checks since it may deliver incorrect results. You can still install it from sources install.packages("lme4",type='source') if you want to use it anyway (see R for Mac FAQ for the necessary tools).

They will be available when lme4 is fixed to pass the checks. Given that the issue is there for over a year I would not hold my breath.

Hi,

 	I tried to install the source version of Rcpp under 64-bit R 2.11.1,
which I had compiled myself under OS 10.6.4.  The install.packages() run
failed, however, with this error:

...libintl could not be found. Well, shoot--I have that. It's in /sw/lib.
So, I tried setting LDFLAGS, I tried setting
--configure-vars="LDFLAGS=-L/sw/lib", I tried setting configure-args the
same way, I added /sw/lib to my LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment
variable...pretty much everything, but when I install.packages() the above
command does not change even though it is clearly linking.

I would also note that LDFLAGS=-L/sw/lib is actually included in my call to
./configure when building R in the first place...so my hand-compiled version
of R should well know where to look for libraries.

So my question to the list: Is there some specific way to make R pass the
correct flags to the compiler in this case?  I can't figure one out.

(I also note that if I download the source, unarchive it, and tweak the
makefile to hard-code -L/sw/lib into the path, the package installs just
fine and works...so the problem is in how install.packages() is working.)

So, could someone please explain to me how to get R CMD INSTALL or
install.packages() on OSX to add linker flags that I would like to specify? 
Or if this is a problem with R in general, or a problem with Rcpp in
general, please kindly let me know. I doubt that I am the only person having
this trouble.

Cordially,
Adam Kramer

Adam,

the correct way to specify custom linking flags is via PKG_LIBS so try that (more comments inline).

That is clear - LD_LIBRARY_PATH has no effect on OS X and the package has no configure script so there is no point in trying to set configure-vars ;).

Your'e asking for trouble with that. Although it is unrelated to your issue if you have fink setup R's configure will pick it up automatically so better stick to that.

It is well documented in R-exts section 1.2.1.


Just for completeness (not related to your case), packages with configure scripts should respect the usual autoconf settings such as CFLAGS, LIBS etc. and pass them to Makevars as PKG_LIBS etc., but there are some that are badly written and don't.

Simon,

 	Many thanks, as always! It was actually a bit trickier since I run R
as root and then install.packages(). So this is what I needed:

sudo PKG_LIBS=-L/sw/lib R

...and then I could install.packages("Rcpp").

...I'm sure you knew that, but I'm in favor of posting solutions to mailing
lists. Additional replies inline.

Yep, this is just an instance of me trying everything I could think of.

I compile R myself, I don't use fink for it. But yes, my setup is
nonstandard.

To be clear, I'm trying to _install_ an extension, not write one. :) That is
why I could not find this result, most likely.

Right. Rcpp is using "Makevars" and not a configure script, and is required
for lme4a, which I'm just dying to try out...that's dying for other reasons,
but I'll probably ask on the R-sig-mixed-effects list before coming back
here.

Thanks again,

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Return key often ignored
Message-ID: <0F049665-D21F-4CFB-AC43-28A189340FD8@sticksoftware.com>

   Hi all.  A bug that is driving me a bit batty (R 2.11.1 GUI 1.34  
Leopard build 32-bit (5589)): the return key is often ignored in the  
editor window.  This seems to happen particularly often when you have  
just clicked onto a line of code.  You hit return and start typing,  
and your typing ends up on the same line.  I have not found a  
consistent way to reproduce the bug, but it happens to me every minute  
or two, so it seems pretty reproducible.

   Apologies if this is not the right way to report a bug, I'm new  
here...
