 ????? Thanks to Jeff Newmiller for his reply.? He was correct.? My 
Bitdefender internet security automatically upgraded itself and started 
blocking R in ways it had not before.? Please excuse me for taking the 
time of this list with this issue (and for my delay in sending this 
"issue resolution" email).

I am glad my response helped direct you toward a resolution, but antivirus interference did not actually occur to me. Thanks for reporting back.

Message-ID: <6688e3f2-5abc-92d1-d83d-0b638bb548c7@thon.love>

hi,

i've successfully built R for macOS, and it all works well, however i'm 
wanting to achieve compatibility with the prebuilt .tgz CRAN R packages.

the compatibility issue i've been having is that the R produced lacks 
the Resources/lib/libc++.1.dylib. the prebuilt CRAN R packages link to 
this, and can't find it at runtime.

i'm wondering where this file (and a few other files in Resources/lib) 
that ship with the official CRAN R binary come from - because i don't 
think they're from the build process of R.

it looks like the official binary is subject to a few additional build 
steps (copying binaries in, etc.)?

with thanks

jonathon

Jonathon,

when you build R it requires the compiler runtime libraries from /usr/local. We don't want to require users to install compilers just to run R, so we supply copies of those runtime libraries in the lib directory.
You can replicate the way CRAN R is built using the CRAN build scripts in https://svn.r-project.org/R-dev-web/trunk/QA/Simon/R-build

There is a lot going on and there are many special cases for all the compiler generations we were using over the years, but I think the main part to look at for what you refer to is
https://svn.r-project.org/R-dev-web/trunk/QA/Simon/R-build/fixpathR

Cheers,
Simon

hi simon,

it's been interesting looking at all your install_name_tool patching ... 
i've been doing something very similar with jamovi (and jasp before 
that), where we ship an embedded version of R inside the app bundle. in 
my case, i have to patch all the paths to be relative (i.e. 
@executable_path/../.. etc). because the user can put an app bundle at 
any path.

one thing that you do with the macOS R, is bundle the libc++.1.dylib and 
the libc++abi.1.dylib from /usr/lib ... but i don't think this is 
necessary. the strategy i've taken is to copy every dependency *except* 
those from /usr/lib ... my projects would have user bases in the 10's of 
thousands, if not 100's of thousands, and it hasn't been a problem so far.

are you sure you need to bundle the libc++ and libc++abi .dylibs?

kind regards

jonathon

Hi All,

just to check whether I am the only one (or one of the lucky few) who randomly get the message (I posted it before but we did not seem to find a solution then):

Hi,

Based upon a reply by Simon to your query last April:

  https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-mac/2019-April/012972.html

while I do not have a definite response, you might try the following:

1. Check your ~/.Rprofile to see what if any settings or packages are defined at startup. You might rename the file to something else so that it does not get used, and see if the message persists. If not, then there may be something in that file that you may need to identify through trial and error.

2. Re-install XQuartz, which should done after each R update, to see if there is something related to that.

3. You might consider fully deleting R, all installed packages and R.app, and doing a clean install. The issue you had last April was with 3.6.0, so it is possible that something was corrupted and persists with 3.6.2. A prior post from you in March of last year with the same issue was with 3.5.3, so whatever was happening goes back a bit.


Not sure if that will get you anywhere, or are perhaps things that you have already tried, but some initial thoughts.

Regards,

Marc Schwartz

I do not have a .Rprofile, just .Rhistory, .Rapp.history and a directory .R with my Makewars

does not make any difference

This seems a bit drastic and I would not have the time for a while, I was hoping for a more benign fix (especially if the problem reappears).

This is great! Thank you for sharing. I think I noticed a bug with the fixpathR script: clang4 complier is hard coded.

https://svn.r-project.org/R-dev-web/trunk/QA/Simon/R-build/fixpathR

Instances:

    find . -name \*.dylib -or -name \*.so| xargs -n 1 install_name_tool -change /usr/local/clang4/lib/$gcclib $R/lib/$gcclib

and

	install_name_tool -change /usr/local/clang4/lib/$gcclib $R/lib/$gcclib $rbin

Could this be the reason for the ABI issues we're having with clang7?

Best,

JJB

    when you build R it requires the compiler runtime libraries from /usr/local. We don't want to require users to install compilers just to run R, so we supply copies of those runtime libraries in the lib directory.

JJB,

no, there are many different paths which apply for different compilers used in the past. Note that the line you are referring to is a -change command so it only applies if that entry is present in the binary, so it will only affect clang4, not the currently used compilers. The current compilers use ${TC_BASE} which is derived form the toolchains file:
https://svn.r-project.org/R-dev-web/trunk/QA/Simon/R-build/toolchains

Cheers,
Simon

Message-ID: <f97a2e9d-daef-a685-edf9-c205e9ca03c5@prodsyse.com>

Hello:


 ????? How can I find the version of "bash" and "mv" that are used by "R 
CMD check" under macOS 10.15.2 Catalina?


 ????? I ask, because my "Bitdefender for Mac" has been interrupting "R 
CMD check" for a couple of years now, saying, "Bitdefender Safe Files 
blocked a new process, bash, from accessing your protected files."? Each 
time it happens, Bitdefender allows me to tell it to "Remember this 
action:? For 5 minutes" or "For this time only" or to "Keep blocking".? 
Their "Safe Files" feature allows me to give access to certain 
applications.? I've already "allowed" 36 different applications using 
that feature, including "/bin/bash", "/bin/mv", 
"/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.6/Resources/exec/R", and two 
different versions of "git".? I'm not sure, but I believe that "R CMD 
check" uses versions of "bash" and "mv" different from "/bin/bash" and 
"/bin/mv".


 ??? ? Thanks,
 ??? ? Spencer Graves

R does not ship bash or bin with the program distribution on macOS. It
uses the ones that come along for the ride with the system (which will
be interesting when Apple removes bash completely in 10.16).

If you've used MacPorts or Homebrew, you may have installed version of
those shells/tools there which R is picking up.

This:

    sapply(c("bash", "mv"), Sys.which)

should tell you where R is picking up those binaries.

As a minor note, Sys.which is vectorized, so
    Sys.which(c("bash", "mv"))
will do.

 ????? Thanks.


 ????? It answers the question I asked, but sadly doesn't solve the 
problem.

Dear All,

I've recently acquired a new MacBook, and while transferring my files and
settings I noticed something I did not expect:

Old Mac:
> set.seed(12)
> sample(letters[1:10])
 [1] "a" "h" "i" "b" "g" "j" "e" "f" "d" "c"


New Mac:
> set.seed(12)
> sample(letters[1:10])
 [1] "b" "g" "c" "f" "e" "i" "d" "j" "h" "a"

For numbers I don't see anything different, the examples from ?set.seed
producing the same results. Both R versions are the same (3.6.2) and both
computers run macOS Catalina 10.15.2.

I would be grateful for any advice,
Adrian

That's the effect of RNGkind(sample.kind="Rejection") which is the new default. Unfortunately, the older and buggy "Rounding" has a tendency to linger in saved workspaces.

Dear Peter,

Thanks, it's good to know there is a good explanation for this and also the
sample.kind is now more stable.
Curiously though, I run the very same R version on both computers and I
would have expected RNGkind() to work the same.

Best,

The most likely explanation is that on one machine you had (like I did)

Yes, that was it.
And easily solved with:

RNGversion(?3.6.2?)

hi,

in case no-one had noticed yet, the following links are broken:

http://mac.r-project.org/src/

http://mac.r-project.org/libs/

as linked from:

https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools/

earlier today, the SSL on mac.r-project.org was broken too, but that 
appears to be working now.

cheers

Yes, they are on a plane to New Zealand... (more or less, anyway)

Expect things to get tidied up during next week.

Jonathon,

the content is there and /libs was working to my best knowledge, but /src was relying on automatic index which was disabled for the mac.R-project.org site - it should work now. Also SSL was not configured yet for that domain, but is now.

If you see issues, please, send me an e-mail - I was gradually moving content from the old server, but the DNS setup was a bit complex as we tried to orchestrate the movement of between three different servers.

FWIW the build machine has now arrived in Auckland unharmed and I kick-started the build (R nightlies should be up already), but the staging of builds and results may still require some work.

Thanks,
Simon

They appear functional. Have you checked recently?

FWIW I've started a daily mirror process (mirror URL =
https://rud.is/rmac/mac.r-project.org/) and also setup certificate &
uptime monitoring for the main site so there'll be a bit more advance
notice in the future.

I need to add a couple checks for this particular situation (to the
mirroring to avoid it clobberin the mirror) but it'll be a backup in a
pinch.

ARGH. It also looks like a standard wget mirroring + rewrite command
isn't dealing with everything, but /src/ and /libs/ are both intact.
I'll tweak the process this week so everything gets covered.

Bob,
the machine actually has rsyncd since that is how CRAN mirrors it - that is probably a more sane way if you want to keep a copy. I'll send you details later.
Cheers,
Simon

Hello everybody,

 

I am new at this Mailinglist and I have a question about R on MacOS Catalina.

On your Website I had found a package for R. If I want to install it on my MacBook ? the program told me, that I can?t install the software

on an other volume like ?system??.. That is bad, because I had a small Volume on my MacBook ?

 

If I want to compile the R-System new with GNU-C Compiler 9.2.0 ? I can ?make? the files, but ?make install? return it with an ERROR.

So, did you have any ideas what kind of problems that here I had?

 

I thank you very much for your assistance and have a nice day?..

Matthias,

A Mac with Catalina and a small hard disk?

I use the Homebrew package manager and while there is a short delay
between R and Homebrew this works out very well.  It has two options,
one with out the app, which is what I use because I for GUI I use
RStudio exclusively.

There is really no need to compile from source :-)-O XCode is huge, 
though the XCode command line tools are required.

Gruss aus dem S?den :-)-O

Eberhard,

thank you so much for your quick response. 

Yes, my MacBook has only 256 GB HDD (Standard) ?
Oh, well, I know & I don?t use X-Code as well. I take the small version of that: xcode-select --install
(It installed only the command-line tools, header, etc. for using their own c-compiler)

Hm, I never used "Homebrew" - I come from the UNIX - World and I like the command-line ?.
Well, I can create the files for R via "make" - after them it breaks the installation ?

Best regards....

Homebrew is Linux-style packaging for OS X. Think of it as an equivalent to
apt-get?either it will retrieve a binary or it will attempt to build one.

Matthias,

this is exactly why you should use Homebrew.

For me it usually had to resort to the latter when there were
connectivity issues (more common in Namibia than in Potsdam :-)-O).

And maybe once or twice when I wanted to try something special.

It also has a 'cask' option with which it installs apps so I do

brew install r
brew cask install rstudio


All in all rock solid.

Thank you so much for you assistance.

My problem is not solved, because I must install R, etc. on a different Volume like SYS-Volume & I can?t find this option under "homebrew".....

First of all 256 Gig is huge, as far as Homebrew is concerned. I have had homebrew installed
even on very old systems with no more than that.

Secondly, drag the sucker over to the iStore or Gravis and have them bang a proper SSD in. Been there, done that.

Or, thirdly, install minimal Homebrew and then look under /usr/local and /opt, what it uses, move them to another Volume and symlink/mount them accordingly.

Why is this so complicated? Not unfamiliar says the German in me. But then I am only an elderly Gynecologist not doing high performance computing.

If you say Debian, Fink is more appropriate.  Fink uses apt-get and .deb format.  One good thing is Fink allows you to install multiple versions of R.

Why not use the official installer and adjust the installation path?

https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/

Also allows multiple versions being installed, all from the CLI (but I
guess guess it's a normal desktop machine and you can just use the gui
installer).

256GB is a normal size for a disk, don't see the problem. 90% of all macs
probably don't have more.

Homebrew R differs slightly from the official R installer and might cause
problems in some cases.

 ????? I haven't followed this entire thread, but I'm running macOS 
10.15.2 Catalina on a 2014 MacBookPro, and I haven't had problems 
downloading the latest version of R.? Roughly a month ago, I clicked 
"R-3.6.2.pkg" on "https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/macosx/".? It 
downloaded to my "Downloads" directory.? Then I double-clicked on it, 
and it opened.? I can't remember, but I may have had to click and drag 
the icon to the "Applications" folder.? And I may have had to enter my 
password to assure macOS that it was OK to run that application.? I may 
have had problems with this a few years ago, but I haven't had a problem 
recently.? However, I may misunderstand your question.

Patrick,

thank you so much for your help /answer.

But the ?official? R on this WebSite doesn?t allow to install the software on an other Volume (I wrote that in my first eMail).

 

YES, 256 GB is a lot for a MAC, but if you have less than 50% free of your harddisk, the system goes slow, because it is a SSD ? HardDrive???

So it is better to install the software on an other HardDisk /Volume?.. and it is faster ?

 

HomeBrew is nice, that?s right, but I don?t want to install that.

For me it usually had to resort to the latter when there were connectivity issues (more common in Namibia than in Potsdam :-)-O).

And maybe once or twice when I wanted to try something special.

It also has a 'cask' option with which it installs apps so I do

brew install r
brew cask install rstudio


All in all rock solid.

Matthias,

CRAN R and all packages rely on absolute paths to the framework - that's why we don't allow any other location. However, the is nothing preventing you from moving it elsewhere and using a symlink. So your best bet is to install it and then move
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework
anywhere you want and create a symlink from there to the new location. If you don't even have enough space for a temporary install, you can use the tar balls provided at http://mac.r-project.org/ and unpack them on your secondary volume and create symlinks yourself. In that case, you will likely also want to create a symlink from /usr/local/bin/R to Resources/bin/R inside the framework - this is normally done by the installer script. FWIW, you can see the full postinstall script which is run by the installer here:
https://svn.r-project.org/R-dev-web/trunk/QA/Simon/R-build/packaging/leopard/scripts/postflight

In theory, you can also just symlink /Library/Frameworks and then install - I have not tested that but it should also work.

Cheers,
Simon
