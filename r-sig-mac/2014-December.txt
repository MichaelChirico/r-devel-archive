Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] X11 and Yosemite
Message-ID: <CAKL8G3Gfgg9=X4yTP7L35_f=xet8Mk4b478jpRtXEujNDDtY3Q@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I recently updated my OS to Yosemite (v 10.10.1)

I installed XQuartz from http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/ and
followed the suggestion at
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26489928/cant-load-x11-in-r-after-os-x-yosemite-upgrade
 However, when I tried

R> plot(rnorm(10))

the following error shows up:

Error in (function (display = "", width, height, pointsize, gamma, bg,  :
  X11 module cannot be loaded
In addition: Warning message:
In (function (display = "", width, height, pointsize, gamma, bg,  :
  unable to load shared object
'/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/modules//R_X11.so':
  dlopen(/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/modules//R_X11.so, 6):
Library not loaded: /usr/local/lib/libcairo.2.dylib
  Referenced from:
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/modules//R_X11.so
  Reason: image not found

When I looked at /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/modules/ I could
actually see the R_X11.so file in there.   The X11.app is located at
/Applications/Utilities and runs with no problems when initialised.

Could somebody please point me in the right direction to solve this?
Below is my sessionInfo() and output from capabilities().

Thank you very much for your time.

Jorge Velez

First, please make sure you upgrade at least to R 3.1.2 since pervious version are not fully Yosemite-compatible.

Second, the hack you're mentioning is not necessary if you installed the correct R version, so make sure you have downloaded the Mavericks/Yosemite build.

Third, please check that you don't have 3rd-party libraries installed that would conflict with R or XQuartz. R itself doesn't link to libcairo.2.dylib, so that missing dependency likely comes from some 3rd party library that gets loaded instead of the correct ones. If in doubt, rename /usr/local to something else to verify if erroneous libraries there are breaking your system.

Cheers,
Simon

Message-ID: <75A8DEE6-652F-47F8-8DE5-17E16018E983@utoronto.ca>

I've recently been getting freezes while editing a script file and noticed on this list that the current R version is 3.1.2 (I was on 3.1.1). "Check for updates" had reported R 3.1.1 as being up to date. I downloaded the package from CRAN via the Web interface and it installed without a problem. I'll follow up on the freezes if necessary, for now I just wanted to report this anomaly of the updater, in case it's not a user error on my side.

Cheers,
Boris

For a couple of days I have been seeing a (system generated) warning after I open a document, when I change focus into that document:
  2014-12-04 15:05:21.336 R[73463:707] *** 
  WARNING: Method convertPointFromBase: in class NSView is deprecated on 10.7

This occurs also if the document is empty, however not with a document that has been freshly created in a new session.

As well, I have experienced freezes (application not responding) right after R displays the segfault message, while
editing the script file. The freezes are intermittent, after about an hour of coding or so - I can't reproduce them
yet.

Updating to 3.1.2 has solved neither of the problems.

Is this a known problem? Is there anything I can contribute to get it solved?
Thanks!
Boris

It's a warning. A programming paradigm used in older versions of OS X fell from favor in version 10.7. We still maintain a Snow Leopard (i.e. OS X 10.6) build. The question is whether the intended paradigm replacement actually works in 10.6; otherwise, it could be undesirable to maintain two different codes for the two different builds.

I don't see the warning as related to any segfault? Being able to continue work following a segfault would be quite unusual so I suspect that you're using the term incorrectly.

If you want to contribute, you might dig into the source code for R.app and figure out what it is that needs to be replaced and by what. And then whether the "what" is present in the Snow Leopard toolchain. The closest I can get is stuff like this:

http://oleb.net/blog/2011/08/whats-new-for-developers-in-lion-part-2/

Mind you, Simon might already know all about this and just needs to get around to sorting things out.

Ah - sorry if this was unclear:
I don't know if the warning is related to the segfault. I just started noticing both at about the same time.
When the segfault occurs, R is frozen. The console displays an options dialogue for shutting it down, but accepts no input.

With several more freezes today a pattern seems to emerge: once I have edited for a while, the freeze happens when I select a part of a line of code.

If it helps, a colleague of mine and I also get the freezing + segfaults a
few times a day. They also occur while typing into the code editor in R.app
[both of us are using R version 3.1.2 (2014-10-31); Platform:
x86_64-apple-darwin13.4.0 (64-bit) ].

They seem to be more frequent while trying to use command+z (undo) several
times in a row. Maybe some thread is scanning/parsing the file after each
change and it can't keep up with rapid undo?

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] XPCErrorDescription
Message-ID: <CAMLNaBZw65VdWnDpQkc5MUBVcqnoZMgHV3QjfW3SDnF_Qi_=tw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there,

I keep getting error messages like this one:

2014-12-04 21:26:39.155 R[50233:30990798] Communications error:
<OS_xpc_error: <error: 0x7fff752fcb60> { count = 1, contents =
"XPCErrorDescription" => <string: 0x7fff752fcfa8> { length = 22, contents =
"Connection interrupted" }
}>


Any suggestions?

I'm running R 3.1.2 on Mavericks.

thanks!

John

"Check for updates" had reported R 3.1.1 as being up to date. I downloaded the package from CRAN via the Web interface and it installed without a problem. I'll follow up on the freezes if necessary, for now I just wanted to report this anomaly of the updater, in case it's not a user error on my side.

Thanks, I forgot to bump the version in the file on CRAN that defines the current version. Done now.

Thanks,
Simon

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] OpenFile Dialog hangs
Message-ID: <54971DBF.9030602@witthoft.com>

This just started out of the blue:  If I select, say, "Open Recent" and 
pick a file from the list, the file opens just fine.

But if I select "Open,"  then the dialog box opens, but the file list 
never gets filled in, I get the spinning beach ball, and never recover.

I took the precaution of turning off DefaultFolder; same problem.

I can execute "SaveAs" without any problem.

I am running Yosemite 10.10.1, R 3.1.2, and as I said up until 2 hours 
ago all was just fine.    I even rebooted the machine and reinstalled R; 
no change.

The entire "hang" file (from /Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports) is huge so 
here's the top portion. PLease let me know if there is some specific 
section that could help diagnose this problem . -- or if someone would 
like me to email the zipped file.

thanks
Carl

From carl at witthoft.com  Sun Dec 21 20:48:14 2014
From: carl at witthoft.com (Carl Witthoft)
Date: Sun, 21 Dec 2014 14:48:14 -0500
Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] OpenFile hang; fixed not solved
Message-ID: <549723FE.3090306@witthoft.com>

Pursuant to my last post:

I tracked down and deleted all the following support files, all of which 
are in  "~/Library/Preferences"

org.R-project.R copy.plist
org.R-project.R.LSSharedFileList.plist
org.R-project.R.plist
org.R-project.R.savedState

R now works correctly.  I don't know which of these files was corrupted, 
so if anyone has some suggestions as to the forensic studies :-) I could 
do, I'd appreciate it.

In any case, I'm functional again.

Carl

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] corrupted plist file again
Message-ID: <5499851B.70802@witthoft.com>

Hi,
I got the same corruption problem again that causes a spinning beachball 
hang when I try to open a file via the "Open" dialog window.

This time I traced it down to a specific plist file, and have posted the 
bad file to my GitHub account:

https://github.com/cellocgw/Rgoodies/blob/master/BADorg.R-project.R.LSSharedFileList.plist

If someone could take a look and see what happened to that file (or if a 
"bad" file name somehow is causing the problem, e.g.), I'd be very greatful.

thanks
Carl

Carl,

I cannot replicate it even with your file. "Hang" in open dialog are typically caused by the system - e.g. waiting for disks mounted etc. - R is simply waiting for the system (LS/Finder) to gather information about all disks. I suspect you may be accessing some disk (virtual or real) that has issues. The plist only has recent files, so I don't think it's directly involved - the only thing I can think of is that it may be directing the UI to the bad location. Is there anything you can think of that would cause volume access issues on your system? (network mounts, virutal disks, etc.)

Cheers,
Simon

Hmm... The reason I suspected the file is that every time I delete this 
plist file, everything is OK again. However:

Other than some mystery "Shared" volume called "8e402800000" which my 
OSX desktop tells me "connection failed," I don't have any oddball 
mounts.   I'm unable to collect any info on that volume, and I can't 
eject, unmount, or connect to it, so I dunno what it is, but it is true 
that when I run "GetInfo", the FinderInfo window goes into a spin while 
"Fetching more info" so possibly that is the headache.

Any idea how I can remove that alleged volume from my Network list?  It 
doesn't show up as ejectable.

Terminal % ls -a /Volumes doesn't show any other entries,btw.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] apparently solved: hang on Open Dialog box
Message-ID: <5499E8F1.2030404@witthoft.com>


I think I've solved the problem.  I have been using FinderPop for ages 
sans problems, but the R.app-specific problem described previously went 
away as soon as I added R.app to the list of excluded applications for 
FinderPop.

Dunno why this is, but hardly worth asking anyone to dive into the R.app 
source code (or FinderPop ) to fix.

Thanks to Simon for running some tests at his end.

Carl

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Is Yosemite now "safe" for most of us?
Message-ID: <CAHkxROagVVk2hYvSZziayFKr+-VmMSBFGk1gm72fbBwKK1Mvrg@mail.gmail.com>

The missives about running R/Rstudio under Yosemite seem to have died down.

For the vast majority of us who are "vanilla" uses of the current versions
of R and Rstudio, is Yosemite (10.10.current) now as safe as Mavericks
(10.9.current)?

I'm hoping a single short response from one of the R-on-Mac leaders will
give me (and thousands more) either a green or red light at this point.

Thanks for all the great work you do.

Yes, the bugs have been well and truly worked out.

Worked around, more precisely.

There are still bugs in Yosemite's handling of environment variables, 
and R >= 3.1.2 has workarounds that resolve some of those.  But they can 
still bite when building R or installing packages.

I have found that

unsetenv FOO
setenv FOO value

resolved the issues I had.  (csh syntax, works in bash too.)

If you upgrade to Yosemite, do ensure that you have read the current 
R-admin manual and re-install the software it recommends.  We have found 
that what needed to be reinstalled varied between nominally identical 
systems ...

Also notice that Yosemite itself still has issues that were not or were only partially resolved in 10.10.1. I currently see

Peter-Dalgaards-MacBook-Air-2:BUILD pd$ 

which is better than 10.10.0 where I was up to -26 at some point, but the upgrade apparently  didn't resolve this (machine detecting itself as another machine) completely.

Rather more infuriating is that the UI is laggy, in particular, Finder can get so slow that it becomes nigh-on impossible to scroll to and select a simple file. I'm sure Brian would be (is being?) driven nuts by inertia of the zoom feature. Periodic reboots help, but this is supposed to be Unix...

And Firefox still doesn't speak Java - it detects the plugin, then claims that it is missing when you go to a page that uses it. Fortunately, the two sites that I needed it for have both switched to Javascript.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] tcltk
Message-ID: <549C3821.7090507@univ-reims.fr>

Dear useRs,

I have just upgraded to R 3.1.2 for MacOS 10.6.8 (with the binary for 
Snow Leopard).

Everything is fine except that I get an error when loading TclTk:
 >library(tcltk)
Error : .onLoad a ?chou? dans loadNamespace() pour 'tcltk', d?tails :
   appel : system2("otool", c("-L", shQuote(DLL)), stdout = TRUE)
   erreur : erreur lors de l'ex?cution d'une commande
Erreur : le chargement du package ou de l'espace de noms a ?chou? pour 
?tcltk?
sh: otool: command not found

What could be wrong? If needed I can translate the error. I had no 
problem with R 3.1.1.

Thanks in advance and Merry Christmas!
Ivan

Yes, there is still quite a list of issues with Yosemite itself (Java, Mail, ...) - although we have covered most known issues on the R side, I wouldn't call Yosemite itself a stable OS yet. If you don't have to upgrade (family sharing and other new features) then I wouldn't recommend it at this point.

Cheers,
Simon

Most recent tcltk is trying to detect the source of Tcl/Tk using otool to make sure all necessary libraries are present. However, older system don't have otool installed by default so this will fail if you don't have Xcode installed which provides otool. It seems that this is the case on your machine, installing Xcode command line tools should fix the issue.

Cheers,
Simon

Thank you Simon for your answer.
But I cannot find Xcode for MacOS 10.6...
And by the way, why did it work with R3.1.1?

Go to

https://developer.apple.com/downloads

and search for Xcode 4.2

or use

https://developer.apple.com/devcenter/download.action?path=/Developer_Tools/xcode_4.2_with_ios_5_sdk/xcode_4.2_and_ios_5_sdk_for_snow_leopard.dmg

Because this check is new in R 3.1.2. I think we may modify the check to not fail if otool is not installed.

Cheers,
Simon

am having problems installing the Package packfor form source in Mac OS X
Yosemite in the R software. I know that the package depends on fortran

affect anything. Bellow I am reproducing the error log.

please if anyone has any advice on this would be much appreciated.

Thanks in advance
