Subject: netCDF driver missing from package terra 1.6.7 for Mac
Package terra 1.6.7 for Mac (x86_64 version) does not have the netCDF driver.
I have checked with Robert Hijmans who confirms that this important driver is present in the Windows build, but missing from the Mac build.

Could the package be built again to include the netCDF driver?

Many thanks,

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Cannot open PDF Vignettes on Ventura
Message-ID: <40434E1C-9B9D-41AE-BE1B-B3BC57EF607F@utoronto.ca>

I noticed today that I can no longer open PDF vignettes from the help system in Ventura. I first noticed it in RStudio. Previously PDFs would open in Preview but now they try to open in a web page. So, I tried in native R (outside RStudio). I started the help system and went to the survival package vignettes and tried to open one. I eventually got a Finder window with the message, "AdobePDFViewer cannot find a compatible Adobe Acrobat or Adobe Reader to view this PDF. Please select one.? At the top of it.

Besides Preview I do also have Adobe Acrobat Reader installed (but it is not set as the default viewer for PDFs).

Additionally, the following error appeared in the Console when I tried to view a PDF vignette (for the sake of reproducibility I tried to load the survival.pdf vignette).

2023-02-06 11:10:56.198 R[52961:4981916] CFURLResourceIsReachable failed because it was passed a URL which has no scheme

Has anyone else encountered this?

Kevin,

this looks like a problem with your Adobe installation - you seem to have the stub installed, but not an actual Adobe viewer. Perhaps look for uninstallation instructions for Adobe, reinstall it or ask their support? After upgrades it is often necessary to re-install 3rd party software.

Cheers,
Simon

Thanks for the reply Simon.

As near as I can tell I have a working Adobe reader. I checked for updates and have the current version, it is just not set as my default viewer for PDF. Why has it stopped working with the Mac Preview app? Is it related to the loss of PS/EPS support?

I would prefer not to have to set Adobe Reader as my default. I could try removing and re-installing and see what happens.

Kevin

I removed and re-installed Acrobat Reader. The error persists. I even let Reader be my default for PDFs and still no success.

Kevin,

no this is an Adobe issue - it seems to hijack the PDF support. R simply uses "open" so it doesn't care who handles it - that is a system setting, it has nothing to do with R. Did you try setting Preview as your system viewer?

Cheers,
Simon

Simon,

Preview is my default viewer. In the finder window that came up I tried selecting Preview as the viewer to use and it still failed. The following errors went to the Console.

Hi Kevin.

If you just run `open some.pdf` in a terminal, does it open properly in 
Preview?

Kevin,

can you then describe in more detail what you are taking about? If you open a PDF vignette in R, it simply calls "open" so it will open in Preview (as that is your system viewer). And you have confirmed that it is what happens, so are you taking about something else? If so, please describe every step you make to reproduce whatever issue you are having.

Thanks,
Simon

When I try to open a PDF vignette (say a vignette from the survival package)from the help system in R it does not open Preview. I cannot actually open any PDF vignettes. All I get is a finder window with the error I previously described. It asks me to select an appropriate viewer. Selecting Preview opens nothing and more errors are thrown to the Console. I could send you and Duncan screenshots off-list, since I know that theses lists are picky about attachments.

The steps I take are:

1. Open the R app.
2. Start the Help system.
3. Navigate to the survival package vignettes.
4. Click the PDF link for the The survival package

Then the errors happen.

I will send a screenshot of the result off list.

Kevin

I don't have Ventura installed (I'm still on Monterey 12.6.3), and 
following the procedure you describe I get similar results.

On the other hand, if I choose Help | Vignettes I get a preview
in the R.app vignette window, then if I double click on it, it opens in 
Acrobat reader (which is the default PDF viewer on my system).

Kevin,

oh, that's something entirely different - what I was talking about was if you use
vignette("survival")
in R it opens a Preview with the vignette.

What you describe seems like a browser plugin issue, because the help system is just an html page (assuming you are talking about the html help system). So it seems that you may have installed some Adobe browser plugin that doesn't work anymore. The plugins live in ~/Library/Internet\ Plug-Ins/ (user) and /Library/Internet\ Plug-Ins/ (global), so you should remove it from there.

Cheers,
Simon

That worked for me.  I deleted two plugins from the global 
/Library/Internet\ Plug-Ins folder named

  AdobePDFViewer.plugin
  AdobePDFViewerNPAPI.plugin

and dated from 2020.  Now things are fine.

So it seems that you may have installed some Adobe browser plugin that doesn't work anymore. The plugins live in ~/Library/Internet\ Plug-Ins/ (user) and /Library/Internet\ Plug-Ins/ (global), so you should remove it from there.

Thanks Simon and Duncan.

I found the same plugins and removed them. It works correctly in the R.app.

RStudio still directs me to a browser window at the localhost address 127.0.0.1 and nothing loads. I know RStudio is not R and this list is for R so will probably have to search elsewhere for that solution unless anyone here happens to have an idea.

The problem seems to be with the Electron framework they switched to in the current version. 

>From https://dailies.rstudio.com/version/2022.07.1+554.pro3/ the previous version works, but not the Electron version. For those that are interested Electron is a newer framework that has the advantage of being completely free, and is what is now used by RStudio rather than Qt.

An ?interesting? aside is that in Monterey (12.6.2), a blank window
appears when I click on ?PDF? from within the RStudio help system.
Within the R GUI, there is not a problem.  In either case, typing
  vignette('concordance', package='survival?)
in the command line window works fine.  Kevin, does this work
for you?

Thanks for that Ken.

I downloaded the ?non-Electron? version from the link you posted and PDFs now open properly. Naturally, RStudio now wants to update but I assume an update will fetch the broken Electron version.

Thanks for all the help troubleshooting.

So it seems that you may have installed some Adobe browser plugin that doesn't work anymore. The plugins live in ~/Library/Internet\ Plug-Ins/ (user) and /Library/Internet\ Plug-Ins/ (global), so you should remove it from there.

Hi,

Just as an FYI, without getting too far OT, if you are not familiar with Electron (https://www.electronjs.org), beyond being "free", it is cross-platform (Windows, macOS, and Linux), which is why a notable number of application developers, including "for profit" ones, are shifting to it. You can get a sense for that here:

??https://www.electronjs.org/apps
? ?
That being said, as with most such things, there are pros and cons to using that framework, in the latter case, notably the material memory overhead and that you lose the OS specific UI/UX as apps take on a more generic web-like esthetic across each platform. Some have also raised security issues with the framework.

I don't use RStudio, but it sounds like there is bug with RStudio's new version, which should be reported to them. It looks like they are in the midst of some structural changes to their web site given the recent corporate change from RStudio to Posit, but here is a link to the current community support page:

??https://community.rstudio.com

Regards,

Marc Schwartz

Thanks Marc.

I have now confirmed that this is not a MAC only issue. Tested on my windows box just now.

Thanks again to everyone who helped.

So it seems that you may have installed some Adobe browser plugin that doesn't work anymore. The plugins live in ~/Library/Internet\ Plug-Ins/ (user) and /Library/Internet\ Plug-Ins/ (global), so you should remove it from there.

All I get is a finder window with the error I previously described. It asks me to select an appropriate viewer. Selecting Preview opens nothing and more errors are thrown to the Console. I could send you and Duncan screenshots off-list, since I know that theses lists are picky about attachments.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Ventura users: do not install R from the Downloads
 folder
Message-ID: <B169DDEF-5227-463A-8F0E-D4E93F65E43B@R-project.org>

Apparently there is a bug in Ventura that prevents software installation from the Downloads folder. Once the installer package is moved someplace else - the home or Desktop - it works. So if you see "Installation failed", make sure you move the package (typically that would be the R-4.2.2-arm64.pkg file) out of the Downloads folder. (Thanks to Max for sending the installer log so we could trace the cause!).

Cheers,
Simon

MacOS Ventura 13.1 on MacBook Pro 2020: if the "Downloads" folder is not in the list of enabled folder for the Installer, then it asks you to add it and installation works. It will fail only if the folder is in the list AND it has been disabled (grey toggle). Which is quite understandable.

Christofer,

yes, unfortunately this is a known bug in macOS Ventura affecting a lot of command-line programs that use GUI. Do not upgrade to Ventura (usually a good advice given the long list of known bugs in Ventura) or wait for a fix from Apple.

Cheers,
Simon

For some reason, R's sessionInfo() is reporting that I am running Big Sur.

Not sure why R is reporting wrong. Thanks,

What may be important is that you are running R 4.2.1 which was replaced by 4.2.2 on 31 October 2022, and may know a lot more about Ventura.

Also if you are on Ventura it would probably be best to make sure that you are upgraded to 13.2 which hopefully has a lot of the bugs fixed.

Pretty use R does disinguish MacOS versions:

> sessionInfo()
R version 4.2.2 (2022-10-31)
Platform: aarch64-apple-darwin20 (64-bit)
Running under: macOS Ventura 13.2

for me.  So if one is on Ventura but R thinks it is running on a different OS, that?s a starting point right there.

Please do read ?sessionInfo

      Where R was compiled under macOS 10.x (as the CRAN Intel
      distributions have been) but running under ?Big Sur? or later,
      macOS reports itself as ?10.16? (which R recognizes as ?Big Sur
      ...?) and not ?11.x? or later.

This is only an issue on Intel binary distributions: the arm64 ones are 
built on macOS 11.

'macOS Big Sur ...' is not 'wrong'.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] macOS may not give R much time in a long compute
Message-ID: <3c807554-97df-277f-4361-3abadd16b6a3@prodsyse.com>

Hello:


	  During a long compute (in a while loop), I've asked R to report 
progress via:
	

# Progress report every 3 minutes
   et3i <- proc.time()-startT3i
   if(max(et3i)>180){
     startT3i <- proc.time()
     cat('iscan = ', iscan3, '; et3i = ',
         round(et3i[1:3]), '\n')
   }


	  When it's running properly, I get something like the following:


iscan =  22992 ; et3i =  180 26 104
	

	  However if I leave my computer running unattended, I can get reports 
like the following:


iscan =  32124 ; et3i =  22 1 180


	  Evidently, macOS 11.7.4 decided NOT to give time to R.


	  Suggestions?
	  Thanks,
	  Spencer Graves

Are you using R.app (you failed to say)?

If so, have you acted on the documentation about 'app nap'?  E.g. ?4.1 
of the R-admin manual.

	  I'm "using the newest version of RStudio" [Version 2022.12.0+353 
(2022.12.0+353)].  This means I am running R.app?

	  Thanks for the term "app nap" and the reference to ?4.1 of the 
R-admin manual.  I had not previously heard of "app nap", but that 
sounds like what I've encountered, and that section of the manual 
suggests that if I encounter this problem again, I can open a terminal 
and enter:


defaults write org.R-project.R NSAppSleepDisabled -bool YES


	  Will it take effect immediately?  Or will I need to restart R?


	  I've changed the code since I reported this problem, and I have not 
encountered this problem since.  I'm not sure, but when I noticed this 
problem, I may have had "if(max(et3i)>1800)" [progress report every 30 
minutes] instead of "if(max(et3i)>180)" [progress report every 3 
minutes].[*]  With luck, this change may fix this problem.  If yes, 
might you have any idea what the threshold might be?


	  Thanks very much.
	  Spencer Graves


[*] I'm not sure what threshold I was using when I encountered this 
problem:  180 or 1800 seconds.  I foolishly didn't save the output that 
included lines like the following:


iscan =  22992 ; et3i =  180 26 104


iscan =  32124 ; et3i =  22 1 180

No, it means you're not using R, so please ask RStudio support since that is not under R's control (since RStudio is a web server there are many ways how this could matter).

Cheers,

PS: that made me think - if R is embedded in another application we should probably include that information in sessionInfo() to avoid confusion of R with other tools.

Message-ID: <B512969A-46F8-4863-A7B9-A80F5749A8D8@northwestern.edu>

Dear R-Mac users.

In trying to speed up a large correlation problem (600K subjects, 6k variables,)  which I can do using my bigCor function, I decided it was time to learn how to use GPU on my Mac book with its M1 Max gpu.  

Having spent a day searching the web and trying  various approaches, I give up.

Are there any packages I can use to do calculations on the GPU part of my Mac using R?

Thanks.

Bill,

to answer the general part of you question, there are quite a few packages that allow you to use your GPU. At the low level you can use OpenCL which allows you to write code directly on the GPU and turn it into R functions. At a higher level there are frameworks like Torch and Tensorflow that support GPUs and there are packages like keras or rTorch that provide interfaces to that, e.g. for machine learning models. All those support Apple silicon GPUs.

However, you mentioned bigCor which is orthogonal to that. There are papers (such as https://doi.org/10.1134/S1995080219050068 ) that describe some approaches to using GPUs to compute covariance matrices, but in general GPUs don't really give you a large benefit on their own since it is a lot more about memory management and using smart algorithms/data structures to reduce the necessary computation. You may have more luck asking in HPC forums about that since is not really Mac-specifc (and the answer may depend on what you are actually trying to do so may need more details).

Cheers,
Simon

Simon,

That is very helpful.  Your advice about the memory management is what I do in bigCor to allow me to find covariances that would otherwise blow up.  It takes advantage of multiple cores that we have on Macs and allows me to solve problems that I could not handle directly.  I had the hope that some magic would help me in using the GPU to speed things up and I had just missed finding the approrpriate package.  From your note, I have not. 

Many of us R for Mac users are forever in your debt for your support of R for Macs.

This is very interesting, as I intend to buy an ARM Mac just because it has
a lot of GPUs to play with.
Quick question to Simon, who is also developing OpenCL, is there a C level
API to start kernel workers from the C level of my own package?
That would greatly extend the capabilities of my R package C code.

I second Bill's thanks for all your efforts,
Adrian

H Bill, 

I am not aware of any packages that do this for you directly. While it is certainly possible to write a Metal shader that will get the job done, it will likely take a substantial amount of non-trivial effort. To further complicate the issue Apple GPUs do not support double-precision computation (used by R). 

Maybe it would be possible for you to accelerate computation used Apple-provided routines from the Acceleration framework (e.g. BLAS and LAPACK)? Many of those routines have access to the hardware matrix accelerators present on Apple hardware and can result in major performance improvements. 

Best, 

Taras

Dear Taras et al.

I currently use

BLAS:   /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.2-arm64/Resources/lib/libRblas.0.dylib
LAPACK: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.2-arm64/Resources/lib/libRlapack.dylib

In the help page for R-mac developers it says:


The BLAS library used by R depends on the way R was compiled (see ?R Installation and Administration? manual for details). Current R binaries supplied from CRAN provide both vecLib-based BLAS and reference BLAS shipped with R. vecLib is a part of Apple?s Accelerate framework which provides an optimized BLAS implementation for Mac hardware. Although fast, it is not under our control and may possibly deliver inaccurate results.

The CRAN binary uses --enable-BLAS-shlib option and two Rblas shared libraries are supplied: libRblas.vecLib.dylib which uses vecLib BLAS and libRblas.0.dylib which uses reference BLAS from R. A symbolic link libRblas.dylib determines which one is used. Currently the default is to use the R BLAS: this is recommended for precision.

The statement: "Although fast, it is not under our control and may possibly deliver inaccurate results? worries me.  Should it?

My routines that are most matrix heavy are finding correlations, doing factor analysis using my fa function, and using the CFA function in Lavaan.  Accuracy in these results is important,

But spending several hours finding large correlation matrices has driven me to search for speed.


Bill

Dear Bill, 

I think this warning comes from a time when Apple?s implementation of these libraries were severely neglected. From what I understand, this is less of an issue today, as Apple has improved their efforts in this domain, even though some of the routines are still a bit outdated. And of course, this is still closed source, so it is unknown what kind of bugs or accuracy issues are there. 

Then again, using Apple?s Accelerate is pretty much the only way to officially access the numerical coprocessor. I?d recommend that you give it a try and validate it on some data you already have results for. Could be a nice boost in performance that you re looking for, could be a few wasted hours. One never knows :)

Best, 

Taras

Dear Taras et al.

I just tried the Apple Blas and the old BLAS.  The answers (at least for a 950x950 correlation matrix ) are identical, the speed difference is trivial.  My bigCor function does speed up the process compared to base R cor()  by a factor of 3-4, and also allows me to handle larger data sets.  The real difference in speed was switching from the Intel i9 chip to the Mac M1 Max chip.  In comparing older timings, this resulted in a 4x speed up.  

Thanks for the help. 

Bill

Your subject line is alarmist -- you only provide any evidence for 1 out 
of > 19000 CRAN packages (and not R itself).

Package RGtk2 was archived in 2021.  The current rattle (5.5.1) does not 
depend on it.  A direct download is available from rattle's CRAN landing 
page.  You have not told us what version of rattle you downloaded nor 
from where.

For me just now R 4.2.2 successfully downloaded

I should have said that rattle does not declare a *strict* dependency on 
RGtk2.  When I try to run rattle() I see

 > rattle()
Error in rattle() :
The RGtk2 package is not available but is required.
Please install the package using, for example:

   install.packages("RGtk2")

which would have failed.

Maybe you have some non-CRAN version of RGtk2 installed?

rattle's DESCRIPTION does say

   Note that RGtk2 and cairoDevice have been archived on CRAN.
   See <https://rattle.togaware.com> for installation instructions.

If you followed that, it would be something to take up with the 'rattle' 
maintainer.

Loading rattle seems to have worked -- it was running rattle() that failed.

As my goal was to coax a local Expeditionary HS Science teacher to use
Rattle , it was the only fraction of the suite which was germane. I thought
the title would be taken as a humorous nod to the classic *goto* paper. I'm
sorry it was found to be in suboptimal taste.

Is https://rattle.togaware.com/rattle-install-mac.html not the right place
to look? It had been a few years, but Togaware used to be the right
starting point. Also searching for installing Rattle on Mac
(unsurprisingly) delivered a ton of hits, many obviously stale, but some
not so obviously so. But pkg, devel, brew ... I am observing the same
behavior (errant environment variable?)

Step 0 Downloaded R https://cran.r-project.org

There were many different attempts at step 1, the seemingly most obvious
one from togaware has instructions from 2018, so I wasn't terribly
surprised that it failed. I was surprised at the *way* it failed

Step 1 install.packages('rattle')  # picked the TX mirror, as they are
physically reasonably close.
Even trying again with the  install.packages("
https://access.togaware.com/RGtk2_2.20.36.2.tgz", repos=NULL) before the
rattle install, it is offering to install GTK+, and installs the wrong one.

So, this claims to be 5.5.1, but it does insist on RGtk2, and I'm getting
the wrong RGtk2. Obviously there must be something in my environment that
differs from yours, or the TN repository is somehow wrong..

I tried installing on my system  - Intel iMac  OS 11.7.2  .

I followed a bunch of instructions from the togaware site, even playing 
with 'brew' to install stuff.
As stated by folks below,  rattle 5.5.1 still tries to get RGtk2 
rolling.  I also found that attempts to load the RGtk2 library as 
installed from togaware leads to inconsistent responses:

[ and notice also the apparent attempt of the 4.2 directory to reference 
a nonexistent 4.1 directory!  WTF???   ]

Rgames> library(RGtk2)
Error in dyn.load(file, DLLpath = DLLpath, ...) :
   unable to load shared object 
'/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.2/Resources/library/RGtk2/libs/RGtk2.so':

   Reason: image not found
Learn more about GTK+ at http://www.gtk.org
If the package still does not load, please ensure that GTK+ is installed 
and that it is on your PATH environment variable
IN ANY CASE, RESTART R BEFORE TRYING TO LOAD THE PACKAGE AGAIN
Warning message:
Failed to load RGtk2 dynamic library, attempting to install it.
Rgames> library(RGtk2)

# no error or response from this second try

And then if I try to start rattle up:

Rgames> rattle()
Error in .C("R_gtkInit", length(args), x = args, success = logical(1),  :
   "R_gtkInit" not available for .C() for package "RGtk2"


I spent rather too much time reading thru the help and support pages at 
togaware.com ; my conclusion is that rattle is abandonware.  Those pages 
clearly haven't been updated in over 5 years.  'brew' commands are 
deprecated, for example.

Thank you for your effort. If it is indeed abandoned, that is unfortunate.
It was a nice tool for introducing students to relatively advanced
