Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] problem with character encoding in file names in R 3.2

Hi,

I don?t quite know how to produce a repeatable example for you because the problem I have seems to be caused by folder names on my computer.

Yesterday I was still using R 3.1.2 and there was no problem with this issue. 

Today with R3.2 it does not.

Input = "../data/"
juvcodData = paste0(Input, "Donn?es respirom?trie SDA morues juv/? )  # the name of this folder contains accented vowels

a = 1:10folder1 = paste0(Input, "Donn?es respirom?trie SDA morues juv/")
folder2 = paste0(Input, "Donnees respirometrie SDA morues juv/")

a = 1:10
save(a, file="b?.Rda ?) #1
save(a, file=paste(Input, "b?.Rda ?)) #2
save(a, file=paste(folder1, "b?.Rda ?)) #3
save(a, file=paste(folder1, "be.Rda ?)) #4
save(a, file=paste(folder2, "b?.Rda ?)) #5
save(a, file=paste(folder2, "be.Rda ?)) #6


All files were saved with the name I expected, except for # 3: 
b? (Conflit li? au codage Unicode).Rda
with the bracket loosely translating to ? Conflict related/caused(?) to Unicode coding ? 

So if there is an accented vowel somewhere along the path already defined in R, and the name I want to give the file, the file name is so altered. If the is an accent only in one of the two, no problem. As I said, there was no such problem with R 3.1.2.

The problem is probably not due to R itself, as this works:
> paste0(folder1, "b?.Rda")
[1] "../data/Donn?es respirom?trie SDA morues juv/b?.Rda ?

But when R uses this string as a path name when saving a file, I get the problem above.

Thanks for any help or suggestion,

Denis

What you posted here doesn't have regular quotation marks.  I'm not sure
about the opening one, but the closing one has been converted to a
guillemet.  R would never have accepted this as input, so what you're
showing is is probably not what you actually did.

You also don't say exactly what happened, just that it didn't work.

Could you please post again, simplifying to just one string that fails,
and explain exactly how it fails?  I am sure that having save() call
paste() will not result in any difference from just calling paste() on
its own, and likewise manually typing the full string should produce the
same result as constructing it via paste().  (But I am not sure that
paste() is producing what you want.)

Thanks.

OK, good idea Duncan. 

All folders are in the working directory and I added one thing to your suggestion: I created 2 folders from outside R, with the OS, one with and one without accented vowels (?t? and ete). With the following script, I also create a second folder with accents, as you suggested. 

######
dir.create("b?b?") # folder created within working directory
# in addition, 2 folders already exist in this working directory, one with accents, "?t?", and one without, "ete"

a=1:10

# saving to 3 locations using a file name containing containing accents
save(a, file="b?b?/b?.Rda") #1 path with accented vowel created from within R
save(a, file="?t?/b?.Rda") #2 path with accented vowel created with the OS
save(a, file="ete/b?.Rda") #3 path without accented vowel created with the OS


# saving to 3 locations using a file name containing no accent
save(a, file="b?b?/be.Rda") #1 path with accented vowel created from within R
save(a, file="?t?/be.Rda") #2 path with accented vowel created with the OS
save(a, file="ete/be.Rda") #3 path without accented vowel created with the OS
######

Results: folders "b?b?" and "ete" both contain 2 files:
b?.Rda
be.Rda

But the folder "?t?" contains these 2 files:
b? (Conflit li? au codage Unicode).Rda
be.Rda

Note the extraneous string in the name of the file with the accented vowel. The only situation where the corruption of the file name occurs is when using a file name that has accents and a path created with the OS, not R, that also has accents.

Thanks, I'll see if I can reproduce this.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] loading issue with tkrplot on OS X Yosemite
Message-ID: <7B1788FBAB20CE42BE9043D4102A22213F836367@KLU-MAIL-01.KLU.klu>

Dear community,

I'd appreciate your help on the following issue with loading tkrplot on OS X Yosemite. Whenever I try to load the package RSA (which depends on tkrplot) or tkrplot directly, the session crashes, in R Studio and in R Console. All packages are up-to-date. XQuartz is running fine, as far as I can get. Any advice on how to solve this issue is highly welcome. Thank you.

Hey Branden,

This http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/149451/install-r-in-my-own-directory
has some basic steps, but the gist is to compile it from scratch (good
compile options in the homebrew recipe for R
https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-science/blob/master/r.rb ).

I'd highly suggest getting an admin-assisted install of official/base
R. It'll only be a couple of times a year for updates but worth it for
the stability factor. You can then have all package installs be
relative to your local dir.

But you'll still need the OS X dev tools installed for non-binary
packages that need compilation, so you should also probably get that
admin-assisted installed as well.

-Bob

Message-ID: <5C5D7CE0-AC0D-4122-8FD7-E851E1C606C1@noaa.gov>

Hi All:

I am trying to do a generalized SVD which is used in canonical variate analysis in System Identification routines.  I am running R 3.2 on Yosemite. When I do ?sos(?gsvd?) only a few routines show, up, one is in the package PEIP.  I have installed the package PEIP (from binary), and the error below should be reproducible because it is not a function of my data:

>  > junk<-GSVD(Yf,Yp)

>   dlopen(/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resourceslib/i386/libRlapack.dylib, 6): image not found

In the Mac installation, at least for R3.2, there is no /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resourceslib (there is a /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/lib) and even then there is no /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/lib/i386.

Any suggestions on getting PEIP to work, or an alternative to doing the gsvd, would be greatly appreciated.  The PEIP maintainer is on this email also.

Thanks for any help.

You may want to report to the maintainer - the GSVD sources have the following which is completely broken:

> GSVD
function (A, B) 
{
    SS = Sys.info()
    ssysname = SS[[1]]
    if (ssysname == "Linux") {
        lpath = paste(R.home(), "/lib/libRlapack.so", sep = "")
    }
    else {
        lpath = paste(R.home(), "lib/i386/libRlapack.dylib", 
            sep = "")
    }
[...]
    dyn.load(lpath)

It seems like the author failed to use the proper flags for linking LAPACK and then tried to hack around it in a horrible way that doesn't really work.

I suppose this happens when you don't even have a single test that a particular function works otherwise CRAN checks would not allow it in...

Cheers,
Simon

Correct.

And there is another issue with GSVD: it uses .Fortran to call the Lapack routine dggsvd with as.character(..) for the dggsvd 
Fortran character arguments. This is not guaranteed to work on all platforms.
I ran into this with my package geigen.

A solution is to write a wrapper around dggsvd in Fortran that accepts integer arguments for the JOB? options and converts these in the Fortran wrapper to the appropriate Lapack characters. You can then use a Makevars file to specify that your fortran code needs the Lapack library which would save you from the error prone method in PEIP.

And test your function that it works and is able to handle input errors.

I can only recommend using homebrew for installation of R (and
everything else you need). Works perfectly for me. Just be careful not
to mix up the official R packages and their dependencies (especially
fortran and tcltk) with the homebrew ones - I started with the official
ones and moved gradually to a full homebrew setup - and it is much
easier to maintain for me. I did not have as many probles on the swithch
to Yosemite as the uers of the official R version.

In a nutshell: go for homebrew and you might even not have to change
anything and it will install under /usr/local/ as a normal user -
homebrew does not need root access for most programs.

Cheers,

Rainer

Look in package geigen how to write a Fortran wrapper and use Makevars.
It?s not difficult.

You should check the Lapack included in R to see if it contains dggsvd.
If not you?ll have to include dggsvd.f and dependencies from Lapack in your package.

I checked the source of R-3.1.3 and R-3.2.0 and dggsvd is included in the R sources:  src/modules/lapack/dlapack.f
which means  if I?m correct that you may assume it is always available.

Hi,

I am trying to build this package from source:

https://github.com/timothyfrasier/related

I cannot do it because I have gfortran-4.9 (from hombrew?s gcc49 --enable-fortran) and 

/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.2/Resources/etc/Makeconf

lists 

 etc/Makeconf.  Generated from Makeconf.in by configure.
#
# ${R_HOME}/etc/Makeconf
#
# R was configured using the following call
# (not including env. vars and site configuration)
# configure  'CC=clang' 'CXX=clang++' 'OBJC=clang' 'F77=gfortran-4.8' 'FC=gfortran-4.8' 'CFLAGS=-Wall -mtune=core2 -g -O2' 'CXXFLAGS=-Wall -mtune=core2 -g -O2' 'OBJCFLAGS=-Wall -mtune=core2 -g -O2' 'FCFLAGS=-Wall -g -O2' 'F77FLAGS=-Wall -g -O2' '--with-system-zlib' '--enable-memory-profiling' 'CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include -I/usr/local/include/freetype2 -I/opt/X11/include' '--x-libraries=/opt/X11/lib?
?

I always create a symlink to the gfortran-4.9 binary so it reads ?gfortran?, for ease of deployment.

Can I edit Makeconfig so that it reads:

 etc/Makeconf.  Generated from Makeconf.in by configure.
#
# ${R_HOME}/etc/Makeconf
#
# R was configured using the following call
# (not including env. vars and site configuration)
# configure  'CC=clang' 'CXX=clang++' 'OBJC=clang' 'F77=gfortran' 'FC=gfortran? <?*change to gfortran*

and be done with it?  will it break everything/anything/bite me in the ass at some point?

Best

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] How to get a Fortran compiler compatible to Xcode?
Message-ID: <CAM3-Kjaxg4NWqH0Q1AwY9XVHxxsAUTHjmsGMOkdGYxLO45QBAA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm running Mac OS X Yosemite 10.10.3 on a MacBook Pro (Retina,
13", 2015). I would like to install R from source (various
versions etc.) and thus installed Xcode (latest version:
6.3.1). How can I get a Fortran compiler which is compatible with Xcode 6.3.1?

Here is what I tried:
1) I used to download and install gfortran-lion-5666-3.pkg from
http://r.research.att.com/tools but I now obtain "... can't be
installed on this disk. This package requires Xcode 4.1 with
gcc-4.2 (build 5666.3)". It seems that my (newer) Xcode version
is not recognized.
2) I then installed gfortran-4.2.3.dmg from CRAN -> Download R
for (Mac) OS X -> tools. This worked fine, but then I ran into this issue:
I wanted to install MPI and thus downloaded and unpacked
openmpi-1.8.5.tar.gz from http://www.open-mpi.org/software/ompi/
but ./configure leads to an error:

...
checking if C and Fortran are link compatible... no
**********************************************************************
It appears that your Fortran compiler is unable to link against
object files created by your C compiler.  This typically indicates
one of a few possibilities:

  - A conflict between CFLAGS and FCFLAGS
  - A problem with your compiler installation(s)
  - Different default build options between compilers (e.g., C
    building for 32 bit and Fortran building for 64 bit)
  - Incompatible compilers

Such problems can usually be solved by picking compatible compilers
and/or CFLAGS and FCFLAGS.  More information (including exactly what
command was given to the compilers and what error resulted when the
commands were executed) is available in the config.log file in this
directory.

I found this post
(http://grokbase.com/t/r/r-sig-mac/14awnd0341/compiling-r-3-1-1-sources-under-os-x-yosemite)
which seems to be related, but since there are no clear
instructions/scripts given, I still don't have a solution.

How can I get a suitable/compatible Fortran compiler?

Thanks & cheers,
Marius

I think you already have one, you just need to set flags properly - the typical problem is that, with default settings, you get C compiled for 64 bits and Fortran for 32 bit. 

I have this:

$ more config.site
r_arch=${r_arch:=x86_64}
CC="gcc -arch $r_arch"
CXX="g++ -arch $r_arch"
F77="gfortran -arch $r_arch"
FC="gfortran -arch $r_arch"
OBJC="gcc -arch $r_arch"
with_blas="-framework vecLib"
with_lapack=yes
CURL_CONFIG=/usr/bin/curl-config

Notice also, that with the newer sources, you need to install some stuff from http://r.research.att.com/libs/ : pcre, xz, texinfo, plus maybe some more that I have forgotten.

Dear Peter,

Thanks for your quick help.

I'm not so familiar with the technicalities (and try to learn): Where
is the file 'config.site' located in your system? Is this supposed to
be a file which provides settings for 'configure'?

Thanks & cheers,
Marius

PS: Also thanks for the hint towards r.research... I'll look into that
once everything else is running. I already have some things running,
e.g., texinfo, not sure if the 'texinfo' you mentioned is a specific
one (but I'll see then).

You do need to read this:

People are not inclined to write significant amounts of the same information to the list...

Hi Marius,

I've had success compiling (the latest versions of) R from source
using Apple's command line tools (shipped with Xcode), alongside
gfortran 4.8.2 installed from here (as hosted by Simon Urbanek):

    http://r.research.att.com/libs/gfortran-4.8.2-darwin13.tar.bz2

Alternatively, (and what I tend to do by default on OS X), you can get
the latest release of `gfortran` using one of the custom Apple
'package managers', e.g. with homebrew (http://brew.sh/), you can use

    brew install gcc

which will get you an up-to-date copy of `gcc` (not really needed
since you'll have Apple clang), but also `gfortran` (which is needed
as it's no longer shipped with the Apple command line tools).

After this, as long as `gfortran` is on your PATH (e.g. by symlinking
the binary into /usr/local/bin), you should be good to go for building
R from source -- it will then be able to automatically discover where
the Fortran libraries live, and so on.

Hi Kevin,

Thanks a lot for helping. That pushed me on the right track. I then
needed some more tools (Java/XQuartz) and could then install R from
source. Only make pdf; make info failed, saying that 'texi2any'
couldn't be found on the system. I couldn't find any hints online or
in the R administration manual on how to install/get it. I do have
texi2pdf, though. Do you know how to get texi2any?  (hope this is
still fine to be discussed in this thread, if not, I can open a new
one).

Thanks & cheers,
Marius

This is where you look for add-ons
     http://r.research.att.com/libs
<http://r.research.att.com/libs/gfortran-4.8.2-darwin13.tar.bz2>
for OS X.

For texi2any I would install a new version of MacTex.

Finally, see the R-admin manual.

Best,
Kasper

`texi2any` is packaged as part of `texinfo` (note that this is
documented throughout R-admin), and the latest version is available
for download (hosted by Simon Urbanek) at:

    http://r.research.att.com/libs/texinfo-5.2-darwin10.tar.gz

Or, if you're using homebrew, just use

    brew install texinfo

Hi,

Thanks again, Kevin.

@Kasper: I had a new version (as of today) of MacTeX installed and
texinfo came with it. I had texi2dvi, texi2pdf... but not texi2any,
that's why I thought it's something 'special' and couldn't find it
anywhere else.

@Kevin: I tried homebrew, but it seemed to fail, saying that it won't
link/install as texinfo is already installed (via MacTeX) :-(.
Interestingly, /usr/local/Cellar/texinfo existed afterwards and it
contained ./5.2/bin/texi2any. I then simply linked from /usr/local/bin
to that file, but still obtained (also after a reboot + as su):

sklar-2:R-3.2.0_build mhofert$ make info
ERROR: 'texi2any' v5.1 or later needed but missing on your system.
make[2]: *** [R-FAQ.info] Error 1
make[1]: *** [info] Error 2
make: [info] Error 2 (ignored)
sklar-2:R-3.2.0_build mhofert$ texi2any --version
texi2any (GNU texinfo) 5.2

yeah, I forgot.

Do what Kevin says, grab the texinfo from the r.research.att.com/libs
website.  Basically this is the first place to look.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] replace in the editor crash my machine.
Message-ID: <4939B404-8FD5-496A-8CB5-CF0AF1E2CC71@uv.es>

Hi,
Very simple replacements like 5 by 6, in R.app editor, freeze my machine (only one of them) consistently.
Any ideas what is misconfigured in that particular machine?

Hi -
I consistently get a segfault error when I use the built-in editor with a dataframe:

This happens when the editor is invoked from the workspace browser, and then the window is closed.
Editing functions works fine, though.
Is this a known bug or maybe something in my system?
Thanks.

Hi,

I'm working under Mac OS X 10.10.3 and installed R from source (see
below for more information). Hen compiling a package I receive a
warning about UTF-8 not being available:

* checking package subdirectories ... OK
* checking R files for non-ASCII characters ... OK
* checking R files for syntax errors ... WARNING
Warning in Sys.setlocale("LC_CTYPE", "en_US.utf8") :
  OS reports request to set locale to "en_US.utf8" cannot be honored
* checking whether the package can be loaded ... OK
* checking whether the package can be loaded with stated dependencies ... OK
* checking whether the package can be unloaded cleanly ... OK

I don't know any place where I call Sys.setlocale() and if I set the
locale to "C" in .Rprofile, I still receive the same message (and the
R admin manual is not very detailed about this case)

How can I fix that? (Let me know if you need more information)

Below is the output of sessionInfo().

Thanks & cheers,
Marius

How? From homebrew or the standard R version? You may not have so far provided enough information with sessionInfo(). I would expect that you would need to provide a makefile and some other UNIXy stuff.

That is not "LC_ALL"

On my device:

Sys.getlocale()
[1] "en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/C/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8"


I honestly do not know if the capitalization is the "sticking point", which I admit may not be the correct use of that Shakespearean phrase. Perhaps it should be a "tipping point"?

en_US.utf8 doesn?t exist on OS X - the corresponding locale name there is en_US.UTF-8

You may want to set R_ENCODING_LOCALES to the values that are supported by your OS, this is what I?m using on the CRAN machine:

R_ENCODING_LOCALES="latin1=en_US.ISO8859-1:latin2=cs_CZ.ISO8859-2:UTF-8=en_US.UTF-8"

Cheers,
Simon

There is R.3.2.0.pkg,
http://r.research.att.com/bin/macosx/R-3.2.0.pkg
but you'll need to upgrade to Mavericks.

The nightly builds for SL are still available for the time being at
http://r.research.att.com/snowleopard/R-3.2-branch/R-3.2-branch-snowleopard-signed.pkg

Cheers,
Simon

Message-ID: <CADsJW9G+VSEhrVoD-MtJa0eDT1Xdd70R5MbEFmpkbYLRiEzq0g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All

Very sorry to bother you but I talked my Uni into getting me a MacBook so I
can help students with R. While I've been using unix, linux and windows for
about 25 years I haven't used a Mac before

I have access as a local administrator but not as root which is reserved
for ITS sysadmins. Could this be the problem why R.app crashes?

I get the same problem whether I try to run R-3.2.0, R-patched, and R-devel

R seems to run fine in terminal, RStudio and emacs ESS but not from R.app

After trying the three available binary packages, I compiled from source
but even as a local administrator I can't install it which makes me think
it is a permissions problem

Xcode 6.3.1, gfortran 4.9.2 although App Store suggested upgrading Xcode

Any hints would be greatfully appreciated. Thanks!

Peter

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] R.app crashes on Mac OSX 10.10.3

I?ve had issues with R.app crashing crashing upon starting, when I?ve
not used it for a while.  Usually, if I try a second time, it starts without
problem.  I do have admin privileges.  I?ve had occasional crashes
after using RStudio for a while, more common than my historical
experience of earlier releases.  Tonight though, when I tried R.app, 
there was no problem.

R version 3.2.0 Patched (2015-04-19 r68206)
Platform: x86_64-apple-darwin13.4.0 (64-bit)
Running under: OS X 10.10.3 (Yosemite)

Message-ID: <B3055815-D7A7-4540-B27A-E05049F9E8FE@brandenwilliams.com>

Greetings. I am getting a new mac procured through my company, and I am pretty sure I?m not going to have local administrator access to it. Is there a clean way to install R locally for one user, including all the packages that might be required, so that I don?t need admin access?

thx.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] failed compilation "ld: library not found for
	-lquadmath"
Message-ID: <CANLFJPoF7jNkgh=pnceq=yT7BSHif41pUh_U+yLfSCRbt2Setw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I've been unsuccessful in installing my own packages 'planar' and 'cda'
from source, since I updated my MacBook Pro to Yosemite. I have the latest
stable binary of R from CRAN, re-installed the latest Xcode via AppStore,
got gfortran from http://r.research.att.com/, and I still get a compilation
error. My guess is that I have inadvertently carried over an older version
of gcc from the previous OS, and R is looking for a different one. The
error message for planar goes like this,

R CMD INSTALL planar

?/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.2/Resources/library?

-------------------------

Indeed, the directory "/usr/local/lib/gcc/x86_64-apple-darwin13.0.0/4.8.2"
does not exist. The closest thing seems to be
"/usr/local/lib/gcc/i686-apple-darwin8",

> ls -R /usr/local/lib/gcc | tree
   |-------i686-apple-darwin8
   |---------4.2.3
   |-----------finclude
   |-----------x86_64
   |-------powerpc-apple-darwin8
   |---------4.2.3
   |-----------finclude
   |-----------ppc64

Could it be enough to set a few compilation flags to point R to the right
gcc libraries? (not sure how)

Best regards,

baptiste

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] failed compilation "ld: library not found for

Hi,

Not sure my previous message ever got through, in any case I've solved the
issue by installing a newer gfortran from
http://r.research.att.com/libs/gfortran-4.8.2-darwin13.tar.bz2
Note that the tools suggested at http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools/
are limited to version 4.2.3, while the link at
http://r.research.att.com/tools/ (also for 4.2.3) is dead.

Regards,

baptiste

Thank you for your kind remarks - I will do my best to
fix this hack.
I was not familiar Makevars/Lapack - a good example would be useful.

I will also provide example tests, no problem.
