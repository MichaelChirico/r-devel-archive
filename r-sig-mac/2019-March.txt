Roy,

thanks for the info, it is definitely against CRAN policies to install homebrew or anaconda (and so is to modify user's settings), so if you see that, please report it. Unfortunately, it's hard to detect automatically.

Thanks,
Simon

Personally  I consider that bad practice.  It may be more convenient but can lead to unexpected trouble down the line just because of issues like this.  I have also seen R and Julia packages install things under the covers using Homebrew. I also consider this bad practice, again because it can lead to conflicts that leave the user bewildered . (Homebrew installs is its own directory, but you must be careful about setting Paths, and path priority).   This was particularly true when building from source.

I recently spent a week in hell with conda-forge where different packages used the same library (by name) but the recipes installed different versions,  and they kept on crashing each other.

And as people have mentioned,  Anaconda has its own R environment,  which may or may not interfere with the standard R install. I check my .profile or .bash_profile after installs just in case.  If there is a setting I will need to use some software,  I move that to a separate file to be sourced when needed.  Since I have started doing that,  a lot of conflicts have disappeared.

Anaconda is a great product, I use it  for my Python work,  they actually ask you if you want them to modify the .profile, but people say yes without realizing the implications.  First time I installed it, I said yes but then looked at what was added to the file,  and realized that could cause conflicts.  But since it is so easy to copy that part to another file and then source it as needed,  you can keep things separate.  One of the main things is anything in /usr/bin and /usr/local/bin that had similar things in Anaconda were finding the Anaconda version.

I moved that code in .profile to a separate file.  When I want anaconda,  I just source the file.  Makes problems such as that described  much less likely.  If you are using iTerm2 or the like,  then you can easily have a tab with the Anaconda paths and the rest of the tabs the more "usual" paths.

Hi,

I just tried to install the R 3.5.3 macOS binary from CRAN.

The SHA hash matches what is on CRAN, but I get an unknown developer message when I try to install.

I get:

pkgutil --check-signature R-3.5.3.pkg
Package "R-3.5.3.pkg":
   Status: no signature


I rechecked the 3.5.2 binary and do not have the issue there.

Thanks,

Marc Schwartz

Try from the commandline

sudo spctl --master-disable

and then install the package

Hi,

I am aware of the workaround, both from the CLI and via System Preferences.

The question is more about confirming that the binary is valid and from a source that is trusted, which is the point of digitally signing binaries as a trusted Apple developer.

Thanks,

Marc

Marc,

thanks, I'm glad that at least someone pays attention and checks the signature ;). I'm surprised my machine didn't raise a flag - I did test the image locally from the master URL before releasing.

I have now updated the package to be signed, it is identical content, just signed. You can get is from the Mac master server https://mac.R-project.org/bin/macosx now and other CRAN servers will sync in due time.

Thanks,
Simon

Very, very, very bad idea - never ever do that unless you're really happy to infest your machine with nice viruses and ransomware.

Actually, the OS does that even if we don't pay attention, so apparently people just haven't gotten around to upgrade and we haven't had new Mac users installing 3.5.3 yet. (To a first approximation, that is - some will of course know how to bypass the signature check).

The version from mac.R-project.org installs fine. CRAN master still has the unsigned version (recognizable by an MD5 hash starting with fff) at this point.

Not Really.

I have been loading R binaries for almost 10 years from CRAN, if not
longer.  If the SHA is ok, I don't care about Apple's Nanny mechanism.

And, it still warns on the first run, whether you really want to run a
program downloaded from the Internet.

The correct statement wouldhave been, something like: "Be careful when
you do that and only load binaries from reputable sources such as CRAN"

I really, really, really do not understand, after almost 40 years of
doing this (sendmail anyone?), why Apple wants to make an automated
start of Postfix requiring the SIP to be disabled off of the Recovery
Boot for a simple change of the launch control files.

Marc,

the same is achieved by the hash published by CRAN.

Though, of course, if the developers have a developer account, there is
nothing wrong with using it and even less with reporting the lack of use
of it :-)-O

My point of objection was the disabling all checks in a blanket manner. Since this forum is read by many people, not everyone may realize the very harmful implications of that single command.
If you know what you're doing, that's fine, but then you also know that you can simply use Open and acknowledge that you want to install anyway which is much safer way that to disable all checks systemwide.

Same goes with SIP - for 99.99% of users it protects them and for a very good reason. If you need to modify system files, you better know what you're doing and take all the responsibility. There is also a very good reason why you need to go to Recovery to do that - it wouldn't make any sense otherwise ;).

Cheers,
Simon

I agree more or less with both of you in this take! 

I really appreciate Apple effort for keep users safe and this is one the reasons I'm choosing Apple. 

However, one not always can install signed software and that doesn't mean you are directly at risk. You just have to know what are you doing. 

Luckily even if you disabling Gatekeeper <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gatekeeper_(macOS)> you still get a warning every time you install something out of App Store of some place that isn't in the safe list. 

Warnings are great, but prohibitions can go south quickly. I think we can all remember the problems some Windows system got in the past by warning and asking for the password too much. Users finally logged as root to avoid the nuance, thus making the system insecure.

Hi Simon,

Thanks for following up. 

I presumed that this was a production issue of some nature, as you had established the pattern of digitally signing the binaries some time ago.

Thanks again!

Marc

Hello,


We have often found the R-devel binary on the following page:

https://r.research.att.com/


And we point our Bioconductor users to this page to download R-devel.  The report for 3-15 says R-devel is OK but there is no available download.  The download link has been missing since at least Monday.  Is it possible for this link to be available?

Lori,

thanks, there was a problem related to merging binaries from the various build machines. It should be fixed now. Please let me know if you see issues tomorrow after the next nightly build.

Thanks,
Simon

Package "R-3.5.3.pkg":
   Status: no signature

Is it possible to get 3.5.3 signed and replace the file on the download page?

Your note seems to have stalled somewhere. It arrived here today (the 19th).

Anyways, this was a temporary situation, the signed package should have reached all of CRAN by now:

pd$ pkgutil --check-signature ~/.Trash/R-3.5.3-2.pkg
Package "R-3.5.3-2.pkg":
   Status: signed by a certificate trusted by Mac OS X

Message-ID: <BN8PR18MB26904F9B122DF5617BEF87A8FA410@BN8PR18MB2690.namprd18.prod.outlook.com>

When installing littler using install.packages('littler'), I got below message:

 * new binary r installed in bin/ subdirectory                                        
 * consider adding a symbolic link from, e.g., /usr/local/bin                         
 * on OS X, you may have to name this 'lr' instead 

How can I create this symbolic link?  

Thanks,
Naresh

Please contact the package author.
My guess would be something like

system(paste("sudo ln -s",shQuote(system.file("bin","r",package="littler")),"/usr/local/bin/lr"))

Cheers,
Simon

I had separate correspondence with the author of this package, Dirk Eddelbuettel.  Dirk kindly updated the documentation of littler to include additional instructions on creating a symbolic link.

Now my installation of littler works.

Thanks Dirk,
Naresh

Message-ID: <3AA4494C-4C6A-42C1-8158-47649B424607@kuleuven.be>

Hi,

when I open R.app I get:

R[8280:59117] Failed to connect (separatorView) outlet from (NSView) to (NSTitlebarSeparatorView): missing setter or instance variable

I am on Mojave, 10.14.4, R version 3.5.3 (2019-03-11), R.app GUI 1.70 (7632) x86_64-apple-darwin15.6.0.

I would not even know what it might mean, and whether I need to be concerned, but I felt I should report it.

Cheers

Message-ID: <552D2AA6-A741-4230-9A15-6C26E770906E@noaa.gov>

I recently updated to Mojave and all of a sudden I was getting header not found errors when trying to compile packages.  I was pretty certain my Makevars files was correct,  as I had been compiling before the upgrade successfully,  and the compilers hadn't changed.

The following is in some of the docs,  but just in case it helps,  cause it took me awhile to find it,  after installing the Command Line Tools for Xcode,  you should run:

sudo installer -pkg \
/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages/macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10.14.pkg \
 -target /

and voila packages that had failed to compile just a few minutes ago compiled successfully.

Hope this helps someone.

-Roy
