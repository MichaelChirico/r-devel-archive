No, unless you send us more details. If it doesn't work then there  
must be some console output or crash log indicating why (see the  
console - in App/Utilities), please send us the output.

This is likely an issue with the `foreign' package. This is not Mac- 
specific, I have just checked and I get the same behavior on Linux  
(in UTF-8 locale, en_US.UTF-8 in my case).

Technically, yes, the resulting file is a valid UTF-8 file. I don't  
know whether SPSS supports it, though (and I cannot check that).

Ah, it's all clear - you should choose "Deployment" build style when  
building R.app. You have built R.app with "Development" style which  
uses Zero-link, hence object files are stored in the build directory  
and in your setup removing Mac-GUI removes them as well. "Deployment"  
and "Debug" styles don't use Zero-link therefore are are self- 
contained and that is probably what you want.

Moving the R session did not work, but deleting the R prefs. did.  I  
checked both the console log and crash log, but can't seem to find  
anything dated 2/206.  I can send over the entire R.crash.log, if you  
like, but I doubt it will do much good.

I'm trying to determine what's changed from my customized

now.

Error in dev.copy(device = function (filename = "Rplot%03d.png", width =
480,  :
	invalid graphics state

Get same result when using "quartz" device.

I'm sure my previous environment had /usr/local/lib/libpng
but I'm trying to keep this machine a little closer to
stock, attempting to use only what typical non-developer
useR  would have loaded. Is this missing libary causing
the problem?

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] R Console on Cocoa printing question
Message-ID: <20060207192649.GC1180@wuser170-sph.umnet.umich.edu>

I'm sorry to ask what must be such a newbie question, but I
can't find an answer online, nor can I figure it out for
myself.  When I use the printer icon on the R console to
save the R console to a pdf file, I get results like those
shown at http://mickmcquaid.com/example.pdf, the page is not
wide enough, so each page is divided into two pages, with
about a column of numbers on the second page.

I tried two strategies to deal with this.  One was to use
the Mac OS X print dialog, which offers some possibilities.
For instance, I can change the paper.  If I change it to
landscape, I get the same result because the margins don't
change, so the output only uses a small fraction of the
printed page.

This behavior led to the second strategy.  At the R command
line, I try to say things like
  options(width=55)
or
  options(papersize="landscape")
to affect the width of the output.  All these choices seem
to lead to output of exactly the same width---not on the
display, but in the resulting pdf.

Can anyone tell me how to overcome this or even the proper
keywords to google to figure it out?  I've looked through a
bunch of the R-sig-mac archives, and I've tried a few
keyword searches, but to no success so far.

Thanks for this suggestion.  The problem with changing the
font size is that, although it changes the displayed font
size on screen, it has no effect at all on the font size for
output using the printer icon on the R Console.  I can not
figure out where settings for that output are made.

Interestingly, any time I change the colors of fonts, that
information is carried over to the printout.  In fact, that
is one key reason why I want to save my sessions this way,
rather than cutting and pasting into a text editor.  Doing
it this way preserves the different color of what I say from
R's response.  It's easier to read with those two colors.

If only I could actually control either the font size or
margins or page layout, I could cut the number of pages of
printout in half and not cut off the last few characters of
every line.

Hello to all,
I've looked through the documents posted on the R-project homepage. 
However, I would like to read some more and concentrate more on the 
statistical aspect of R. Could you recommend further tutorials to be 
found on the net?
Thanks in advance.

I mean using and building statistical models for data analysis 
specifying the possibilities of variations appearing in R. An example 
would be specifying Split-plot ANOVA with both random and fixed 
factors.
A lot of the tutorials in above url try to explain R as a programming 
language and therefore cannot allow too many explanation. That is the 
case of "Jack of all trades... etc." R is useful for quite a lot of 
things, however I'm looking for something like a statistics course in 
R.
Just to prevent misunderstanding, I do own, and am familiar with, 
exhaustive statistical texts. So I don't exactly need a course in 
statistics.

Thanks in advance,

	Gil

For me, changing the font size on screen (using Command-+ for example)  DOES change the font size when previewing with the printer icon, or printing.

Hi Gil,
You can pretty much do anything in R, often in several ways,  
depending on your personal taste.
For Split-plot ANOVA with both random and fixed factors
you might start with

@book{Pinheiro2000,
	Address = {New York},
	Author = {J. Pinheiro and D. Bates},
	Publisher = {Springer},
	Title = {Mixed-effects {M}odels in {S} and {S}-{PLUS}},
	Year = {2000}}

Unfortunately, I have not found an online resource for R and
statistics as good as the book, Peter Dalgaard, Introductory
Stastistics with R, Springer, 2002.  It would be great to
have an online copy of this book.  It fills a niche for me
that no online tutorial does.  Luckily, it's quite small, so
carrying it around is less burdensome than most statistics
textbooks.  It is currently the textbook for Epidemiology
870, a graduate level course at the University of Michigan's
School of Public Health.

Someone else told me the same thing: that changing the font
size on screen affected the font size obtained from using
the printer icon.

As a result, I was reminded of advice, on macosxhints, with
respect to another application, to delete the associated
property list file in ~/Library/Preferences/.  The relevant
file is org.R-project.R.plist.  (It is automatically
regenerated when you restart R.)  I did so and and now find
that I now have exactly that functionality, plus another
that I did not have, which is that the width of the printout
is affected by the width of the R console window.  I'm sorry
to say I didn't test this systematically, so I'm not
entirely sure that I held everything else the same in making
this comparison.  Thus, I can't be sure that deleting the
plist file is a sure-fire cure for this problem.

Thanks David,

I'll have a look at this tomorrow.

A quick check on 10.4/R2.2.1/R Cocoa GUI 1.14 (2217) didn't
reproduce the behavior you described. Can you send me your
plist (~/Library/Preferences/org.R-project.R.plist)?

As this is Mac specific, R-Sig-Mac is a better alias.

I have uploaded a new set of compilers today - the links and details  
are on the Wiki:
http://wiki.urbanek.info/index.cgi?TigerGCC

This is the first time gfortran is universal (i.e. runs on both ppc

with it (e.g. -arch ppc -arch ppc64). Intel gfortran target works  
only with the gcc 4.0.3 and only on Intel Macs.

My reading of that page implies G77 is no longer needed
(or provided for that matter). Thought CRAN G77 binaries
and GFORTRAN (G95) didn't mix. Is this the
"not yet ready for prime time" developer setup or the new
recommended setup for everyone?

PS. Is there an TrimTheFat script for your universal
compiler for those of us who will not be upgrading anytime
soon?

Given that Intel Macs are just becoming available and we had hard  
time getting the right compliers, I'd like to share a "release  
candidate" of universal R (i.e. native on both ppc and i686) with you  
before it goes to CRAN. It passes "make check", but other parts like  
the GUI were not tested thoroughly. Please give it a shot and report  
any problems to me. The image is (temporarily) available at
http://www.rosuda.org/misc/R-2.2.1-universal.dmg
MD5 (R-2.2.1-universal.dmg) = 3f3a8a6fdf08778ec24cb3bcba4f31dd

It was designed to work on Mac OS X 10.4.4, but feel free to let me  
know how it works on other versions (the Intel part will definitely  
work on 10.4.4 and higher only). If everything goes well and there  
are no bad bugs, it should make it to CRAN soon.

I should have made this more clear: The new compilers are NOT meant  
for the 32-bit ppc CRAN release of R - the supplied G77 is still  
recommended. You cannot mix gcc3 and gcc4 binaries - that didn't  
change. The gfortran is supplied for developers that have to rely on  
gcc4 for one reason or another. Although there are still some issues  
with gcc4, it is the only way to get i686 and 64-bit/G5 ppc builds of  
R on OS X (Apple doesn't ship gcc3 for Intel Macs).

If you are not experimenting with your own builds of R, just ignore it.

No, but you're free to use lipo to do it if you feel like it.  
However, I wouldn't thin any libraries, because then you won't be  
able to build universal binaries yourself.

Simon, thanks for the binary release. i have an intel iMac for 2

anyway, i eagerly tried, have the following message after R.app

I also installed library from binary and sources, everything is fine,  
source compiled well. except at the end, there is a message saying

nothing harmful so far. I will use R to do my usual stuff as much as  
I can in the next week and let you any bugs.

Hello.

I'm using R 2.2.1 from Emacs and ESS.
It works fine, but when I try to plot something, nothing happens;
I see again the R prompt and a file .ps is created in the working
directory.

Of course in R-GUI plot is ok.

I don't use X11. I use Aqua plot.

Any idea?

Thanks in advance,

This is the expected behavior - you are not using X11, so the default  
device is the PostScript device.

What is "Aqua plot"? I fear you don't have much of a choice - if I  
recall correctly X11 is the only stock interactive device that works  
in ESS. Jan de Leeuw posed some hints as of how you can try patch R  
to get Quartz to respond in some circumstances, but I don't know if  
that works with your Emacs (there are many variations of Emacs for OS  
X) - you may want to have a look at the archives.

I have had the same experience when trying to plot. However, you can  
get the graph if you set options("quartz") or simply if you run quartz 
(). But you get a non-interactive quartz window. I am not sure how to  
set the default options to get the quartz device by default. I wonder  
how the R.app (GUI) does it? Can someone point us to some of the docs  
that may describe the procedure?

thanks,

This may repeat prior advice given here, or elsewhere, if so I wasn't
able to find it.  But I thought it might be worthwhile to report that a
possible consequence of using gfortran with libgfortran*dylibs is
that R CMD check is essentially  disabled.  I learned this last
May  from Simon  (see message below) had forgotten it, and then
experienced the same thing on my office G5 today, had a mild
sensation of deja vu, and fortunately was
able to dig out the prior email.  Removing  libgfortran*dylib
in /usr/local/lib and recompiling R has restored the functionality
of R CMD check.  Except for this behavior, the prior version
of R seemed fine....

Thanks again to Simon for this advice and all his other efforts!

My first guess is that you're using gfortran with dynamic libgfortran  
library. You may look for Brian's post about this. My work-around is  
to use static library (i.e. remove libgfortran*dylib before compiling  
R), but I think Brian added a flag that allows you to compile R with  
static gfortran libs even if dynamic ones are present. A simple test  
is as follows: create some dummy R script (let's say foo.R) that  
prints something and run R --vanilla < foo.R then try cat foo.R | R -- 
vanilla . If the latter works but the first doesn't then you have  
that gfortran problem. It basically prevents R from running any tests.

Simon

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] R crash log
Message-ID: <873AB342-2B69-457D-9BCF-79A1EEAB4475@kagi.com>

Hi,

This is a crash that occurred while R was within a long optimisation  
using nlm, it had been going for about 2 days. The function to be  
optimised doesn't do anything unusual except for some print  
statements and I would be surprised if it was reproducible, as it has  
successfully completed several runs.

Ken

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Is this an approximation I should expect,
	or a sign of a problem in the Universal Binary?
Message-ID: <20060216024325.26840.qmail@web50910.mail.yahoo.com>

As a test, I ran a test file in R that was a rewrite
of a very simple Octave/Matlab problem.

Here's the Octave/Matlab script:

sigma_tf = 60e6; % N/m^2
sigma_cf = 500e6; % N/m^2

P = -1200e3; % N
T = 10e3; % N*m
SF = 3;

diary Prob3Hw2.txt
format long

r = sqrt(roots([(sigma_cf*sigma_tf/(SF*(sigma_cf -
sigma_tf)))^2 ... 
                -P*sigma_cf*sigma_tf/(SF*pi*(sigma_cf
- sigma_tf)) ...
                0 ...
                -(2*T/pi)^2]))

format

r_in_mm = r(3)*1e3

diary off

Both Octave and Matlab, as far as I can tell, treat
r(3) as a real number, not a complex number with a
really small imaginary part. Octave gave the value of
r(3) as 0.045170515826988, and Matlab gave it as
0.04517051582699. The other two values of R are
complex.

Here's the R program:

sigma_tf <- 60e6 # N/m^2
sigma_cf <- 500e6 # N/m^2

P <- -1200e3 # N
T <- 10e3 # N*m
SF <- 3

r <- sqrt(polyroot(c(-(2*T/pi)^2, 0,
         -P*sigma_cf*sigma_tf/(SF*pi*(sigma_cf -
sigma_tf)),
         (sigma_cf*sigma_tf/(SF*(sigma_cf -
sigma_tf)))^2)))

If I type "print(Re(r[1]), digits = 14)", I get what
Octave gets for r(3), but the imaginary part is small
but nonzero, -5.457521e-31.

Is this normal or is this a sign that something is 
subtly off?

The Octave calcs were done before I migrated to
Mac-intel, and were done on a PPC eMac. The Matlab
calcs were done thru Rosetta, and the R calcs were
Intel-native.

James,

I'd say the quick answer is yes.

I'm not familiar enough with the Jenkins-Traub algorithm to run a  
thorough numerical analysis, but when you look at the magnitude of  
the coefficients, the relative error is way below machine eps (which  
is at ca. 1e-16), hence I'd say yes to the first part of your  
question. Interestingly you get exactly the same result on amd64  
running Linux, therefore no on the second part of the question.

Cheers,
Simon

Hi Folks,
This is a cross posting, sort of. I posted something similar to r-help.
I am running Mac OS 10.4.4, and the (now) the latest stable build of  
R Version 2.2.1  (2005-12-20 r36812), with the latest acepack version.
I run the example for avas (in acepack package), and R always  crashes.
Below is the Apple Crash Report.
Any thoughts?
Thank you,
Hank

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] R 2.2.1/Cocoa - internal editor cpu/mem leaks;
	external editor call doesn't work
Message-ID: <03C6D620-FB54-42BD-A563-10B67A36BA0B@neticare.com>

R 2.2.1   on OS X  10.4.3   (also seen on OS X 10.3.9)
via the Cocoa GUI:


* The R internal editor rails the cpu to 100% when open, even when it  
is just sitting in the background -- probably is using polling.

* There appears to be a memory leak with the internal editor, whereby  
every time the editor is loaded and exited, the R app consumes at  
least 1.2MB of additional memory, and fails to release it.   A simple  
cycle of:
	loop:
		fix(abc)
		close the edit window

will apparently increase the R real memory allocation without bound.


* Possibly related to the above, as the internal editor is invoked  
repeatedly over time, it takes increasingly longer to load the edit  
window.


* We have also observed a condition where simply mouse-click  
switching between the Rconsole window and another R window containing  
a displayed graph - but not actually doing anything other than  
clicking back and forth,  increases the R real memory usage by  
10-20KB on each series of clicks.

* Editing via external editor does not seem to work.  The fix() call  
invokes the external application, but returns immediately.  The  
external editor starts up fine, and sees the tempfile, but any  
editing done to it is never seen  (since the fix() has already  
returned).   Tested with editors like TextWrangler, Smultron, TextEdit.


These bugs make it problematic to run long R sessions with heavy  
editing, as the R session starts to drag more and more   (and can   
induce other application (possibly even system) crashes as other apps  
fail to run in the diminishing memory space).

Thanks for your great work on the Cocoa R, which is extremely useful  
to us.

Best regards,

John

John,

Thanks very much for the feedback.

Which version of R.app are you using?

I have tried some of your steps on MAC OS X 10.4.5 with R 2.2.1 and
R.app v 1.14 (2298).

> * The R internal editor rails the cpu to 100% when open, even when it

On my system, with menumeters on, typically the load is 10%/5%
when the system is idle with just R running. If I open, say through open
file in the menu, an (internal) editor window, the load goes up for a  
second or
so ( e.g. 36%/18%) and than falls back to above numbers. Same for the  
next
set of additional edit windows (I've tried up to 10 simultaneous windows
this morning).

If I open the internal editor using fix or edit(functionname) the  
load will stay up
higher (e.g., I've seen 60%/14%) while R is kept 'waiting'.

My system is a powerbook G4, guess above numbers will be slightly  
different
for other systems, but on my G5 they are similar.

> * Editing via external editor does not seem to work.  The fix() call

Which is the documented behavior for the external editor (section  
4.4.6 of
the FAQ for R on Mac OS). How I use it is to source the file back to  
R after
I make edits (using AppleScript). For fix() and edit() you will have  
to insert
the 'functionname <-' before sourcing it back to R. Which I think is ok,
usually I end up saving the edited file anyway.

I think the 1st step should be to compare the cpu usage and then look
into the memory issues. In your examples below, do you start/stop the  
editor
using edit/fix 10s, 100s or 1000s of times before you see a noticeable
difference?

Phil,

Thanks for the tip.  I have tried rebuilding the RMySQL library, but  
it always fails.  When I run:

R CMD INSTALL --configure-args='--with-mysql-inc=/usr/local/mysql/ 
include --with-mysql-lib=/usr/local/mysql/lib' /Users/jason/Desktop/ 
RMySQL_0.5-7.tar.gz.tar

I get ...

gcc-3.3 -bundle -flat_namespace -undefined suppress -L/usr/local/lib - 
o RMySQL.so RS-DBI.o RS-MySQL.o -L/usr/local/mysql/lib -lmysqlclient - 
lz -lcc_dynamic -F/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/.. -framework R
ld: can't locate file for: -lcc_dynamic
make: *** [RMySQL.so] Error 1
ERROR: compilation failed for package 'RMySQL'

The MySQL that I have is 5.0.18 that I downloaded as a binary  
directly from mysql.com.  Is your mySQL installation from elsewhere?   
What do you mean "...that I installed through port."

It sounds like you have everything working.  What commands did you  
use to get mySQL 5 installed?  To get  RMySQL compiled?  Any help  
here is appreciated. I am heavily dependent on R working with mySQL  
for my project.

Thanks,

- Jason

Jason,

please consult the R FAQ for Mac OS X, this has been discussed many  
times - run
sudo gcc_select 3.3

Just in case you are using Xcode 2.2.1, you may also want to read this:
https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-mac/2006-January/002593.html

As it says, last time I checked, I had no problem using the stock  
MySQL libraries (i.e. simply the binary from www.mysql.com), no need  
to re-compile it.

Cheers,
Simon

Message-ID: <D4109F60-0C76-4C8F-9B52-B9359368B1BD@r-project.org>

The universal binary (i.e. working on both Intel and PPC Macs) of R  
2.2.1 is now officially on CRAN. It requires Mac OS X 10.4.4 or  
higher. If you have G4/G5 and run R 2.2.1 already, then you don't  
need to install it, because the PPC framework didn't change.

The image contains Tcl/Tk 8.4.12 (universal), gcc 4.0.3 with a custom  
patch (Intel only), g77 3.4 (PPC only) and threaded-ATLAS (Intel  
only, because it outperforms vecLib more than 2:1). If you don't plan  
to compile packages from sources, you can safely de-select the gcc  
and ATLAS during the installation. Otherwise the only compiler for  
Intel Macs currently supported by R is the one contained in the  
image. Nevertheless, you still need developer tools to compile  
packages anyway (for the headers etc.).

The binary is identical to the RC I posted here earlier, so those who  
use it don't need to upgrade.

Cheers,
Simon

Can someone tell me how to open a new Quartz device window from a

Quartz device windows in R.app and then plot a graph in each one.   
Seems simple, but not something I could find in the docs.

Maybe I'm missing something, but did you try
?quartz
If that's not what you are looking for, please let us know more  
specifically what it is you want to do.

Aqua GUI 1.13 (1930).
R 2.2.0

With DBI package loaded, when I type "format" in the spotlight help  
field below the toolbar, I get the help page for "print.list.pairs  
{DBI}".  If DBI is unloaded, I get the "format {base}" help page.

Problem does not occur when running R from Emacs in inferior-ESS  
mode, so I am pretty sure it is Aqua GUI-specific.

I take it back.  It happens using iESS as well.  Not a Mac issue  
(just a strange choice of indexing in the DBI package).  Please ignore.

Radku,

warning 1 is ok, R re-defines the signgam function that is also  
provided by the system library

warning 2 comes from the fact that you are using an unusual  
combination of settings that generates an invalid locale not  
supported by the system (english language with czech locale)*.

You can select czech language in the "System Preferences"- 
 >"International"->"Language" (you will have to click on "Edit  
List.." to make "?e?tina" visible in the list) - that will lead to  
cs_CZ.UTF-8 locale which is valid.

Another alternative is to force the R GUI to select other locale  
independently of your system settings, so you could use for example

defaults write org.R-project.R force.LANG en_US.UTF-8
or
defaults write org.R-project.R force.LANG cs_CZ.UTF-8

or any other valid locale (make sure it's UTF-8, though).

Cheers,
?imon

* - in a sense this is R GUI's fault, but there is no canonical  
locale defined in OS X, so all we can do is guess and we're combining  
the language and locale settings to create one canonical locale. This  
won't work for combinations like yours, because then we need separate  
LC_ALL and LANG. This is why we recommend manual override with  
force.LANG in the defaults in such cases. We have to specify a  
locale, because R GUI can only handle UTF-8 encoding.

Hi,

I need to do some spatial habitat modeling in grasp (er) and I'm  
using the Mac OSX version of the R binary (1.14 build 2129)

I used the package installer to install the grasper package, but I  
get a tcltk error when I try to load it.

Do I need a tcltk version of R to run this, and If so where can I  
find this?

Thanks

Ken

PS Here is the error message given when loading grasper

Yes, and it is included in the R release disk image (dmg) from CRAN,  
but it is optional, so you have to choose "custom install" and select  
it. You can also find the separate "tcltk" installer in the  
"Packages" directory of the image. Don't forget that this is X11 Tcl/ 
Tk, so you also have to install Apple's X11 and have it running.

Thanks Simon,

I'll give that a try.  Will having both versions of R installed cause  
any grief?

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Redrawing bug for pairs() plot
Message-ID: <43FF8121.70704@bifx.org>

I stumbled across a minor redrawing bug for the pairs() plot today.

Create a plot in a quartz device using pairs().

quartz()
pairs( USJudgeRatings )

Enlarge the window by clicking the green (+) enlarge button in the upper 
left corner of the window. Each of the individual scatter plots is drawn 
at full size in the quartz device's window, after which the pairs plot 
is drawn normally.

This does not occur when the window is resized from the resize corner at 
the bottom right.

This also does not occur in an X11 device when running R from the xterm 
window or when running R Aqua GUI.

Ken,

I don't know if this answers your question, but start Apple's X11;  
after that, launch R.app as you normally would. After R is up &  
running, load grasper, either through the package manager or by  
library(grasper). Then, *AT THE R Commandline*, type:

grasp.GUI()

That should do it.

Regards,
Tom

Thank you very much ?imone,
I did set the locale with the "defaults" command. And do you have any
comments to the warning # 3? It seems to be a problem with permissions.

warning 3:

chmod: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.2/Resources/library/R.css:
Operation not permitted

Anyway, thank you very much for your work on the OS X version of R and
good luck in the development!

Dear all,

I have installed the latest version of R in my Mac OSX 10.4.5, and
installed the bioconductor packages. When I tried to load Rgraphviz,
it returns the following error.

I have also installed graphviz using Fink, and set the

Please let me know if there are other ways to get around this.

After updating to 10.4.5 and reinstalling the corresponding developer tools
(from the install dvd) I get the following error when compiling packages
containing c-code (it happens with several packages, among them MNP from
which the error below resulted).

The compilation does the following:

and then halts with:

** Removing '/Users/ivisser/Library/R/library/MNP'

Can anyone tell me what lcc_dynamic does and how I can obtain it/install it?

Please read the R for Mac OS X FAQ (reading this list would help,  
too) - you need to run
sudo gcc_select 3.3
before you compile R packages from sources.

It compiles out of the box without any problems (tested on 10.3.9 and  
10.4.5). Besides, is there a specific reason why you compile it  
manually instead of using the CRAN binary?

What version of graphviz did you get from fink?  

What works for me on OSX is to build graphviz from source and then R
CMD INSTALL Rgraphviz.  You may need to set PKG_CONFIG_PATH depending
on where you install graphviz.  If you go this route, I would suggest
installing a graphviz devel snapshot.

Bernard,

I can confirm the problem and there is indeed an issue with the  
current binary package. I have updated to the latest graphviz and  
built a new binary, but then I get segfaults inside graphviz on make  
check (both 2.8 and 2.9), so I'll have to dig a bit deeper. I'll keep  
you updated.

Cheers,
Simon

Just before christmas I recompiled graphviz and Rgraphviz using gcc  
3.3 and Xcode 2.2. I had loads of problems with earlier versions of  
grapviz (which I seem to recall I had been able to get working). In  
fact I spend hours trying to get it to work. But the devel version  
compiled just fine (I think that was  graphviz-2.7.20051203.0540). I  
tried that out after finding an obscure post on an email list saying  
some MacOS issues had been fixed.

Obviously I have not tried with the newest devel version. And I am  
not sure I tried make check. But Rgraphviz compiled and I could get  
it to display graphs.
