In case this has not been noticed, the x86_64 builds on mac.r-project.org
are showing errors.? This is the error from 4.1:

Testing examples for package 'base'
Warning in file(out, "wt") :
??cannot open file '/var/folders/2b/t0kwbtmn3p7brv2mvx39c9cr0000gn/T//Rtmp4ZevDn/file1399b189e156f/chol2inv.R': No space left on device
Error in file(out, "wt") : cannot open the connection
Calls:??... testInstalledPackage -> .createExdotR -> Rd2ex -> file
Execution halted
make[3]: *** [test-Examples-Base] Error 1
make[2]: *** [test-Examples] Error 2
make[1]: *** [test-all-basics] Error 1
make: *** [check] Error 2

The other two builds don't make it to the `make check` step, maybe because
of what happened on the 4.1 build if they are running concurrently.

Best,

B.

If anyone is interested in helping out, this is a good time to test R 
4.1.1 before it is released. Now is the time to look for and report

- regressions (things that worked in 4.1.0, but not in 4.1.1)
- regressions in 4.1.0 not fixed by 4.1.1
- bugs in new features in 4.1.0 not fixed by 4.1.1

For more tips and details, please see

Brodie,
thanks, good catch, there is space again after deleting old builds.
Cheers,

To whom it may concern, 

I am so sorry for being such a dunce.  I have been trying and trying to get the R App to work on my MacBook Air running Big Sur V11.4, and am just not making any progress.  It says that the package I have downloaded below should have all the elements I need including the R app GUI.  I get this error message "You can?t open the application ?R? because this application is not supported on this Mac"., are you able to help please?

Your support is much appreciated.
Lindsay Foreman

R-4.1.0-arm64.pkg <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/big-sur-arm64/base/R-4.1.0-arm64.pkg> (notarized and signed)
SHA1-hash: 7354c1b249cab9bafea6ae67c73563303a05fa17
(ca. 88MB)	R 4.1.0 binary for macOS 11 (Big Sur) and higher, Apple silicon arm64 build, signed and notarized package.
Contains R 4.1.0 framework, R.app GUI 1.76 for Apple silicon Macs (M1 and higher), Tcl/Tk 8.6.11 X11 libraries and Texinfo 6.7.
Important: this version does NOT work on older Intel-based Macs.
The above installer package will be misidentified by Apple Installer as Intel architecture although it contains no Intel code. This means you may be asked to install Rosetta 2 even though it is not required. This issue has been fixed in the packaging for future R versions, so if you don't want to install Rosetta 2 please use R-4.1-branch big-sur arm64 installer from mac.R-project.org <https://mac.r-project.org/>.
Note: the use of X11 (including tcltk) requires XQuartz <http://xquartz.macosforge.org/>. Always re-install XQuartz when upgrading your macOS to a new major version.

This release uses Xcode 12.4 and experimental GNU Fortran 11 arm64 fork. If you wish to compile R packages from sources, you may need to download GNU Fortran for arm64 from https://mac.R-project.org/libs-arm64 <https://mac.r-project.org/libs-arm64/>. Any external libraries and tools are expected to live in /opt/R/arm64 to not conflict with Intel-based software and this build will not use /usr/local to avoid such conflicts.

You could try the Intel version until the problem with ARM is sorted. It should run fine but will require Rosetta 2.

Is that an Intel or M1 MacBook?  If it's an Intel one, you don't want 
the arm64 download, you want

https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/base/R-4.1.0.pkg

It is listed on the web site as "High Sierra and higher", so it should 
work on Big Sur, but only if you have an Intel chip.

Any external libraries and tools are expected to live in /opt/R/arm64 to not conflict with Intel-based software and this build will not use /usr/local to avoid such conflicts.

I understand you are at a preliminary stage in your project, therefore, I am sure we will have another moment to chat, if you think it could be of any help. As I briefly discussed yesterday, there are some concepts and choices while performing an inverted factor analysis that require some background. Needless to say, feel free to start a conversation at any time if you have any question, I am not an expert statistician, but I know about factor analysis and the differences between the standard and the inverted one. One book I have found useful for classic factor analysis was the one from Paul Kline, An Easy Guide to Factor Analysis, From Taylor and Francis. https://doi.org/10.4324/9781315788135 <https://doi.org/10.4324/9781315788135>.

Yes, it works on Intel Big Sur.  Actually it works perfectly well on 
arm64 (aka M1) cpus, as documented in the R-admin manual and on 
https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/ .

For those with arm64 Macs, the current pros and cons of the arm64 build are

Pro:
- It is usually faster, median 1.4x on CRAN packages but in some cases 
much more so.

- There have been very occasional Intel binary packages where Rosetta 
emulation does not work (and the arm64 binary package did).

Cons:
- Less accuracy as there are no long doubles.  That has surprisingly 
little impact, in part because CRAN packages have long been checked 
without long doubles.  But people who test sum(p) == 1 are more likely 
to be caught out ....

- Fewer binary packages available, notably not from Bioconductor and 
hence CRAN packages requiring those from Bioconductor.

- In the vast majority of cases compiling packages from source will work 
(if sometimes a little trickier), but a handful of packages require 
Intel CPUs.  I have about 30 more CRAN packages failing their checks 
that for Intel builds, and about 40 than on Linux.

- Less stable.  This is as much the OS as R, with resource (e.g. RAM) 
shortages leading to hangs (of R or the whole machine) much more often 
than on an Intel Mac.  In fairly limited testing this happens more with 
the arm64 build than using the Intel build on my M1 Mac.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Issue installing gdal, sf, rgeos on R 4.1
Message-ID: <CAOo9WhGCda8bEQxY7fuu37-cAH_2kZ+oVYx7Z7FPSO8SnpUMaw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am trying to install rgdal, sf, and rgeos on R 4.1 using Apple Silicon
with native arm support. An old email
<https://r.789695.n4.nabble.com/Help-needed-gdal-configuration-to-install-sf-package-in-Mac-OS-Catalina-td4762279.html>
to the R help email list suggested emailing here given the error messages I
am receiving.

When I try to install `rgeos` or `sf` I get the following error:

> configure: error: geos-config not found or not executable.


Full error messages are at the end of the email.

I have followed the instructions here
<https://github.com/r-spatial/sf/issues/1536#issuecomment-727342736> to
install gdal using homebrew. Installation is successful, and running
`gdalinfo --version` show I am running

> GDAL 3.3.1, released 2021/06/28


I have tried uninstalling gdal, reinstalling it, building from source, and
changing the PATH (`export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/opt/gdal-33/bin`). So far,
no luck. Any help would be appreciated.


Thanks.

Steve

Did you install these "Optional Libraries, Frameworks and Applications
for macOS (arm64)" ? https://mac.r-project.org/libs-arm64/ ? and
/opt/R/arm64/bin to PATH?
