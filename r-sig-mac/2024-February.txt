Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] R graphics not updating on Sonoma M3 Pro
Message-ID: <CAOJnz6ScrOoWFhf8jS7ij38QYKT5BLznnwaRn_BnVGJ88YMGrA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I recently upgraded to a new Macbook Pro (Nov 23) with the M3 Pro chip
running Sonoma 14.3.1 and am experiencing some graphics issues.

plot(1:10) will open a graphics window just fine, but then calling
points(1:10, col=2) will not update that plot (i.e., all the points
are still black). BUT after calling plot(1:10) again and navigating
back to the previous plot I can suddenly see the updated plot (i.e.,
all the points are now red).

I'm observing the behavior in Terminal running R 4.3.2 (from both
homebrew and macports) and in R.app running R 4.4.0 (development).

Any help would be appreciated

Mike

Did you re-install XQuartz when you upgraded?  Generally one needs to when upgrading.  Bryan

While this may be problem in R  (and also the advice given by Bryan Hanson to re-install XQuartz),   generally if you are installing from MacPorts or homebrew you are on your own as for help from here.  I would also suggest installing from CRAN,  and if the problem still persists after re-installing XQuartz,  then report the issue.  There could be subtle differences in how R gets built in homebrew or MacPorts, (there also may not be)  but the people most likely to be able to know how to answer this can?t be certain if there are differences and surely do not have the time to find out.

HTH,

-Roy

Thank you. Yes, I can confirm the problem persists after re-installing
XQuartz and installing 4.3.2 from CRAN.

I confirm this happens on my M2 Max, with regular install from CRAN.
Best,
Adrian
