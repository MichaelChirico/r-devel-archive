Load works fine- I tried this in a fresh R session.
SavannahRiver.Rdata is 4KB.  the data folder resides in the first
level of the directory tree-
/Ecosystem.Production/data/SavannahRiver.Rdata .  How do I make this
reproducible, and I will do it.  What next?

Nothing here is Mac-specific, whereas the message you posted most recently 
on R-help probably is.

Look in Ecosystem.Production.Rcheck/Ecosystem.Production-manual.log
to see what the LaTeX error is (it will be a mistake in one of your .Rd 
files).

As it says, one of the Rd files is probably not correct, so the LaTex  
is not correct. Possibly the log will tell you more, but LaTex error  
messages can be very confusing.

Check your Rd files are correct. Have a look at some existing packages  
to make sure you understand the format. Remove the Rd files and then  
add individually and build to see which one is causing the failures.

If you can't work out what is going wrong, start with the simplest  
possible file and then add to it.

Message-ID: <A07059DC-766F-4EF9-B272-084860299A10@fhcrc.org>

When I select 'Local Source Package' in the R Package Installer  
window the text for the button in the lower right corner changes from  
'Install Selected' to an odd looking 'Install,??'.    In case that  
didn't come through clearly that should read Install + comma +  
capital A umlaut + paragraph symbol.

I think this might be a minor glitch in R.app since I've seen it on 3  
different machines (all running OS X v10.4.11).  Despite the odd  
appearance the button works fine to browse for local source packages.

Message-ID: <489D89FC.1080209@csse.unimelb.edu.au>

Hi,

Where does R.app, when launched from the Dock, get its environment
variables from, including PATH?

I've tried setting the PATH in ~/.bash_profile and /etc/paths, but when
launched from the Dock, it doesn't get through:
> system("echo $PATH")
/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin

If I start R.app from Terminal using
/Applications/R.app/Contents/MacOS/R, it does show up:
> system("echo $PATH")
/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/sw/bin:/usr/local/bin:/sw/sbin:/usr/X11/bin:/usr/local/git/bin/:/usr/local/bin

I'm using R 2.7.1 on Leopard 10.5.4.

Thanks,
Gad

The Window Manager in OS X does not execute as you nor does it spawn a  
shell to start a process so your bash profile is never called. There  
are ways to change the environment variables through editing the

Thanks Byron, that did the job.

I created a file ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist containing:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" 
"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
	<key>PATH</key>
<string>/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/sw/bin:/usr/local/bin:/sw/sbin:/usr/X11/bin:/usr/local/git/bin/</string>
</dict>
</plist>

Now R can see the full path when launched from the dock.

Cheers,
Gad

Hi,

I am using osx 10.4.11 with R version 2.7.1. I am trying to create a
share lib from a little C code and I am getting some errors, which I
cannot make anything out of. The code written is fine, since I am able
to compile it on a linux elsewhere. Any help would be appreciated.

Here's the error --
===
R CMD SHLIB mckvf.c

Rostam,

Which version of R.app, R and OSX are you running.

Do other preferences work fine? Can you change them?

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] quartz window size inside the window while resizing
Message-ID: <FF5EEC78-4DE5-476B-8B96-82DE7D57568D@gmx.de>

Hello,

I had to reinstall R on my Mac (Leopard) because of an error.
Now I have a newer Version and when I plot something and want to  
resize the quartz-window I don't see the pixel-width ...


Before the reinstallation I saw the width and height in pixel while  
resizing the quartz window inside of the window.
That was really useful.

I haven't found any options, and don't know anything about the quartz- 
system.

Can anybody help me about that?

Newer than what?  The quartz() devices in 2.6.x and 2.7.x are completely 
different.

The version I have now is 2.7.1

I don't know which version was installed before the crash.

Is there any way to get this "feature" back?
So that I can see how big (in pixels) my quartz-window is.

No that feature has been removed in the new quartz device for 2.7.0.

 From the launchd process (or LS in general, details depend on the  
version of OS X you use).

That is as expected since launchd doesn't read those. You can use  
Environment.plist for processes started by LS, see

My guess would be some 3rd party compilers that don't work properly.  
Make sure you're using Xcode 2.4 or higher (2.5 is the current version  
for Tiger) and that you don't have any broken compilers (e.g. from  
HPC) in /usr/local. If in doubt rename (or delete) /usr/local and try  
again.

Cheers,
Simon

The old Quartz didn't have the ability to show plot content in live  
resize, so it was using that text as a filler. The new Quartz device  
is able to provide a preview so it doesn't need that kludge anymore  
(and it has many other new features).

We could add that information, I wasn't aware it was any useful - it  
was really just a hack ...

actually it was intentional Simon. Maybe, now that we have live  
content resize, we should show that info in the window bar

Today, I downloaded the most recent binary for R.app.  I'm running on 
MacOSX 10.4.11.

Downloading packages fail.  I've tried it at the command line and 
using the "Packages & Data" menu.  In both cases, trying to

   This is my package, but I don't think there's anything wrong with
the package (the check summary on CRAN says it's OK).  Does this happen
with all packages?  Have you tried a different mirror? (123 K seems
like a reasonable size for this package).

   On the other hand, the specific error message says the problem
is that R can't find the "tar" command -- is it in your path?

Please, R 2.5.1 is long obsolete.  As the R posting guide says, update 
your R *before* posting.  At this point (with pre-releases of R 2.7.2 
imminent), please try a daily build of R-patched.

It seems a problem with the quartz() device, and that has been completely 
rewitten since.

Your code is not directly reproducible: it is unhelpful not to give an 
example which can just be pasted in.

I was simply following the instructions given (in the R2.5.1 release,  
I guess).

There was a request for the email about the routine.

I did not try to run the segment autonomously.

In fact, it was easier to find that I was making several mistaken
assumptions about the arguments to qqplot and predict,
specifically using "data =" rather than "newdata =" though
_perhaps_ qqplot could catch some of resulting mess.

If you would like further emails when a problem has
been resolved, it would be great to read that such email is
encouraged.  I just did not want further spam (such as this one!)

thank you!  Bob

PS:  NASA is trying to put institutional barriers to things like
updating R as you suggest, but I will do all I can.  It is important
to speak out against central-point-failure regimes of "computer
software security" in all large organizations.   These put updating
in the hands of those who have no experience with the packages
that scientists use.  "Do it with Excel" would be the reply to request,
or the request would be delayed until it could be billed to my  
resources.
This condition is all to common, ... sigh.

Glad that R is so distributed !  Thanks.

That error was usually seen when plotting in a minimized window. This  
was fixed in subsequent R releases (and the wording of the exception  
was changed to encourage update). Simply restoring the Quartz window  
should work, the error should be otherwise harmless. Nonetheless as  
Brian pointed out Quartz was entirely rewritten for R 2.7.x so  
updating is strongly encouraged.

Cheers,
Simon

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] warnings on windows but not on mac os
Message-ID: <3D95581C-B2A6-42A2-8A12-B758F7122E7F@gmail.com>

Hi,

Before sending new version of randtoolbox on CRAN, I'll try to test it  
on different OS, namely windows xp, than mac os x. When building the  
package which includes C code, I get no warnings on my macbook (mac os  
leopard) but warnings appeared on my pc (windows xp home).

Do you have any idea why I get the following warnings?

  warning: "/*" within comment
  warning: no newline at end of file
  warning: unused variable 'rest'

Does I need to do something on my mac to get those warnings?

Thanks in advance

Kind regards

Christophe

Compile C with -Wall (or even -Wall -pedantic).

You also need to sort out your use of 'inline': as I recall the Apple gcc 
has C99 semantics turned on when it is not on in the released FSF versions 
of gcc (4.3 or later).  This makes testing rather tricky (but see the R 
sources for what works for us, especially Rinlinedfunctions.h).

If, for whatever reason, you are a CLI addict and insist on running R  
from
Terminal.app, then a major nuisance is that ? and ?? write to the same
terminal window. This can be helped by installing AquaLess from
http://aqualess.sourceforge.net/ and setting options(pager="aless")
in R. This allows you to browse R objects by page() as well.

You can also use aless to pipe man output if you export PAGER=aless
in bash.

Aqualess did not work properly in Leopard/Tiger for about 2 years,
but version 1.6 seems to be fine. Of course R.app gives you the
multiple windows and much more.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] R for Mac survey
Message-ID: <E4C145E4-B454-40C1-A2C5-8666A2F66863@r-project.org>

Dear Mac users,

in order to make more informed decisions about future support of Mac  
binaries, I'd like to invite all users of R for Mac to take part is a  
very quick (and automated) survey. See
http://r.research.att.com/survey/
for details, but the essence is that you can participate by typing

source("http://r.research.att.com/survey.R")

in R on your Mac (regardless of GUI/R version etc.). It will send just  
one line containing the info about R, OS version, architecture and  
machine type to our server and it will show you the content before  
it's sent (so you can decline to submit it).

I'd like to encourage especially people that rely on CRAN binaries to  
participate (feel free to tell your colleagues/friends/...).
(The submissions will be confidential and if at all I'll publish only  
aggregated results.)

Thanks,
Simon

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] double dyn.load hang up
Message-ID: <B247B1F7-D7C3-49C3-8D6D-FEA4811304A4@uiuc.edu>

I had a rather mysterious problem that now seems to have been
attributable to dyn.load()ing the same object twice in one R session
and I would be curious to know if this is a known issue, or something
that I should try to document further:

I had a single fortran subroutine which I was making into a .so file
with the usual R CMD SHLIB ritual.  Then I would run a test problem
which involved dyn.load()ing the .so object, sourcing an R function
that called .Fortran, generating some random data and finally invoking
the R function when I sourced a file that looked like this:

# Initial test of parq algorithm
p <- 30
n <- 200
x <- matrix(rnorm(p*n),n,p)
y <- rnorm(n)
dyn.load("parq.so")
source("parq.q")
z <- parq(x,y,lambda = -1)

That is z contained a perfectly sensible result, but when I sourced this
file a second time and then tried to look at "z"  the R process hung.   
This
happened on both my old G5 desktop running 2.7.1 and on a new intel
mac-pancake running 2.7.1.  However, on several other machines 3
linuxes and one solaris everything was copasetic, no hangups after
the second invocation.

After much agonizing under the assumption that there was something
wrong with memory allocation in my fortran -- a hypothesis that had
quite a lot of historical support -- I finally tried just running the  
parq
function without the double  invocation of dyn.load  and this worked
perfectly.  From which I draw the moral:

	Don't dyn.load twice, it's not (mac)-nice.

Roger,

can you give us a simple, reproducible example, please? From your  
description it's not clear to me what is your speculation and what are  
the facts. Running dyn.load twice is very dangerous in general unless  
you know what you're doing, especially with dylibs involving Fortran,  
because those usually contain initializer functions that may have  
unexpected side effects. This is common to all platforms, not just Macs.

Cheers,
Simon

Simon,

Running dyn.load twice is certainly dumb, I just didn't realize that  
it was also
dangerous.  (And I was surprised, in retrospect, that it didn't also  
cause
problems on our linux boxes.)  I've put a toy example at:

	http://www.econ.uiuc.edu/~roger/research/qss/toy.tar.gz

that I hope will be self explanatory.   Thanks for looking into this,  
of course
I recognize that this probably fits into the category of trimming my  
toenails
with a chainsaw that shouldn't be covered by product liability -- even  
if there
were product liability for R, which there isn't.

Roger

Hi,

first setWavPlayer() expects an UNIX shell command. To open it with  
e.g. QuickTime one should use this:

setWavPlayer('open -a \"QuickTime Player.app\"')

[Ignore the error message]

Then the tricky point is that QuickTime cannot open temp files written  
by the play() function (?maybe access rights; or the sound lib is  
written with Windows-like paths?)

Thus I wrote my own play() function

myplay <- function(s, ...) {
   f <- paste(tempdir(), "/Temp_Sound.wav", sep='')
   if (file.exists(f)) {file.remove(f)}
   saveSample(s, f)
   play(f, ...)
}


Now if I invoke myplay(s) QuickTime opens that temp file and I can  
press SPACE to play. If you want to play the sound automatically you  
can set this in QuickTime's preferences 'Automatically play movies  
when opened'

Other possibilities would be:
- look for a command line program for Leopard which can play wav files
- write an AppleScript script which takes the argument to open/play it  
with QuickTime; save that script and set setWavPlayer('osascript /PATH/ 
TO/SCRIPT')

Stop. I've just read the source code. On Mac you should write:

setWavPlayer('open -a \"QuickTime Player.app\"')
play(s, stay=TRUE)

If stay = FALSE the temp file will be deleted immediately after  
creation (?)

BTW the error message after setWavPlayer results by the issue that the  
test wav file is in some sense corrupt.
Furthermore findWavPlayer() is not up-to-date, thus it couldn't find  
an adequate player for Leopard ;)

I will contact the maintainer.

Maybe a good command line tool for playing sounds (aiff aifc wav mp3  
ulw au snd mid m4a m4p) on a Mac can be found here:

http://www.hieper.nl/html/play.html

After downloading you can copy it to e.g. /usr/local/bin
and do setWavPlayer("play").

As I mentioned before you can preset autoplay in QuickTime's  
preferences and you can use the default 'play(s, stay=TRUE)'. There is  
no need for myplay if you set stay to TRUE.

Yes. 'play' can be invoked without stay=TRUE.

BTW with Audacity it works as well if stay=TRUE.

I rewrote the R code for findWavPlayer(), play.default(), and  
play.Sample() to interact with Mac better.
Furthermore if options()$wavplayer is not a 'open -a' command the  
chosen shell command runs in the background, thus you can with R  
further without waiting for e.g. 'play'. This behavior led me to  
introduce a new MacOSX function called 'stopPlay()' which kills the  
shell process (if not 'open -a'). Additionally I changed these scripts  
to use only one temp file. To work with it with QuickTime I also  
included an Applescript to control QuickTime.

I will post my changes to Matthias Heymann who is the maintainer of  
that package.

Cheers,

FWIW the default should be to use "open" because that allows the user  
to map .wav to any applications they desire, you should not be hard- 
coding that in your code via -a.
On a similar note sound could do a better job of finding player since  
most users that deal with audio/video are likely to already have  
mplayer installed, so checking for mplayer and play may be a good idea.
Finally, playing sound on OS X takes one line of code, so adding a  
player directly to the package would be trivial (or maybe creating a  
package that does the playing if desired..).

Cheers,
Simon

Yes of course. In my script I only check if the command begins with  
'open'.

Yeap.

setWavPlayer is doing this. It sets options()$wavplayer. It simply  
contains the shell command.
The tricky thing is the chosen procedure of findWavPlayer. It tests  
for hard-coded known applications for a given OS platform. But this  
could be done better.

The problem here was that the new Macs with Leopard are too fast ;) I  
tried it out with my old Tiger ppc Mac (1.8GHz) and everthing works  
fine, but on my new G5 with 8 cores 3GHz it doesn't work.

But I'm just in contact with maintainer. Maybe we find a good solution  
for it.

Cheers,

That's my point - I was talking about native playback. When I said one  
line of code I meant Obj-C not shell, so you don't need any external  
application. To be precise to play an audio file all you do is
[[[NSSound initWithContentsOfFile:fileName byReference:YES]  
autorelease] play];
Thats' all :)

Simon

Ah, you mean that the function play(A_SOUND_FILE) should be part of  
R's core code which implements it for a given platform.
This of course would be the best way.

I also had a look at the tuneR package. Well, by my opinion it would  
be worth to put the sound and tuneR packages together. There're some  
functions which do in principal the same thing, thus one shouldn't  
reinvent the wheel twice.

R 2.7.2 for Mac OS X binary is now available on CRAN.

It is a bugfix release and is recommended for all Mac users. If you  
installed R 2.7.1 before then you can use the "mini" version to update.

Cheers,

This is actually an R-sig-mac question so I am responding there.


In general, if you want to install a new version without losing the 
previous packages,  using the finder, go to Library/Receipts and 
remove the R.app and R.Gui receipts.  Then install the new version. 
That will keep the previous packages.  This is not mysterious, this 
is R.


Thanks to Simon et al. for the upgrade.

Bill

I thought about it a bit. For Mac it would be trivial, but for Windows  
and Linux I do not know. They have to support many sound card drivers.  
For Linux you have different window servers, and distributions.
The next point once you have such a built-in function like  
playSoundFile(f) how to control it, i.e how to stop it for instance;  
esp. for the case that you're playing more than one sound file at a  
time (which works a Mac with play very well).

To use the approach to open a sound file by the default application is  
in some sense better. On Mac it's easy, just type 'open FILE', for  
Windows this works only in some cases. One could use 'start FILE' but  
'start' is not an executable it's a DOS command thus one could write a  
BAT file open.BAT ? la 'start %1'. The tricky point is Linux in that  
respect I believe. I do not know any command which can do this. The  
Linux shell command 'play' is not part of any distribution.
This leads to a next problem. If there would be a general solution to  
play a sound file using the default app OK but if the user can set up  
the player to 'mplayer32.exe', or 'play' etc. how to distinguish  
between a shell command, which could run in the background (how to  
control it?), and a app based program like 'Windows Media Player' or  
'QuickTime' etc.?


The only idea I have for now is to use a scripting language to write a  
primitive audio player, and the only language which is installed by  
default on all these platforms is Java. It shouldn't be that problem  
to write such a JFrame jar.

Cheers,

No, because that just throws the problem onto R-core, including long-term 
maintenance, for what is a real minority interest.  It should be a 
user-maintained package.

Please do your homework:  Windows R has long provided shell.exec() and as 
from R 2.8.0 will have open.exe (for use in shell scripts such as 
Rd2dvi.sh).

So all you need to do on Windows R is shell.exec("filename"), even easier 
than Simon's suggestion.

What about all the other platforms R runs on -- FreeBSD, Solaris, AIX, 
IRIX, ...?

But having a working Java is a problem.

The standard R mechanisms for installing packages into a different library
apply on Mac OS X just as anywhere else.  It was not said that R was being 
run from the R.app GUI, but I'll assume that is the case.

The rw-FAQ provides detailed advice for Windows users: see

http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/rw-FAQ.html#What_0027s-the-best-way-to-upgrade_003f
http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/rw-FAQ.html#I-don_0027t-have-permission-to-write-to-the-R_002d2_002e7_002e2_005clibrary-directory

The differences for Mac OS users are small -- some of the names and how to 
set the library path via R_LIBS.

We arrange not to install packages within .Library on any of our systems 
-- and for most users they do not have permission to do so.

So, what it boils down to is that I'm installing my packages at too  
high of a level (I'm an administrator for my system) and should save  
them in places other than the R framework folder.

Thanks too all for the tips and links.

Exactly, and your situation is similar to mine. To answer Rolf's  
question about R_LIBS not being seen when you click R.app from the  
Finder, the answer is that any application run through the GUI does  
not at all read your shell login files, like .bash_profile or  
whatever else you are using. It inherits the Finder's environment  
instead of the shell's environment. There are two solutions:

1) Set R_LIBS in a file like .bash_profile, which is then read  
whenever a terminal window opens, and then every time start R.app  
from the terminal window via the command:
"open -a R". Then this R process will be inheriting the shell's  
environment.
2) Create a file ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist containing this R_LIBS  
definition, as specified in http://developer.apple.com/qa/qa2001/ 
qa1067.html. This file is respected by all GUI apps as well. Requires  
a system restart. If you go with this option, I would try to keep  
this file as minimal as possible.

The update doesn't affect any package that you installed and the GUI  
remembers them (see R for Mac FAQ 5.2) - click on the search field pop- 
up in Package Installer and it will offer you to select all packages  
you have installed in the previous version of R.

In addition, trying to set R_LIBS via environment is a bad idea since  
there are so many ways R can be started, so please use .Rprofile  
or .Renviron as suggested in the documentation.

Cheers,
Simon

Fortunately all OSes have API that is independent of the sound card  
and it has nothing to do with the window servers. There is one API on  
Windows and one on Macs. For unix it's not as easy since there is no  
real standard across unices, but supporting OSS and/or ALSA should  
cover the need of the majority of users.

That is something you cannot easily do with command line tools but is  
trivial in the native implementation. In addition, you're not  
restricted to files, you could play off R functions or vectors...

I would dispute "better" here - if anything it's the easiest, because  
you're offloading the task to another application...

I suspect you're talking about something entirely different - JFrame  
won't give you any sound playback ;). But, yes, using Java would be  
one option except that Java is quite a heavy requirement for such  
task ...

Yes of course ;) I menat with JFrame only a tiny GUI with a PLAY and  
a STOP button. I wrote such a Java program and it works. The jar file  
is about 30k and it is quite fast and I do not load the entire sound  
file at once, only buffer by buffer (it only plays linear PCM audio  
files aiff, linear wav, au, and some others).

Now I only try to avoid a GUI. It looks different on each OS, thus I  
try to write a simple command line tool which appears in the task  
bar. To simply stop the sound close that command line tool via the  
task bar.

Message-ID: <16025E75-62B7-48F3-8E08-589716F41D07@stat.berkeley.edu>

I want to get a suitable gfortran for Xcode 3.1 under Leopard in order  
to build x86_64

Despite reading the "tools" and "building" pages on r.research.att.com  
I am still confused. The comment on GCC 4.2 on the "building" page  
seems to indicate that I should look under the "Alternative" section  
on "tools".

Here I see gfortran-42.pkg which has a build of 5531. But my  
version(s) of GCC are

kasper-hansens-macbook:~/Work/packages/> gcc --version
i686-apple-darwin9-gcc-4.0.1 (GCC) 4.0.1 (Apple Inc. build 5484)

and at the top of the page I see gfortran-4.2.3.pkg which seems to be  
a later version (but has no build information).

So which one should I use?

Thanks

An issue that is somewhat related: I was surprised to see a gfortran  
in both /usr/local/bin and /usr/bin, probably because I both had  
installed gfortran-42.pkg and the gfortran that comes with R-2.7.0. I  
(based on nothing but expectations) was expecting to just have  
gfortran in /usr/local. Is there any "policy" regarding this?

gfortran-42.pkg complements Apple's gcc-4.2 compiler so if you have  
Apple's gcc-4.2 then that is the way to go.

I don't see "gfortran-4.2.3.pkg" on the page, but there is  
"gfortran-4.2.3.dmg" which is a pure GNU Fortran (thus it doesn't have  
any Apple build number) living in /usr/local, independent of the Apple  
compilers. That is what we supply with R since we cannot rely on  
gcc-4.2 (until recently it was not available to the public). Also it  
lives in /usr/local to be fully independent.

As for the build numbers - Apple is very slow in releasing sources for  
their binaries, so the current build is usually not available.  
(Apparently they have put 5564 up just a few days ago, so I'll build  
the updated version soon, but if you're using just the gfortran part  
there will be likely no changes sine the Fortran sources come from FSF).

Cheers,
Simon

Thanks a lot, that was very helpful.

On a side note I am surprised to see that R-devel's configure script  
picks up
   /usr/local/bin/gfortran-4.2
instead of
   /usr/bin/gfortran-4.2
even though /usr/bin is ahead of /usr/local/bin in my path. Is that an  
autoconf setting, that /usr/local/bin is always first, or is it an R  
thing or?

Here is my path
kasper-hansens-macbook:~/Source/R-devel/> echo $PATH
/Users/khansen/Bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/ 
texbin:/usr/X11/bin

and here is a relevant snippet from config.log
PATH: /usr/X11/bin
PATH: /usr/local/bin
PATH: /Users/khansen/Bin
PATH: /usr/bin
PATH: /bin
PATH: /usr/sbin
PATH: /sbin
PATH: /usr/local/bin
PATH: /usr/texbin
PATH: /usr/X11/bin
PATH: /usr/local/bin

It seems like /usr/X11/bin and /usr/local/bin is prepended to the PATH  
setting/
