That user-contributed software can cause internal corruption in R is 
well known.  These are both symptoms of that.

Follow the posting guide at http://www.r-project.org/posting-guide.html 
(and post general R questions on R-help: what might possibly have been 
Mac-specific here?).

1) you say the problem is caused by using the package impute but you do not explain what function causes the issue or whether R code that would normally run fine stops working once you load the library
2) in either case the first port of call is the package maintainer, not R-sig-mac

Please do provide extensive exaples to the package maintainer, with code and data explaining what you are trying to do, what is not working and what you expect to see.  Be advised that, if *you* are just not writing code correctly or making any other mistake, you could be told to Read The Fine Manual.

I have a couple of questions:

1. Should I be able to specify the background color of an R64.app editor window?  Setting the background color of the console does not seem to affect the editor. 

2. Is Rswitch still available?  I get a 'not found' message when I follow the link to http://r.research.att.com/RSwitch-1.2.dmg.

Thanks,

Matthew

No.  And see the notes in the FAQ at 
http://r.research.att.com/man/RMacOSX-FAQ.html#Why-is-R_002ehome_0028_0029-not-versioned_003f

At present the range of R versions you can switch between is very 
limited since the R <--> R.app interface has been changing.  For 
example, you cannot switch between any of 2.15.2, R-patched and R-devel, 
and AFAIR you cannot switch between 2.15.1 and 2.15.2.  Once 3.0.0 is 
out this should be stabler as now all of R.app is in the R.app sources 
and none in the R sources and it uses only API R headers.

I have a copy of the dmg, but not the sources, and I believe that Simon 
lost both when r.research.att.com got corrupted.

The sources are in
https://svn.rforge.net/osx/trunk/RSwitch

I have built a new binary and put in back, so the link should be working again.

Simon et al - in an effort to try and solve this issue, with nothing else open, I've started R.app.  I then open a script, type test<-1:10, cmd-rtn, and get some phantom text.  

I've then acquired the sysdiagnose_2013.01.18_15-48-08-CLST.tar.gz pile of stuff.  Do you think that any relevant info could be in here?  Does anyone have any ideas, in the wisdom if Unix, where to start looking? 

Thanks in advance.  Its quite an irritating little thing that I am sure has something to do with other programmes on my machine (I am using PERL, GNU parallel and various other unix software for genomics work (like samtools and requirements, etc). Short of deleting all of that stuff, I wonder if there is a way to see the activity.....

Thanks in advance.

Hi Andrew,

This issue I think have been coming up a few more times. Let me make sure we're seeing the same things.

You open R.app and then create a new document in the build-in editor. That's where you type 'test1<-1:10', followed by cmd-rtn.

You now see the 'test1' show up in the console, but only after you type the '<'. For every subsequent character you type in, 'test' is added (inserted really) into the console buffer.
Even if you delete a character, 'test1' is inserted once more.

Now, if you create a second line, say 'test2<-3:6', it continues to copy whatever is in front of the '<' on the 1st line in the file.

If you insert a blank (space) before the '<' on the 1st line, the problem is no longer there. Do you see the same behavior?

Maybe inserting a blank on the 1st line can be used as a workaround for now?

AFAICS this happens if you don't have anything defined in the editor window and start typing something like

a<
or
a== 

where "a" can be any identifier. It goes away the moment you have a function defined in the document.

Note that you can disable this by setting "Redirect stdout/err" to NO at the cost of no longer seeing any stdout/err in the console.

Unfortunately this is really hard to trace, because it is output that is somehow generated on stdout and then fed back to R, so tracing the output doesn't give you the source. My best attempt how to trace it is really going back in the GUI revisions to see where it started which is what I plan to do next (once I have a quiet minute) ...

Cheers,
Simon

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Phantom Text
Message-ID: <D62B47D5-DBF8-4054-8047-DCADFA2DDFFE@cardiff.ac.uk>

Hi

Regarding the phantom text problem I have had a poke around the subversion tree and found that the bug was introduced in the subversion commit from 28 August 2012 10:02:49 GMT+01:00.   Specifically the method:  - (void)textStorageDidProcessEditing:(NSNotification *)notification from RScriptEditorTextView was altered to comment out the if statement shown below which serves to interrupt the syntax highlighting on large text blocks to improve performance. 

		if([[theTextStorage string] length] > 120000) {
			breakSyntaxHighlighting = 1;
		}

The line below was then added presumably as a temporary test. 

breakSyntaxHighlighting = 1;

If the previous line is removed from the latest sources it eliminates the phantom text problem.   Although this appears to be the root of the problem I have not yet discovered why the first token parsed is emitted on stdout when this option is set, perhaps this indicates that there is another bug lurking somewhere.

Regards 

Joseph Coyle

Hi Joseph,

thanks for the effort!

Indeed, I found out that the syntax highlighting parser was responsible for this "phantom" text caused by an uncaught output of the underlying lex parser. Today I've already sent Simon my patch thus in the next release this "phantom" will disappear.

Cheers,
Hans

Yes, it's now committed and I can confirm that it fixes the issue. I have also committed the fix for startup drag'n'drop behavior. Both should be available in tomorrow's daily build (or you can get it form the SVN right now).

What do you think seq(1:10) does?  Add pointless typing strokes ....

This works on my machine: that suggests the problem is with the X11 
setup on your machine, maybe missing fonts given the traceback.  Please 
run this under a debugger to find out more.

You are apparently trying to install source packages, which is not the 
default on a CRAN build of R.  See Berend's reply.

See the 'R Installation and Administration Manual'.   Unfortunately you 
have not AFAICS told us your exact OS, but for Lion or Mountain Lion you 
need to install Xcode _and its command-line tools_ from the App Store.  See

http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-patched/R-admin.html#Installing-R-under-_0028Mac_0029-OS-X

and its footnotes.

And yes, this is in the Mac FAQ, e.g. at

I have been following the instructions on the Mac FAQ to unzip and install the downloaded packages using the command line but the results seem to indicate an error (they are installed but then don't work properly and so are subsequently uninstalled). It happens on more than one so that's why I thought it might be something generic I am doing. Here is a copy of the command line results:

Hi again,

It probably won't be of any help for now, but you might need it in the 
future: I used to install packages from the package installer. Then I 
realized that it often messed up with dependencies. That's why the best 
way to install packages and their dependencies on Mac is to run 
install.packages("package") in the console.

I hope you'll be able to fix your problem soon
Ivan

I notice there is a nice 'install dependencies' checkbox on the GUI package installer.  It has always worked for me.

It happened to me that when I clicked on the "install dependencies" 
checkbox, it basically installed every possible package. I remember it 
happened with doBy, where it installed tens of packages. The problem is 
likely because it installs the dependencies of the dependencies of the 
dependencies and so on. It might be fixed by now. But this has never 
happened with install.packages() so I don't try to use the package 
installer anymore.

The "install dependencies" checkbox sets the "dependencies" argument to TRUE in the install.packages command, so it is indeed recursive (which is the only coherent behaviour, I think).

> It happened to me that when I clicked on the "install dependencies" checkbox, it basically installed every possible package. I remember it happened with doBy, where it installed tens of packages. The problem is likely because it installs the dependencies of the dependencies of the dependencies and so on. It might be fixed by now. But this has never happened with install.packages() so I don't try to use the package installer anymore.

Never had this issue

If package A depends on B, and B depends on C, it seems logical that, to avoid breaking B, A depends on C as well. If the behaviour has changed it might be due to fewer dependencies in general.  In addition, unless you are using Raspberry PI, any modern hard drive (HDD or SSD) should be able to accommodate a non trivial percentage of all CRAN and Bioconductor packages without batting an eyelid.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] can't install R on a G5...
Message-ID: <51005270.9060205@libero.it>

hi to everybody :-)

I'm trying to install R on my PowerMac G5 (MacOS 10.5.8) but so far no 
success :-(
 From the CRAN I've downloaded version 2.15.0 (what looks me the last 
Universal version ready to install). Opened and installed (and deleted 
the 64 bit Intel only version) but R crashes as soon as it opens, with 
this error message:

I tried to install also gfortran-42-5577 but the installer stopped with 
this error message (partially translated by me from Italian, as only the

I checked and there's a folder in the Applications with this XCode 3.1.4

there's something missing? I've got this G5 2nd hand back in 2011, and 
unfortunately the Leopard dvd I've got can only install a previous 
(3.1.0 ... I guess, but I should check) version, and from the Apple

Any idea to get out? I must say I've also quite effortlessly installed R

the bigger screen...).
Sorry for the length of this mail :-)

You don't need that at all - in fact you don't need any of the gfortran above to run R - it's only needed if you want to install packages from sources that contain Fortran code and then gfortran 4.2.3 is enough.  If you just want to run R then the R*.pkg is all you need.

Unfortunately we don't have working G5 box anymore (the last one died which we had to pul the plug), so I can't check. But it seems as if you may have more recent non-ppc version installed as well so it prevents the older ppc-verison to install. Please run

file /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.15/Resources/lib/libR.dylib

You should see something like
$ file /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.15/Resources/lib/libR.dylib
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.15/Resources/lib/libR.dylib: Mach-O universal binary with 3 architectures
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.15/Resources/lib/libR.dylib (for architecture ppc7400):	Mach-O dynamically linked shared library ppc
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.15/Resources/lib/libR.dylib (for architecture x86_64):	Mach-O 64-bit dynamically linked shared library x86_64
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.15/Resources/lib/libR.dylib (for architecture i386):	Mach-O dynamically linked shared library i386

If not, try 
rm -rf /Library/Frameworks/R.framework
and re-installing R.

If all fails, run something like
curl http://r.research.att.com/R-2.15.0-leopard-universal.tar.gz | tar fvxz - -C /

which will simply put the framework in place.

Cheers,
Simon

It seems like you may have some broken Homebrew build of R or the components. Please try the CRAN R binary with Apple's X11.

Yes, that is the CRAN binary or R, but from your report you're using something else from Homebrew and that is likely what breaks. How exactly do you run X11 and R? Did you install anything from sources? Do you override any DYLD_* environment variables?

Yes, binary provided by CRAN's R-2.15.2.pkg comes with both quartz() and X11() devices. And make sure you run Apple's X11.app, not something provided by homebrew.

ok, what I see is this:

/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.15/Resources/lib/libR.dylib: 
Mach-O universal binary with 2 architectures
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.15/Resources/lib/libR.dylib

library x86_64
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.15/Resources/lib/libR.dylib 
(for architecture i386):	Mach-O dynamically linked shared library i386

As you see there are "2 architectures" instead of 3, and the 2nd line is 
missing.
What I should do next?
Thanks! :-)

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] poppler install, or alternatives
Message-ID: <C8C7C56D-F188-402A-8DFF-97A0D93EBE1E@illinois.edu>

I started to look around this morning for tools to read pdf in R
and came quickly to the tm package's readPDF function, which
relies on poppler.  At least on my mac

Platform: x86_64-apple-darwin9.8.0/x86_64 (64-bit)

./configure for poppler wanted pkg-config and ./configure for
pkg-config died with the following:

checking for GLIB... no
configure: error: Either a previously installed pkg-config or "glib-2.0 >= 2.16" could not be found. Please set GLIB_CFLAGS and GLIB_LIBS to the correct values or pass --with-internal-glib to configure to use the bundled copy.


at this point I got cold feet even though the pkg-config tarball shipped with a glib directory.
I wondered whether one of you could offer some advice about how to proceed.

Thanks
Roger

I thought ppc support was dropped altogether from R 2.15.0. Is that not correct?

ok, there's a way to uninstall all this stuff? Or I just leave it and 
forget?

ok, done it and now R opens regularly... I just have to start studying

Thanks Kjell,  all went smoothly -- for the close reading of the message, and for the "Coraggio!"
I needed both.

Maybe I'm missing something, but did you try something like
install.packages(c("Hmisc","acepack")) ?

I have been following the instructions on the Mac FAQ to unzip and install the downloaded packages using the command line but the results seem to indicate an error (they are installed but then don't work properly and so are subsequently uninstalled). It happens on more than one so that's why I thought it might be something generic I am doing. Here is a copy of the command line results:

I'm observing the same phenomenon. I'm using R.app GUI 1.53 (6335) 
x86_64-apple-darwin9.8.0 on 10.7.5. As far as I remember, it started when I 
last updated R. 

Sometimes it's particularly aggravating because it will generate more lines 
of text than my window can display, preventing me from seeing the output of 
the command. 

TIA

Hi Roger,

The error message is telling you that you can use the --with-internal-glib to tell pkg-config's configure script to use the included (presumably in the pkg-config tarball glib directory) glib.  Something like

cd pkg-config
./configure --with-internal-glib

should get you past this hurdle.

Hope that helps,
Kjell

Just a small followup; it's not necessary to use the GUI. I regularly
install packages with dependencies in R running in an xterm shell.
(Using X windows so that I can run R on remote linux machines, displaying
graphics back to my local desktop)

Very few, if any, CRAN packages need to be installed from source on a Mac.

Define "this stuff" ;). The GUI is simply the icon you see, so you "uninstall" it by moving it to Trash. This is true for almost all Mac apps.

R itself is in the R.framework so you move the framework to trash to delete it or use the rm -rf command below.

I was meaning the gfortran-4.2.3 and tcltk-8.5.5-x11 "stuff" you wrote 
it's useless unless I "want to install packages from sources that 
contain Fortran code", something I'm pretty sure I'll never do ;-)
Back to my question: there's a way to delete "this stuff, without using 
AppDelete :-P or I just forget them and let them occupy a tiny bit of my hd?

thanks
have a nice day

They are certainly tiny compared to today's disk sizes.

If I recall correctly
sudo gfortran-uninstall
will remove the Fortran

As for Tcl/Tk I don't think I added an uninstaller - it lives in /usr/local so if you don't use it, you can blow it away, otherwise you'd have to use pkgutil to get the content - probably not worth the hassle. Note that some packages on CRAN depend on tcltk so you may end up using it one way or another.

I have no idea what AppDelete does (the description sounds scary) but if it simply traverses pkgutil then it's certainly a misnomer and you're not deleting Apps here... ;)

Cheers,
Simon

1 This is not a mac question
2 You haven?t said what package you?re using
3. It is highly unlikely that the correct format is rtf.

The main SEM packages in R are OpenMx, SEM, and lavaan.

They all have tutorial pdfs, and examples of working models

Thanks Timothy, took on board your points and also adjusted/added a couple more variables. Reading okay. Will post on generic r forum in future. Will check out the tutorials file also.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Saving or copying graphics from Quartz returns empty
	file
Message-ID: <5102497202000007001E70AA@campusvs.weber.edu>


Hi, 
Can anyone suggest some help for saving or copying graphs I've created in the Quartz screen? I've read the R-FAQ and tried to search for answers, but have not found anything. I'm using a Mac, Mountain Lion OS, and have version 2.15.2 of R. 

When I save a graphic, the process either crashes R, or if it saves a file, when I open it I get a blank file or an error message that reads "The file Rplot.pdf could not be opened." When I try to copy the graphic instead to paste into any other program (Word, Excel, etc), a blank image frame is all I get. I have also tried running graphics and either saving or exporting from RStudio and have the same issues. 

I assume there is some package I've not loaded or some bug fix I need to get, but I can't find any documentation about it. Any ideas? 

Thanks, 
Heather Chapman

I'm getting this, too! 

It makes no difference to the running of software....I'd just like to know 
what it means.

I'm getting this, too! 

It makes no difference to the running of software....I'd just like to know 
what it means.

Cheers

I don't know the cause of the problem you're seeing, but I generally 
recommend to people that they generate graphs in the final format, 
rather than saving them from some other format.

In your case, that would mean working out the code to make your plot 
look good on screen, then redo it all directly to the pdf device, by 
simply wrapping the code in

pdf(file="foo.pdf")
  ... your code to draw the plot ...
dev.off()

This is preferable because the graphics system makes some choices 
(spacing, etc.) based on the characteristics of the output device; if 
you copy from a screen device to a print device, those
choices may be different.

The easiest WYSIWYG way is to use

quartz.save("foo.pdf","pdf")

which works in the R.app GUI.

Nonetheless, copy/paste works as well although it uses a different way. If we are to look into that, can you tell us exactly what OS version are you on and provide sessionInfo() to have an idea about your setup?

Cheers,
Simon

It was an unsolicited lexer output and it has been fixed in the meantime. Please upgrade your GUI from

In R-devel (3.0.0-to-be) it also works in command-line R.

I took this to mean 'Save' from the quartz() device menu, which works 
for me (on Lion and ML).

Even if Heather is using a suboptimal way to export graphics, it still shouldn't crash R though. Heather, if this is in any way reproducible, please include the code that causes the crash. Also, run R from the terminal with "--vanilla" option when reproducing if possible (to ensure a clean session), and include the output after the crash. (E.g., "Segmentation fault", or whatever it may be.)

Surely though one may have to do quite a bit of tinkering
to get pdf output that looks exactly like the quartz output.
The result for dev.copy() or quartz.save() is generally 
fairly close.  

From that point of view, it would be useful (save a few clicks) 
to be able to plot pdf of jpeg output directly to the screen.
Or is there a way to do that, short of printing to a file that is
already open in Preview.

Message-ID: <64FC5841-7131-456C-97A8-EF0BA6908AE7@plessthan.com>

R 2.15.2
OS X ML

Colleagues,

I am "sink"ing output from statistical tests to a text file:
	sink(FILENAME)
	SOMETEST()
	sink()

When I open the file with TextEdit, the output from lm() contains:
	Signif. codes: 0 ?***? 0.001 ?**? 0.01 ?*? 0.05 ?.? 0.1 ? ? 1 

When I open the identical file in Word (2008), that same text appears as:
	Signif. codes:  0 ???***??? 0.001 ???**??? 0.01 ???*??? 0.05 ???.??? 0.1 ??? ??? 1 
When Word opens, it asks about the selection of encoding for the file.  I tried a number of options and all lead to the same distorted text.

Any idea how to resolve this (other than to ignore Word!)?

Heve you tried opening the file in TextEdit, save it, and open it in Word after?

Looks like the directional quotes are messing you up.

Modify your code to use:

  options(useFancyQuotes = FALSE)

before you use sink().

Also, you could use:

  options(show.signif.stars = FALSE)

to suppress the inclusion of the significance stars, which I have in my .Rprofile file.

Something like this might help:

    Sys.setlocale(category = "LC_ALL", locale = "C")
 

check
  Sys.getlocale()
beforehand.
