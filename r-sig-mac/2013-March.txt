Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] issues with browseEnv, drag & drop
Message-ID: <ED97024A-85A4-45BD-88A6-38B925855D32@ualberta.ca>

Hi - 

I'm not sure that this is precisely a Mac issue, but in a fresh install of R 2.15.2, I get the error:

Error in browseEnv(html = F) : could not find function "invsible"

whenever I open the workspace browser from the menu bar. This seems to be a typo on line 152 of browseEnv. If this is a bug, I can't understand why no one else has noticed; on the other hand, if this is a problem with my install or setup, I'm at a loss to understand what is wrong. Sample output below.

Also, the R for Mac FAQ says, "Drag and drop of a directory on the R.app icon while R.app is not running will start R.app and set the working directory. By default .RData and the history file (default name .Rapp.history) are fetched from this working directory." However, my tests don't seem to confirm this ? the workspace is loaded but not the history file. Am I doing something wrong?

They did notice: it was corrected in R-patched months ago, and R 2.15.3 
is now out with the corrected version.

There are changes in that area, so please try 2.15.3.

Preamble: There is a dedicated R-Mac-SIG list where this would have been more appropriately directed. and followups should be directed there (and the R-help address removed so we do not have two simulatnaous threads.)

There have been several updates to the R.app that went with R 2.15.0 that should not be at all disruptive to acquire. R.app version numbers are not in sync with R versions so that doesn't tell us what R.app you have. This is the current R.app (based on what is at the r.research.att.com website) : Mac OS X GUI rev. 6451

What is your "home directory" and does your understanding agree with what you see when you use the Preferences panel from within a running version of R.app?

I'm also running OSX 10.6.8, but R version 2.15.2 (2012-10-26) Platform: x86_64-apple-darwin9.8.0/x86_64 (64-bit). Looking at the Get Info panel for the GUI I see I am also somewhat out-of-date: R.app GUI 1.53 (6335 Leopard build 64-bit).

I noticed that R 2.15.3 is now available. (I had been checking over the last several days and this is the first time I noticed that it had appeared.)

Could there be another .Profile file? (They are invisible by default in the MacOS using Finder.app.)

Message-ID: <CAPUB6NBrLm7rt4T96yB1EFdaiOed5YocH82AnkRDS+xbeWafzA@mail.gmail.com>

I'm subscribing to R-devel, where may be the proper place to post this
query. Sorry.

I have a reason to create R from the source code. I have a MacBook Pro
running OS X 10.8.2. I've downloaded 'gfortran-4.2.3.pkg' and
installed Fortran.

I downloaded R-2.15.3 and tried to do a "./configure".

The configure fails and the error messages I'm seeing are:

checking for dummy main to link with Fortran 77 libraries... none
checking for Fortran 77 name-mangling scheme... unknown
configure: WARNING: unknown Fortran name-mangling scheme
checking whether gfortran appends underscores to external names... unknown
configure: error: cannot use Fortran

I've read the admin manual.

My Mac system is vanilla, so I had been hoping that I'd have no
difficulty generating R but unfortunately I was wrong. Can someone
suggest something for me to try?

Thanks.

I suspect you forgot to set -arch and the architecture of your fortran and gcc doesn't match. Please see the Mac FAQ and use the proper flags or update your Fortran (so you have a 64-bit driver as well).

Dear Dan,

You also have to install X11 and Tcl/Tk for X-Windows. The R Commander
installation notes at
<http://socserv.socsci.mcmaster.ca/jfox/Misc/Rcmdr/installation-notes.html>
have detailed instructions for various versions of Mac OS X. (You can
disregard the part about installing the Rcmdr package if you're not
interested in that.)

I hope this helps,
 John

Sorry, I lied when I said this was a totally vanilla machine. I had

For windows, really?

Are you sure I have to install tcl/tk on my mac? capabilities() says
TRUE for tcltk.

Sorry, didn't see the "X-".

Your instructions worked well. Installing the tcltk package did the trick.

Pelase do NOT install R-devel from the nightly build pages. It should not have been there to start with - that's now fixed.

Actually, I installed a version of R-devel (now R-alpha) that I had
downloaded from the nightly build pages several days ago.

Message-ID: <A0A8129DA7EE1E49B7F6BB09FBA32A180DC3DCC3@MLBXV08.nih.gov>

I think I've identified a bug. When I drag a text file into an edit window in R.app, sometimes the resulting inserted path and filename appear before the last character, even if the last character is not a newline. 

Thanks for taking a look.

To replicate:
new window
type only the following. do not follow with a newline
df=read.table(
drag a text file into window after "df=read.table("

result:
df=read.table\path\filename(

My config:
R version 2.15.2 (2012-10-26) -- "Trick or Treat"
R.app GUI 1.53 (6443) x86_64-apple-darwin9.8.0

Also happens on a current version in R 2.15.3

[R.app GUI 1.53 (6451) x86_64-apple-darwin9.8.0]


And thinking maybe I could fix it by starting with:

df=read.table("

... It now drops the filename between the paren and the dbl-quote. I had not ever seen this because I drop my file names into the session first and then build my commands around them.

When I use the R.app GUI, underlined text produced by help(?, help_type = "text") appears as

_^Ht_^He_^Hx_^Ht

If you choose an external editor (in the Editor Preferences panel), you get whatever display style that editor executes for highlighted/underlined text. Textwrangler.app will display it with interspersed underline characters.

Message-ID: <0F6840674E5745FD93399BD01C328546@gmail.com>

I installed the OSX R-devel 3.0 build, in pkg format, today from here:

http://r.research.att.com/#nightly


> sessionInfo()
R version 3.0.0 alpha (2013-03-15 r62270)

loaded via a namespace (and not attached):

I can no longer start R, except through Rstudio (and I don't know why Rstudio works). From the command line, I get:

$ which R
/usr/bin/R



$ R
/usr/bin/R: line 236: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/etc/x86_64/ldpaths: No such file or directory


$ /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/bin/R64

$ ls /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/etc/
Renviron javaconf ldpaths repositories



So indeed, the directory is missing.

I am running the latest version of OSX, 10.8.3 (12D78).

What's the "right" way to fix this?

Thanks,
Richard

The postflight installation script breaks it.  This has been reported: 
you need either to install from the sources or wait for tomorrow.

As Brian said, this is known and fixed. The current build is up now.

Note that at this point this is mainly for package developers so they can compile and test their packages. If you are a user, you probably want to wait another day or two, because the package binaries are still in the process of being built and we are still ironing out some quirks associated with the switch form multi-arch to single-arch and the target OS upgrade.

Thanks,
Simon

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] R 3.0.0 beta
Message-ID: <51497FF7.3090306@stats.ox.ac.uk>

R 3.0.0 is due to be released on Apr 3, and is now in beta.  Simon is 
travelling but before he left put up a binary distribution at 
http://r.research.att.com/snowleopard/R-3.0-branch/R-3.0-branch-snowleopard-signed.pkg 
.   A high proportion of CRAN is available as binary packages, and we 
will improve that over the next two weeks.

UseRs and especially package developers are encouraged to try this out. 
  For CRAN packages there are logs available at 
http://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_NAME.html (replace 
NAME by the name of your package).

Note that there are quite a few changes in this pre-release:

- it requires Snow Leopard or later.

- it is x86_64 only and sub-architectures are not used.

- the recommended compilers have changed and the CRAN distribution uses 
rather specific names for them to make it easier to match them.  Those 
compilers need Xcode 4.2 or later and (if relevant) a Fortran compiler 
from http://r.research.att.com.  Note that the binary is set up for the 
matching gfortran for 10.6: if you have Lion or Mountain Lion you will 
need to edit FLIBS in etc/Makeconf.

- the relevant manuals are part of the distribution, or see 
http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-devel/R-admin.html, especially 
chapter 4 and sections 6.3.2 and C.4.

I've reported most of the issues thrown up with CRAN packages to their 
maintainers.  Common issues are

- including headers such as R.h which have #defines before system 
headers and/or without R_NO_REMAP or similar (see 'Writing R Extensions').

- misuse of 'inline' in C code: only 'static inline' is really portable.

- lack of care with OpenMP: the CRAN distribution does not support 
OpenMP and this toolchain has flaky OpenMP support.

Note too that checking with clang (at least the version in Xcode 4.6) 
rather than gcc shows up further problems: the R-admin manual shows you 
how to set that up for yourself.

I have heard rumors of GCC 4.7.2, has this been abandoned?

At least for 3.0.0.  It did not work well enough.

A more likely move is to clang.  Clearly that has a future whereas 
Apple's port of gcc does not.  However, R package writers seem beloved 
of g++'s lack of C++ standards conformance, and quite a high proportion 
of C++-using packages do not compile with clang++ (nor the Solaris CC).

Prof Ripley,

If you don't mind public speculation, what would the supported Fortran
compiler be? gfortran 4.7.* or an LLVM project? (Is there a Fang
project?)

Some version of gfortran.  For 3.0.0 we are using the same compilers as 
used for 2.15.x (they depend on the version of OS X, hence the plural).

Note that llvm-gcc and DragonEgg both have Fortran front-ends with LLVM 
back-ends, but they are versions of gfortran and Apple supports neither.

Prof Ripley,

A quick note to indicate that it appears that the primary 'tests' directory, which contains the code and related files for running tools::testInstalledBasic() is not present in the current OSX binary package for 3.0.0 beta (http://r.research.att.com/snowleopard/R-3.0-branch/R-3.0-branch-snowleopard-signed.pkg).

As a consequence, the following fails:

> testInstalledBasic("both")
Error in setwd(file.path(R.home(), "tests")) : 
  cannot change working directory

with the missing directory being:

> file.path(R.home(), "tests")
[1] "/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/tests"


Similarly, it seems that the individual 'tests' directories, where appropriate, for base and recommended packages (used via tools::testInstalledPackages()) are also not present in the current OSX beta binary package.

I presume that this may have been inadvertent in the preparation of this build prior to Simon's departure.

Beyond that, I also wanted to note and say thanks (Fritz?) for modifying Sweave so that the output now includes the line number for the chunk being processed. A major help for debugging.

Regards,

Marc Schwartz

Prof Ripley,

I highly appreciated the clarifications in this thread.  I am sure I
am not the only one.

Good luck with finding a new compiler; I am happy to provide whatever
help I can.

Best,
Kasper

Yes, the build just did make install and not install-tests, now fixed. Also there was a crontab hiccup so hopefully nightlies will be showing up as before.

Thanks for the update Simon. I will re-try with an updated binary build as soon as I get a chance.

It is very much not the correct place to post this. There is no Mac-spcific content and there is a mixed-models mailing list wher ethis would be completely appropriate. You should do the necessary subscription and reading of their FAQ before re-posting.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Local source pkg interacts strangely with sessionInfo,
	causing R to crash
Message-ID: <4EC6BA68-C64A-4DB7-8797-840D2C25E561@depauw.edu>

I'm not sure if this is an Rgui issue or Mac only issue, or an R 3.0.0 RC problem, or a problem with the pkg.   I'll start here.

I am updating my package ChemoSpec to work with R 3.0.0  With the following sessionInfo I can install the old version of ChemoSpec from a CRAN repos and it works fine:

[R.app GUI 1.60 (6457) x86_64-apple-darwin10.8.0]

> sessionInfo()
R version 3.0.0 RC (2013-03-27 r62426)
Platform: x86_64-apple-darwin10.8.0 (64-bit)

Now I have an updated local source package of ChemoSpec which builds and checks fine.  If I install it via the gui or command line, I can do library("ChemoSpec") just fine.  But if I do ?ChemoSpec, R or Rgui just wanders off with the pinwheel of death and must be force quitted.  That's not the best clue.  If I do sessionInfo() before library("ChemoSpec") sessionInfo() works fine.  If I do sessionInfo() after library("ChemoSpec"), R or Rgui crashes.  I suspect it might be Rgui as because the crash occurs the moment I type the first '(' so it seems to occur when the gui is adding the ')' - notice that the crash info is printed before my sessionInfo command is echoed to the gui.  The crash report is below.  Suggestions most appreciated.  Bryan

tcltk currently doesn't work with the R GUI. It seems to be a problem with the native Tcl/Tk libraries in OS X. In previous version we used X11 instead - if we won't find a way to fix this, we'll probably revert to the X11 version.

Simon

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Compiling R-packages on Mac
Message-ID: <1540BC57-CFF4-4FE4-B0CC-25ED1AAA251C@uni-tuebingen.de>

Hello ALL!
I am a newbie on Mac, with long Linux experience (Ubuntu, than Debian, finally Fedora, for many years). R on Mac is very pleasant and works nicely. However, I noticed something strange, while I was trying to compile a package on which my research team is working. Briefly, I could compile/install the package via R interface, but not in console mode (terminal). It seems that some low-level stuffs are missing, like gfortran and the like. Now, I wonder how it is possible to compile the package successfully via R IDE, but not in terminal, with R CMD INSTALL xyz?

Also, if I miss something which is not there by default, and provided by Xcode, how to get that? Should I use Mac Ports? Homebrew? Or via packages on this site <http://hpc.sourceforge.net/index.php>?

Please, help me with this? I am worried that PATHs are not nicely lined up and integrated in my Mac OS X?

Best,
PM

None of them - they won't work. Install Fortran from CRAN
http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools/

Also make sure you have Xcode Command Line Tools installed.

Are you using MacPort or similar? They may be messing up your system - make sure you are not on your PATH.
At any rate, for more specific help, please include exact output of the failures you see.

Cheers,
Simon

But where did the local binaries come from if you can't build them?
Perhaps a $PATH issue, but I'd be quite surprised if R.app had a
different path than the plain R executable.

Perhaps the following will help

echo $PATH

from the terminal and Sys.getenv("PATH") from within R. If you can
narrow it down to what tool in particular is failing, comparing the
output of `which` and Sys.which() might be more direct.

Finally, the traceback of the failed build perhaps and the exact
install.packages() command you used.

Yes, sorry if that wasn't clear. Simon is the official R-on-Mac "guy"
(though certainly not the only one of R Core to use it) and provides
the official binaries. You can probably get away with using Mac Ports
or Homebrew or whatnot, but if it doesn't work and you need help, be
prepared to be told to use the officially supported tools.

You *really* do need to tell us the version of R and of OS X (they do 
matter, and are asked for in the posting guide).  I suggest that today 
you start with R 3.0.0 RC, and read the appropriate R-admin manual, 
which is pretty much the same as 
http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-devel/R-admin.html and ships with R.

That manual tells you exactly what you need.  There are other ways, but 
don't ask for help until you have tried the official way.  And note that 
the recommended gfortran defaults to i386, so '-arch x86_64' is essential.

BTW, there are lots of tools you need on Linux not part of a basic

No you can't (at least not for HPC, Fink, MacPorts) - they don't have Apple compiler drivers. If you want to use those, you'll have to compile R yourself using their tools.  (I'm not 100% about Homebrew, because they apparently use our compilers as I learden from the storm of e-mails when we had server issues ;)) You'll have to pick the world you want to live in - either native OS X + CRAN (supported by us) or one of the parallel universes like MacPorts, Fink etc. (supported by them, not us). But as Brian, said, reading the manuals is a good start (and FWIW, if you downloaded R from CRAN, you did see the link pointing you to the tools).

Cheers,
Simon

I've just installed R-3.0.0 RC.
I noticed that tcl/tk 8.6 was installed in /local.
Shouldn't this be /usr/local?

Can I just remove /local?

Yes, and has been reported.

Not if you want to use package tcltk.  Copy it over /usr/local.

Hi,

Just installed from http://R.research.att.com/ and the R.app was not
installed in /Applications.  The install was otherwise successful as
I can run from Terminal

sessionInfo()
R version 3.0.0 RC (2013-03-30 r62448)
Platform: x86_64-apple-darwin10.8.0 (64-bit)

locale:

attached base packages:
[1] stats     graphics  grDevices utils     datasets  methods   base

I tried to install R.app separately from the link lower down on
the page but it brings me to a Not Found page.

Thanks.

best,

Note that R.app is installed wherever you point the installer to - it is relocatable. So please check that you selected the default "for all users" or the proper Applications folder. Otherwise you'll have to check the location you installed R.app into. (BTW: what OS X are you on? You didnt' tell us)

Sorry.  This is a snow leopard computer.  I was trying it out here before going on to one with Lion. 
I'll look around some more and try reinstalling to verify and will get back to you if I don't succeed. Thank you.

R.app crashes when accessing R..Preferences..Startup

Is there something wrong with my installation, or is it a bug?

Hi David:
I installed R 2.15.3 and I also looked for another .Rprofile file using the find unix, but could not find one.  It only returned the file in my root directory (~/users/simon/.rprofile). But as I noted in my earlier  post, the contents of .rprofile is *different* from what R is picking up. I have the feeling that it is picking up another file, but for the life of me I cannot find it. I tried searching in the R home directory (via R.home()) but it's not there either.  How do I find this other .rprofile file?

Found it. The old list of functions that used to be found in the .rprofile file had actually been written to the .rdata workspace in my user root directory.  
Sorry. Problem solved.
Thank you for your assistance.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Cannot install packages after update
Message-ID: <CAJESSmZoZPy+HW2xNXb48ud-1LhPMX2pBAhM4C+nYE76=e6ZiA@mail.gmail.com>

Hallo Everybody

I fear I may have broken something. I tried to use firefox as my help
browser in Rstudio becuase the help window is really small. I tried
options(browser = "/Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox")
but that didn't work. Thereafter I couldn't use my help window in R
studio from here on. I updated R and R studio. When I click on the
Packages & Data menu item in the (normal) R Gui I get the following:
Error in readRDS(file) :
  ReadItem: unknown type 32, perhaps written by later version of R

If I try to use the package installer and check for packages I get:
Warning: unable to access index for repository
http://cran.za.r-project.org/bin/macosx/leopard/contrib/2.15

I cannot do ity from the consule either:
> install.packages("plyr", lib="/Users/christiaanpauw/Library/R/2.15/library")
Warning: unable to access index for repository
http://cran.za.r-project.org/bin/macosx/leopard/contrib/2.15

I am almost certain the problem started when I broke the browser
option: I couldnot find the correct option for Mac anywhere
it is currently set to
> options("browser")
$browser
[1] "/usr/bin/open"
in RGui and :
> options("browser")
$browser
function (url)
{
    .Call("rs_browseURL", url)
}
<environment: 0x100a0c028>
in Rstudio

Does anyone have an idea how to fix this?

Thanks in advance
Christiaan
