The version to be posted later today has a native RGtk that works,
sort of. The version to be posted next week has working versions
of RGtkConsole, RGtkScrollPane, RGtkViewers. This allows you
to write portable GUI applications, with a richer widget set than
Tk, showing up as Aqua on the Mac.

I am still struggling with gtkDevice (has some hardcoded X11)
and with  Rggobi (relies on case sensitivity in build process).
There is a native graphview, but basically what we need is
a framework version of that.

?!?!!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?

WOW!

it would be very awesome to have a distribution kit with all of this built
in.... it could make our R installs onto lab machines much simpler :)
[I've wanted to get some Rggobi support for a while now...]

What Gtk library did you use? Did you really test it? I compiled a 
"native" version using Gtk+OSX a while ago (a month or so). After some 
patching it compiled, but not all widgets really work (e.g. the project 
pursuit control panel is almost empty). I have a X11 build with static 
Gtk+ (i.e. no need to install Gtk+ libraries and mess up your system) 
... that one works fine (well, modulo bugs in ggobi itself ;)).

BTW: Where did you get the sources? CVS was on franz (and therefore 
it's gone) and the latest release is more than a year old - is there a 
way to get the most recent CVS somehow? (except for mailing to certain 
folks ;)).

Cheers,
Simon

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] R-devel with some Gtk
Message-ID: <5BD9A552-B5B8-11D8-837E-000393BB6D36@stat.ucla.edu>

The new version of R-devel on http://gifi.stat.ucla.edu/pub has
binaries for about 480 packages. It includes native versions
of RGtk and some of its friends (RGtkConsole, RGtkViewers,
RGtkScrollPane), which allow you to write portable GUI R
applications (with the Aqua look on OS X). The caveat is that
both RGtk and the GTK+OSX frameworks are still incomplete, so
some widgets are inevitably missing.

Observe that this version has no support for X11, uses Aqua
Tcl/Tk, and is intended to be used from either Terminal.app
or Emacs.app, and not from R.app.

Perhaps this is a silly question for the lis, but I can't seem to get  
rpy  ( http://rpy.sourceforge.net)  fully working with this version of  
R.  some basic functions work, but little else.

When I try to import the rpy module in python I get the following error.
		
		>>> from rpy import *
		Error in dyn.load(x, as.logical(local), as.logical(now)) :
	        		unable to load shared library  
"/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.0.0/Resources/library/ 
stats/libs/stats.so":
		  dlcompat: dyld: python can't open library: libR.dylib  (No such  
file or directory, errno = 2)
		Error in dyn.load(x, as.logical(local), as.logical(now)) :
		        unable to load shared library

		  dlcompat: dyld: python can't open library: libR.dylib  (No such  
file or directory, errno = 2)
		In addition: Warning message:
		package stats in options("defaultPackages") was not found


but some commands still work such as
		>>> r.seq(1,10)
		[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

but if I try to do anything fancier, I get errors and if I try to load  
a library it crashes.

In the README for rpy it tells me I need to build R with the following
configure option    '--enable-R-shlib

I am not at all sure what this means, should I download the source and  
just rebuild R locally?

Any help or clarification would be fantastic.
thanks in advance

I downloaded it from rpy.sourceforge.net and just did a
'python setup.py install'
I am running 10.3.4 with the installed apple python and a few extra  
modules (PyX, PyObjC, Twisted, etc)

Thanks

Hi, I managed to get it working, although I think I may have used some  
hideous hack.
I made an alias (using the finder) to libR.dylib from the  
/library/frameworks/r.framework/ and replaced the one in /usr/local/lib
this managed to change my error messages to the following
	
			Error in dyn.load(x, as.logical(local), as.logical(now)) :
       				  unable to load shared library  
"/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.0.0/Resources/library/ 
stats/libs/stats.so":
				  dlcompat: dyld: python truncated or malformed library:  
/usr/local/lib/libR.dylib (file is empty)
			Error in dyn.load(x, as.logical(local), as.logical(now)) :
  			      	  unable to load shared library  
"/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.0.0/Resources/library/ 
methods/libs/methods.so":
				  dlcompat: dyld: python truncated or malformed library:  
/usr/local/lib/libR.dylib (file is empty)
			In addition: Warning message:
			package stats in options("defaultPackages") was not found

Then I just copied the entire libR.dylib file from the R.framework/lib  
directory to /usr/local/lib
now, it seems to work flawlessly. Although I am worried that I may have  
done something terrible.

This helped me out, maybe some other new users will find it helpful.
thanks

Easier solution should be to just append 
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/bin to DYLIB_LIBRARY_PATH 
(see the R shell script).
Usually it's a better idea to modify the library path than to copy 
things ... but I don't have rpy here - it's just a general advice ;).

oops, that should read DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH of course ... (see "man dyld" )

from the POV of a "traditional unix user", this is 100% expected behavior.

folks are probably better off learning enough of the vi commandset to
cope, rather than using workarounds... it pays off in the long run.

Actually, no. The expected UNIX behavior is to open whatever editor you 
tell it to open. Claiming that people should 'cope' with vi is missing 
the point (and besides, the default editor is totally arbitrary. Linux 
happens to use 'vi' most everywhere, but a different UNIX could dump 
you out into 'ed' just as easily. There's no inherent advantage to 
knowing 'vi' except the prevalence of Linux systems).

Emacs users may find it better to set that as the default.
I do use ess, but also from time to time, I run R from the
command line because I want it to start quickly to do
something simple.

I have successfully installed RCocoaGUI on two machines (running 
10.3.3). I really enjoy working in this environment and I thank Simon 
and Stefano.

However, I did have problems installing it on a new PowerBook running 
10.3.4 as did a colleague running 10.3.4 on a Cube. R.app 1.9.0 
installs ok, but the installation of RCocoaGUI does not. It appear to 
work, but the old Carbon GUI starts when the R icon is double clicked.

If any information is available, please let me know.

Thanks,

Jim

Hi there.... is the current best approach for getting the current 
release of 1.9.1 to update /Library/Frameworks/ with R.framework.tgz 
from http://www.economia.unimi.it/R?  Or is a bundled disk image to be 
expected soon on mirrors (no pressure on the busy people who actually 
make all of this available!)?

Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.58.0406292041130.1972@unix33.alpha.wehi.edu.au>

Hi,

I have an R-Tcl/Tk application and I do most of my testing on
Windows and Linux, but I am presenting a workshop soon for which
participants will need to install the software on their own
laptops beforehand, and I may get some installation questions
from MacOS X users.  I was just hoping to check on this list
whether the strategy I used to install my R package and its
requirements on MacOS X last year (with R 1.7.0) is still
appropriate for 1.9.x.

My main question is this:  Does the latest R for MacOS X
work better with X11 Tcl/Tk than Aqua Tcl/Tk?  Or, put another
way, is one easier to install than the other?  From memory, X11
was preferred for 1.7.0 (the last R for OS X version I tried).
My R-Tcl/Tk package requires the BWidget and TkTable extensions.
BWidget contains only Tcl scripts (no shared libraries/compiled
code) so it is very easy to install, but TkTable has a compiled
shared library, so it is very important that users know whether
they have an Aqua version (e.g. from TclTkAquaBI) or an X11
version.  I have built an X11 version at:
http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/limmaGUI/Tktable2.8MacOSX_X11.zip

Best regards,
James

The official R-1.9.x for OS X from CRAN or Stefano's
site requires the X11 version of Tcl/Tk. So you have
X11 widgets in your Tcl/Tk windows, while R is running
in R.app. You cannot get Quartz graphics from Terminal.app
or Emacs.app.

My unofficial R-devel on http://gifi.stat.ucla.edu/pub uses
Aqua Tcl/Tk. It uses  a rather nasty hack to provide Quartz
from Terminal.app and Emacs.app. You
cannot use packages such as tkrplot, which depends
explicitly on X11s. It also implies
that if you have a package that loads a
shared library into Tcl/Tk, then that shared library
should be a dynamic library and not a bundle
(that's the way Aqua Tcl/Tk is set up). It does not
work well with R running in R.app.

So, on balance, I think you should go with the
official X11 version and live with the ugliness
until R-core fixes the eventloop problem.

Jan,

Thanks-very much for your reply.  I'll definitely advise 
MacOS X participants in our microarray workshop to use X11 
Tcl/Tk, i.e. I'll tell them NOT TO install the 
Tktable extension from TclTkAquaBI, but to instead INSTALL IT 
FROM http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/limmaGUI/

My R-Tcl/Tk GUI does use tkrplot quite a lot, so it is limited 
to X11 at the moment, but I will add an option soon, so that the 
user can choose between tkrplot and the regular R graphics 
device for all plots.

One thing I have in my tkrplot windows is a File menu with 
options to save the plot as PNG, JPEG, PDF etc.  Rgui in Windows 
provides this automatically when using the regular R graphics 
device.  On Linux/X11, things are a bit more complicated because 
of the difference between png() and bitmap().  png() should 
work as long as you have a valid DISPLAY for X11, but I 
seem to remember having problems at some stage with my 
R-Tcl/Tk GUI with png() on Linux/X11 so I switched to 
bitmap(), which creates PNGs indirectly via ghostscript, 
so they don't looks as good, but they can be created 
without an X11 DISPLAY.  (But then how could I have 
been running R-Tcl/Tk without a valid X11 DISPLAY???)

I suppose on MacOS X, png() etc. should always work.

I've just asked my administrator to install R 1.9.1 on a Mac, 
so I guess I'll soon find out how this issue (of being able to 
easily save PNGs etc.) compares between tkrplot and the regular 
graphics device for my R-Tcl/Tk GUI running in R 1.9.1 on 
MacOS X.

Regards,
James

Hi.

I'm wondering if anyone has tried to/used R with Xgrid. If so, I'd be
interested to hear any tips anyone might have about making this work
(using either clusters of OS X machines or clusters of Linux/Solaris/OS X
machines).

I'd also be interested to hear if people think that Xgrid would be better
than one of the other extant parallel-R options out there (like Rmpi or
one of the other ones).

Thanks!

not yet.  we're waiting for a lab full of g5 hardware to arrive.  our g4's
are too slow (dual 533 and 733mhz machines) for the tasks that we'd like
to carry out.

it almost certainly depends on what you're doing and how much programmer
time you're willing to invest.  look at the ParallelR pages, and
especially the rscalapack stuff.  high level, lets you do factor analysis
and principle components analysis on a cluster.

Have you tried Quantian?  bootable linux cd images of R and related
stuff...

Dirk (the quantian packager) , are you on this list?  :)
