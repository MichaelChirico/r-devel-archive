I wonder if anybody has successfully got the RMySQL installation  
working?

I have followed the instructions (both approaches) given on the build  
failure CRAN site but still get a configuration error.

    The "libz" library is required by the MySQL client library

    Make sure you have "libz" installed properly and/or included
    in your $LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  Perhaps it is not in any of the
    standard directories (e.g., /usr/lib/, /usr/local/lib)?

A similar error message is produced on my MacBook Pro running R 2.4.0.

Unfortunately I still have no access to a Mac Pro machine, so I can't  
test it. In theory it should work as there is no problem building 64- 
bit ppc binary (i.e. the R sources should have no 32-bit vs 64-bit  
issues on a Mac). In practice there may be some problems lurking in  
the dark because of the compilers (the gcc 4.0.3 we use for the  
current build doesn't have 64-bit Intel support). A possible way is  
to use Apple compiler and maybe HPC gfortran. I can try to build such  
binary, but I'll need some owner of Mac Pro to test it (I'll post it  
to the R Mac page). Of course the same restrictions that apply to the  
ppc 64-bit version apply here as well (no Cocoa and GUI, need for  
custom X11 client etc.).

Cheers,
Simon

Ricardo,

What does your /users/rrodriguez/Desktop/mysql-5.0.27 directory look
like?  Can you find the libmysqlclient anywhere using
Spotlight/find/locate...?

my lib directory put down by the MySQL binary install (I **think** it
was a binary install - my only mac at the moment is a weak ibook, that
takes so long to compile anything on I don't usually bother) looks
like:

[veblen:~] jryan% ls /usr/local/mysql/lib
libdbug.a               libmysqlclient.a        libmysys.a
libmygcc.a              libmysqlclient_r.a      libz.a
libmysql.imp            libmystrings.a

Actually now that I think of it I may have been using the DarwinPorts
version - though it really shouldn't matter at this stage - that would
be another error if there was some sort of compat problem.

if you can locate it - use the export procedure as you did before -
only point to the directory that you find it in.  You may need to
build it from scratch.  Like I said previously, NOTHING has caused me
more headaches than getting RMySQL to build.

Keep us posted.
Jeff

R as is just great for me. I also use Stata 9 which is also a great  
environment. I'm not a statistician. I will be in the market for a  
new computer in January, and our data sets are getting very large-- 
microarrays. Certainly, R has much more development via Bioconductor  
in this area. But I think it will be interesting to compare  
performance on something like the pending 8 cpu Mac Pro with the  
multiple CPU 64 bit version of Stata (only a grant can afford that),  
with R. So here's my question. Is R already capable of taking  
advantage of more than one core?

Using SNOW, or MPI, or some careful batch programming to split up your 
tasks across CPUs - yes.

This is the same sort of thing you'd likely face in Stata -- unless 
they've invested a HUGE amount of effort in making threaded/parallelized 
computations "easier".

generally it makes the most sense to leave those optimizations to 
the person running the statistics - they're in a place to 
understand where to optimize things for their problem set.

Yes, the CRAN R binary build for Macs uses vecLib which uses multiple  
cores (since OS X 10.4.8), so for operations involving BLAS you get  
parallelization for free. R doesn't use any other means of  
parallelization internally. As of using R for parallel computing, as  
Elijah was pointing out you may want to use snow (snow+rpvm is  
available in binary form from CRAN).

Your question didn't involve 64-bit, but your subject suggests so -  
there is currently no 64-bit Intel binary of R available from CRAN,  
but an experimental build is likely to appear soon.

Simon

It turns out that they have.  This is made easier for them by the 
relatively limited data model, but it is still pretty impressive.
The Stata people really do have a clue, surprising as this seems when you 
first look at their macro language (and even that improves on further 
consideration)

Thanks for the responses from each of you. So I can expect to take  
advantage of Mac OS X 10.5 next year, in terms of both 64 bit and  
multiple cores, with R. Good. I won't worry about buying any  
particular configuration then.

I'm glad to report that 64-bit R compiles and passes make check on  
Mac Pro (thanks to Jan de Leeuw for providing me with access to his  
machine).

Quick guide:
- get gfortran 4.2.0 for Intel from HPC pages (http:// 
hpc.sourceforge.net/) and install it ( sudo tar fvxz gfortran-intel- 
bin.tar.gz -C /
- get Darwin driver for gfortran (e.g. from my pages, run in terminal:
sudo bash
cd /usr/local/bin
mv gfortran i686-apple-darwin8-gfortran-4.2.0
curl -O http://r.research.att.com/gfortran
chmod a+x gfortran

Add the compiler to your PATH

export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH

get R sources, configure and build. For my test I used the following  
flags:

../R24-branch/configure CC='gcc -arch x86_64' CXX='g++ -arch x86_64'  
F77='gfortran -arch x86_64' FC='gfortran -arch x86_64' --with-blas='- 
framework vecLib' --with-lapack --without-x CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/ 
include LDFLAGS='-L/usr/local/lib/x86_64 -L/usr/local/lib'  
r_arch=x86_64 --with-system-zlib --build=x86_64-apple-darwin8.8.1

If you don't have 64-bit readline, add --without-readline. If you  
install the above (make ; make install), it will add 64-bit support  
to your existing R framework (I didn't test the framework itself,  
though). Remove the r_arch flag if you want single-arch R.

Cheers,
Simon

Jeff,

Thank you for this information, unfortunately this made no difference:

INSTRUCTIONS:

    The "libz" library is required by the MySQL client library
    in order to compress/uncompress connections between clients
    and the MySQL engine.

    Make sure you have "libz" installed properly and/or included
    in your $LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  Perhaps it is not in any of the
    standard directories (e.g., /usr/lib/, /usr/local/lib)?

Aborting the installation of RMySQL.

Yes (see several posts on this list such as

Ooops, the CRAN build should have been ok, but the mysql on the build  
machine was broken - sorry about that, it's fixed now and the package  
is available from the r.research.att.com site (and soon on all mirrors).

Cheers,

Hi, Jeff, Paul, Simon, all,

It seems to me that I have gone into trouble waters without the required skills! Well, it is a way to gain knowledge. I do hope colleagues out there don't mind this kind of questions.

I think that I am doing things without a clear idea about what I do and/or what I must.

First of all, concerning MySQL, I have a MySQL running instance installed from an universal binary, mysql-max-5.0.27-osx10.4-i686.dmg. It installs/start/stop without a glitch. Here the content of its /mysql/lib folder...

ricardo-rodriguezs-computer:/usr/local/mysql/lib rrodriguez$ ls
libdbug.a               libmysqlclient_r.a      libndbclient.la
libmygcc.a              libmystrings.a          libz.a
libmysql.imp            libmysys.a
libmysqlclient.a        libndbclient.a

Whithin this directory I can found two libmysqlclient*.* files: libmysqlclient.a and libmysqlclient_r.a. 

I have also downloaded and exploded to Desktop a mysql-5.0.27.tar.gz file. I can find libmysqlclient.la in /Desktop/mysql-5.0.27/libmysql folder.

Whatever directory I point to by exporting PKG_CPPFLAGS and PKG_LIBS, I get different errors when I try to build RMySQL.

I can post here each output, but perhaps it could be useful to know what we are looking for and what must we try.

One preliminary question, please, what is the difference between a *.l, a *.la and a *r.a files with the same "name"? What file does content the libraries needed at building time?

As for the compression libraries, Paul is having problems with that, this issue has been solved here by installing the Xcode Tools included with the bundled installation DVD. Just insert the installation DVD, open the Xcode Tools and install then by double-clicking the XcodeTools.mpkg file.

As for last Simon's message in this sam thread, please, does it mean that the problem rely in the RMySQL available release at CRAN?

Sorry if I am messing things!

All the best,

Ricardo

I hope in the next month or two to start looking into using multiple
threads in R's vectorized arithmetic system on multiprocessor systems.
Preliminary experiments suggest that this might be useful for some of
the more intensive functions in the math library, but It's not yet
clear whether this will pay off enough to warrant reorganizations that
might be needed -- we should know more before too long.

Best,

Message-ID: <1300025681-1162568505-cardhu_blackberry.rim.net-1008236367-@bwe008-cell00.bisx.prod.on.blackberry>

Hello,

Sort of confused who I was talking to - plus I'm not registered on R-SIG-Mac so I don't think these replies are making it through.

One part (of many) to the RMySQL problems I was having was no zlib detected.  Looking through the Makefile inside the tar.gz RMySQL I noticed some comments relating to the error - they sort of dismissed them as not the package's problem, and said "oh well" if people couldn't figure it out.

Definetely check that the most recent XCode is installed, and your PATH variable is set to include all the related includes from the developer's tools.

Another thing you may try in uncompressing the RMySQL package like so:

$ tar -xvzf RMySQL....tar.gz (fill in your version)

And cd to the new directory. Read all the documentation there - e.g. README...

Try running the standard (unix not R standard) configure/make and look at the errors.  It may be a linker issue, or a permissions one, or something else.

You'll probably just have to discard the configure/build(make) process, but it may give you some hints as to what is causing the problems.

I haven't had a moment to try to rebuild my install, but as soon as I do I'll tell you how it went.

No, my message was saying two things:
1) you don't need to go through all this at all - just get the  
binary, i.e. run
install.packages("RMySQL")
if that doesn't work with your mirror (because it's not in sync yet),  
use
install.packages("RMySQL",,"http://r.research.att.com/")
Before my post the binary was not available due to a problem on my  
build machine, but the source was available and working.

2) if you insist on building RMySQL from sources, make sure the  
PKG_xx flags are set correctly (see the reference I gave), you have  
installed gcc 4.0.3 that comes with R and the latest Xcode tools.

Cheers,

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] R EPS graphics and PDFs from Word Documents
Message-ID: <86DCB6AC-B467-43F6-AAD3-02B8B86CAFC9@sauder.ubc.ca>

Hi All,

This is likely to be viewed as being at the margins of acceptable for  
this list, but I've run into an issue that I can't find a way around.  
Specifically, I'm working with a Windows based co-author, who is also  
MS Word based. So far I've found that we get the best graphic quality  
using EPS graphic files created by R. The problem is that when I just  
use the standard way of getting a PDF of the Word document by saving  
the file as a PDF in the main print dialog, the resulting PDF has the  
grayed warning box indicating that the graphic can't be seen on  
screen. If I instead use the option to convert the PDF to PostScript,  
and then convert the resulting PostScript file back to PDF using  
Preview, I get the graphics the way they should be. I can see them on  
screen, and so can anyone else. I can print them on one of my  
PostScript printers, but when folks on Windows go to print these PDFs  
to a PCL printer the output is a string of Ss. I then tried taking  
the PS files and converting them to PDFs using ghostscript (ESP's OS  
X port of gs 7.07 available from Gimp-Print). This causes all the  
graphics to come through properly, but the text is gibberish. I did  
get what appears to be a clean conversion via CERN's document service  
(but in A4, which is a problem in Canada and the US).

Has anyone run into this problem and discovered the work-around that  
seems to be eluding me?

Dan

I'm no MySQL person, but it would seem a likely error message
based on the above. The exported variables are to pathnames
that are nonexistent. Try these instead:

PKG_CPPFLAGS="-I/Users/rrodriguez/Desktop/mysql-5.0.27/include"
PKG_LIBS="-L/Users/rrodriguez/Desktop/mysql-5.0.27/lib -lmysqlclient"

Thanks. The case matters at Users and I've being passing along users to the variables. This way, it is hard to get a successful built!

But I am still getting error messages. In fact there is no /lib directory at ~/Desktop/mysql-5-0-27. This folder was created by exploding MySQL source downloaded from http://dev.mysql.com/get/Downloads/MySQL-5.0/mysql-5.0.27.tar.gz/from/ftp://ftp.rediris.es/mirror/mysql/ . I am afraid I do not know what I am trying to do, but trying to learn how to build MySQL from the scratch. Sorry if I am wasting your time.

As I have posted in a previous message, please, could you tell me what is the difference between this three files?

~/Desktop/mysql-5-0-27/libmysql/libmysqlclient.la

/usr/local/mysql/lib/libmysqlclient_r.a
/usr/local/mysql/lib/libmysqlclient.a

The headers seems to be in both directories even though I keep getting a NO at some checking for mysql.h during compilation. Far from understand why.

Following last Simon's message I have gotten RMySQL installed. I only keep trying to build it from sources to understand why/why not it works or it doesn't. This task will probably be out of the scope of this list. Please, accept my apologies if you consider this is an out of the list topic. Thanks.

Thanks for your help,

Ricardo

HFS+ is case insensitive by default so it shouldn't matter. However,  
you're passing the wrong directories anyway - mysql sources won't  
work for this.

I don't think you really want to do this, especially if you're not  
sure what you're doing. You can get mysql binary from the MySQL pages  
(and apparently you have it already). Compiling MySQL may be a nice  
exercise, but I would recommend you to get RMySQL compiled first as  
it is much easier.

Those are the static libraries that you can use if you compile RMySQL  
from sources - the -L flag tells the compile where to look for them  
(that's why it says PKG_LIBS='-L/usr/local/mysql/lib -l  
libmysqlclient').

A quick look at config.log would tell you - that is the first step  
you should take when something goes wrong. I don't remember if the  
first post was from you, but if it fails at -lz already, then the  
problem is more likely your tools and not the way you set the flags.  
Please use the PKG_xx settings I posted and send me your config.log  
if in doubt.

Cheers,
Simon

So, it is Bourne's shell what is making the HFS+ looks like case sensitive?

Agreed! Yes, I've already downloaded and installed MySQL binary. It runs without a glitch.

>from sources - the -L flag tells the compile where to look for them  
>(that's why it says PKG_LIBS='-L/usr/local/mysql/lib -l

This is now clearer for me. Thus, .la files must be source files binary libraries are compiled from. Am I right?

Another issue there: -lmysqlclient at PKS_LIBS works here. -libmysqlclient doesn't. Does it work for you? Why this -libmysqlclient doesn't work here then?

>From the whole log file there are a couple of things are calling my attention:

1. Why these two NO at checking for mysql_init in -lmysqlclient and checking for mysql.h?

* Installing *source* package 'RMySQL' ...
creating cache ./config.cache
checking how to run the C preprocessor... cc -E
checking for compress in -lz... yes
checking for getopt_long in -lc... yes
checking for mysql_init in -lmysqlclient... no
checking for mysql.h... no
updating cache ./config.cache
creating ./config.status
creating src/Makevars

2. There are a number of  warning multiple definitions of symbol _xxxxx. Do they matter?

In spite of these, at the end a clear * DONE (RMySQL) appears!

I've tried the same syntax before, but I'd not installed DBI before trying to build RMySQL. That was another error on my side.

Once more, thanks for your help,

Ricardo

I've been in a similar situation (not recently enough to remember  
every detail, unfortunately) and found that converting the PDF files  
to PNG files worked smoothly.

Microsoft Word does not handle EPS nor PDF graphics properly. If you
want to embed your graphic in a word document, the best option is to
save as jpeg from R. The quality of the figure is good enough.

However, if you are working for a publication, then most probably they
will be asking for a EPS. In that case, wrote your paper in Word and
do not try to insert the figures in the document. Send them as both
EPS and PDF individual files instead.

I do think that the best option for a paper is to use LaTeX. The best
figures in R are generated using postscript (EPS) which can be
inserted very well on LaTeX documents.

I have had the best results saving the R graphic as pdf (default), then
using Apple's Preview program to convert it to png.  When pasted into
Word or PowerPoint, the png graphic can be resized, opened in Windows,
etc. and still looks good.

This is the same strategy as Adobe Illustrator's "Save for Office", 
that is, convert to png. Which I have had good experience with.

For that matter, I have recently been using R's png() device for 
graphics inserted into PowerPoint, with good results. I don't know 
about *printing* from a Windows box, but they display well via 
projector.

hi,

i've problem to install RGTK2,

when i try to install it, i've this error:

sorry for the O.T. question
but i need to update gtk to 2.8.0 ....

i've installed GTK from darwinports,
i've tryed to update " GTK2 "  using darvinports but i've this error:

Alternatively you may set the BASE_DEPENDENCIES_CFLAGS and

to avoid the need to call pkg-config.  See the pkg-config man page for

I dont know why it is failing the macports install as I have gtk2  
(gtk2.10) installed without problems. You may want to try in the  
macports mailing list (at http://www.macports.org).

Anyway, even if you install it this way it is not going to work for  
you because R and macports use different compilers and the installed  
RGtk2 package behaves incorrectly (different structure sizes). You  
have to manually install the gtk package and its dependencies -that  
happens to be the ones in the error message of the macports log- with  
the same compiler used to compile R (found in /usr/local/gcc4.0). If  
you have a macports installation it is better to move the directory  
while you install the new gtk and RGtk2 packages as if not you are  
going to enter into problems (as I did) with the different versions.  
It is a little bit tedious but it works.

I was told by Michael Lawrence, the maintainer and co-author of the  
package that an easy to install solution is on the way, but no idea  
when it will come into life.

If anyone has a better way to deal with this please let me know.

HTH,

Diego.


P.D.
i think i have sent the reply to you two times, sorry.

The R itself is pretty much the same - the major differences are in  
the OS (better support for virtual memory, 64-bit support, it's a  
unix etc.) but not R (basically because we develop R primarily on  
unix and use unix-based tools to create the Windows version). The GUI  
for R is different on a Mac - it strives to be more intuitive to Mac  
users, but I don't think there are many features you would miss (you  
may rather find a couple of new ones). I suspect that R will be your  
least problem when switching to Mac OS X ;).

And BTW if you really crave for Windows version of R you can actually  
run it on a MacBook Pro in OS X even without installing Windows and  
it works :)

Simon,

Is that R Windows GUI being run using CrossOver 
(http://www.codeweavers.com/products/cxmac/)? I don't see any sign of 
Parallels in that screenshot.

I'm getting a new MacBook Pro in a week or so, and while it never 
occurred to me to run the Windows version of R on it, I think it's a 
fun demo of the capability of the new Intel-based Macs.

Well, you couldn't run it without Windows if it
used Parallels, so it must be CrossOver.

I know that, but there might be something out there that I haven't heard of.
For all I know, maybe Simon is smart enough to install Wine without CrossOver.

(and apologies to everyone; I actually didn't think the question was 
worthy of r-sig-mac and meant to send it only to Simon)

	Not results from a MacBook Pro (Intel)

	and very limited testing results

	but a PowerMac Quad G5 (2.5 GHz)

	took about twice as long to run one program

	as a Dell WS 670 Quad Xeon (2.8 GHz)

	Your Mileage May/Will Vary

Indeed, it's just the current version of Wine without any add ons (it  
is reasonably easy to compile and I could put up a binary for those  
interested). Originally I was installing it only to be able to run  
HHC when cross-compiling R for Windows and I was surprised that the  
resulting R worked including graphics and all. The Wine page is  
warning that the support is very shaky, but apparently it is  
sufficient to run R (the R installer works as well). You can, of  
course, get even better Windows support if you have a Windows license  
and use native DLLs instead of Wine's implementations, but that's  
another story and we may be getting off-topic here I suppose ;)

Cheers,
Simon

As others have said, R is pretty similar.  I'm mainly a Windows user, 
but I have an Intel MacBook, and I like R on it better than Windows in 
the following ways:

  - The editor in R is nicer, with syntax highlighting, syntax hints, etc.

  - If you can figure out how to get it going, the XCode debugger is a 
nicer source-level debugger for C code in R or R packages than what's 
available for gcc code in Windows.  (It feels like a professional 
debugger, such as you'd get with Microsoft or Borland software, but 
those don't support gcc.  Insight in Windows feels like a kludge.)

  - The console is smarter about offering you previously entered 
commands rather than previously entered lines, when you scroll up.

Things I don't like:

  - It's a major PITA to figure out how to get XCode working when you're 
not doing all your development within it.  I think there's a bigger GNU 
community in Windows development than in Mac development, so it's easier 
to get help.

  - The console scroll-back sometimes turns into cursor movement instead.

  - There are two incompatible graphics systems available, so packages 
like rgl only work half the time:  either as X11 packages, or as 
(Aqua/Carbon/whatever they call the nice looking graphics).  I'd love to 
know how to compile it so that it used whichever graphics was present at 
run-time, but so far that looks quite hard.

  - Subversion has better integration (TortoiseSVN) in Windows than on 
the Mac.  In fact, there isn't even a binary of version 1.4.x of 
Subversion available for download yet, two months after release.  But if 
you're set up for compiling R, compiling svn isn't a big deal, and if 
you're not set up for compiling R, you may have no need for Subversion, 
so this isn't much of a problem.

And some irritants that may or may not be relevant:

  - The Macbook case has a very sharp edge, which makes my hands quite 
sore if I rest them on it as I'm typing.  Old Macbook Pros don't have 
this problem; hopefully new ones won't either.

  - I know Windows tools better so I'm still more comfortable there.  I 
think there is no Mac equivalent of TortoiseSVN or Beyond Compare (a 
graphical diff utility, quite a bit better than what I've found for the 
Mac so far).

Can you be more specific, please? The results vary a lot depending on  
the vecLib you use, which version of the OS etc. because Apple was  
improving vecLib support substantially. The same is true of Windows -  
depending on your BLAS the results will vary a lot. Comparing G5 vs  
MacBook is quite irrelevant because they are entire different  
architectures and Windows doesn't run on G5. If you have some  
specific examples, please let me know so we can test it. Note that R  
2.4.0 on Mac OS X allows you to switch between various BLAS back-ends  
very easily, so you can choose the back-end that suits your  
application most.

Dear Carlos,

I am currently using R on two Macs at home (MacBook Pro and G5 iMac)  
and on Window (at work). In the past I used it also on LINUX. My  
thoughts and impressions:

1. R works very well on all platforms, I never observed compatibility  
issues between the platforms. New versions get released for all  
platforms in parallel.

2. The default user-interface is best on MacOS X (e. g. has syntax  
highlighting). A major advantage of the Mac is the Quartz graphics  
device. Graphics quality on screen is much better and it is possible  
to copy and paste graphics without quality loss to other applications.

3. Developing and building own packages is easier on UNIX based  
system (Mac OS or LINUX) then on Windows. You can also build binary  
packages for Windows on LINUX or Mac OS.

4. The MacBook Pro (I have a CoreDuo 1 15' 1.86 MHz) is a very nice  
machine including the software it comes with (from PhotoBooth to  
XCode). For R there is definitely no need in running Windows on the  
Mac; if you need to exchange a lot of MS office documents you can  
consider buying MS Office for Mac, but free NeoOffice is sufficient  
if you get e. g. data in EXCEL format.

Best regards,
Klaus

That is because Martin Ott of Coding Monkeys maintains a very nice
binary package for Subversion. Just updated today to 1.4.2 in fact.
Xcode IIRC now supports Subversion (as does TextMate, my favorite Mac
editor).

TextMate's graphical diff is quite good. I can't speak to a
TortoiseSVN-esque tool since I prefer to use it through my editor, but
I would be unsurprised to learn that such a Finder extension existed
(I don't really use the Finder much). There is an SVN plugin for
Quicksilver if you use that.

maybe you should use

Sys.putenv() to install shell variables before using the usual R.app  
installer.

As a general rule, Sys.getenv("PATH") tells you what it's currently  
set for PATH.

or you can set PATH to what you like system-wide in /etc/profile

Never seen Beyond Compare, but what's wrong with the
Apple-supplied File Merge? Well, outside the fact that
the Mighty Mouse scroll wheel doesn't work using it [bug
filed with ADC]. Does about the same as 'mgdiff' used to
do on Un*x.

I agree with most of what he said here. I would note however
that we routinely have to use the X11() device instead of
quartz() device in R due to speed issues. I have code that
would take several minutes drawing a heatmap using quartz
device. One day I accidentally started X11 device instead
and found the same code executed in about fifteen seconds.

Once (in the original implementation of the device) it was possible  
to set "antialias=FALSE" when opening quartz() to get reasonable  
speed in drawing, but of course you loose the nice quartz antialias  
effect, and get  results similar to X11 or windows device.

it seems that this option has no longer effect

Here's what I prefer about BC:

- It allows simple in-place edits, e.g. to fix up a single line, to copy
one line from one side to the other, etc.
- It allows me to configure an external editor for more extensive edits,
putting the cursor at the currently viewed location.
- It has a nicer display of the files.  FileMerge leaves the spacing of 
each file in its original form, and changes the alignment of lines 
depending on where the cursor is; BC inserts specially marked 
place-holder lines on the side that's missing an addition, so lines that 
compare equal are always lined up.  This facilitates copying a block of 
changes to one side or the other.
- BC is integrated with Explorer, so you can select a file/directory for 
comparison in one folder, move to another folder, and say "compare to 
this".
- I was going to say FileMerge can't compare directories because I 
didn't realize until now that FileMerge can do that:  this is because it 
hides this capability so well!
- BC can be set as the diff utility for Subversion, so when I compare a 
file to the repository copy and do any of the edits above, they affect 
the real file on disk, rather than a copy of it as the svndiffshim.py 
script does. I spend a lot of time comparing files, because I routinely 
review any modifications I make before committing them, so as not to 
commit debug lines, unintentional changes, etc.  This is absolutely easy 
in BC, but quite painful in FileMerge due to the poor integration with 
Subversion.
- BC can take hints from the user to re-synchronize when it makes a 
mistake on automatic syncing.
- BC is configurable for what are "unimportant differences", so you can
ignore reformatting of code if you want.  I don't use this much, but 
it's very nice when I need it.

BC isn't perfect: the menu is too crowded, with obscure options that I 
never use, etc., but it's a very nice graphical diff utility.  Following 
Byron's recommendation, I'm going to take a look at TextMate's diff. 
Presumably it would have better editor integration, at least.

In my experience, it gets better with each iteration and there is a

I am not quite sure what that would mean.  Both are always present in  
the current default installs of MacOS, but yes it is an issue because  
of conflicts such as that the Aqua Tcl/Tk GUI and stuff that uses it  
cannot be started from the Aqua Mac GUI (all buried in stuff about  
menu bars and event loops).  X11 Tcl/Tk will work within the Aqua  
GUI.  Either GUI can be started from a shell.

As others have observed Xcode, and Textmate both integrate nicely  
with SVN.  I would add that my own favourite BBEdit also has CVS and  
SVN integration and my favourite GUI for diff.
Also SvnX is a magic GUI for creating, browsing and managing code  
repositories.

I think that is important too.  One is often most productive with the  
platform one knows best.

An even more marked effect of x11() can be seen with scatter plots with
large numbers of points (eg MvA microarray plots).   I guess this is really
taxing the antialiasing.

On my 667/G4 TiBook:

> quartz()
> system.time(plot(rnorm(10000), pch="."))
[1] 2.774 0.120 3.549 0.000 0.000
> x11()
> system.time(plot(rnorm(10000), pch="."))
[1] 0.082 0.009 0.174 0.000 0.000

That's over a 30-fold speed hike with x11.

David

make

I use R as command line interface in the OS X terminal. Now when I  
copy some R-code into the terminal, i only can paste some 38 rows of  
the code
. Then R hangs, which mean that i can not paste more than 38 rows of  
R code into the R application running in the terminal.


Does someone have the same problem or has a solution?

You could use the source function.  For instance if your code is in  
the file someCode.q then you can have R execute it by running

 > source("someCode.q")

For this to work someCode.q must be in R's current working directory  
which you can check with the getwd() function.  Otherwise you have to  
use the full path to someCode.q which you can find by dropping  
someCode.q onto your terminal window.  Good luck.

Thanks for the answer Kjell. But i am wonder why i can only paste  
certain number of R code rows
to the r application in the terminal and how i can fix this strange  
behavior.

I generally use R in the terminal and build it with '--enable-R-shlib  
--disable-R-framework --without-aqua' and I am able to paste even  
thousands of lines into the terminal.  The only problem is that,  
since I do enable readline, R prints out a listing of the working  
directory every time it encounters a tab.

I have encountered a similar problem at times - the number of lines  
is not fixed, it depends on the text and it doesn't always happen.  
The problem is in the Terminal application, not R (i.e. you get the  
same problem with other applications run in the Terminal). You may  
want to use the R GUI instead which doesn't have such limitation.

Cheers,
Simon

Dear Simon

I think the problem is in R (or how I configured it). If  i open an  
Terminal
i can paste so many lines i want. But when i start R the the number of
the lines is limited.

Best Regards

Christoph

I've experienced this in the past as well.
What I've noticed (although not able to reproduce anything now) is  
that this problem occurs in the definition of a function or when  
there is a for-loop. I mean in between { } in such two cases.
It is like some escape char is passed to (or by) the Terminal.app and  
the R parser raise an error.

I think Simon is right. Could you try to copy and paste to R from  
xterm shell ? (X11.app, new terminal and then paste)

Another test: try to copy and paste from a different editor to see if  
it always happens at the same line.

The X11 application shows the same behavior as the Terminal  
application does, which means i can only paste a limited number os rows.
I also tried to copy the code in different editors with the same  
results. I only can paste a certain number of rows of the R code.

Regards

Christoph

Ok, then it's a different issue from what I was observing.

Do you have a reproducible example? (i.e. can you send us the code  
you run or some code that triggers the problem?).

Also can you try the CRAN binary version of R? If it is a problem  
with your compilation, then the CRAN binary may show a different  
behavior.

Thanks,
Simon

Dear Simon

I installed the binary version of R. And now i can paste as many
rows of R code as i want. I used a wrong Fortran Complier.
I downloaded the Fortran Complier from here:  http://gcc.gnu.org/ 
fortran/

But know i have the right compiler from here:

and every thing works find.

Thank you very much for your help.

yes, that's was what I get, and that's why it always happen to me in  
the definition of long functions or loop, because I was using tabs :)

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] estrange characters
Message-ID: <20061114T175313Z_C5AC00020000@xen.net>

Hi all,

Running R in MacBook: R Cocoa GUI 1.16 (3198) on R 2.3.1 Framework.

I do need to create some hard copies of a number of graphics. These graphics include symbols like ? (euro currency symbol), or ?, ?, ?, and so on, so forth.

Quartz correctly shows this characters. If I copy the graphics from their Quartz window let's say to a new NeoOffice document, all works fine. But if I use the postscript device or the Save as... Quartz's option, the resulting eps or pdf file shows incorrectly the same characters.

Please, what point am I missing? How could I set up my installation to produce correct graphics?

Thanks for your help,

Ricardo

Hi,
i'm tryng to write a script to use
  R - Grass.


i've found this tutorial :

if i execute the line directly in a bash shell it give me not problem,
but if i try to use the same code in a bash script, i've an error  
message.

"with this code there aren't problem":

The code :

======================================================
#

x$morph_class <- morph.clara$clustering
rast.put6(x,"morph", zcol="morph_class")

after this,...
  i quit R and see the result in Grass

it's all OK !


but if itry to have the same result with a "bash script"
like this :

This question is not really about R. Please consider reading some  
documentation about shell programming - you have a few problems in  
the script.

When you intend to use double quotes (e.g. as parameter to echo), you  
have to escape them inside the string. You also have to escape `$' in  
cases where you mean it literally and don't want variable expansion.  
Use single quotes in shell scripts if you don't want to use shell  
expansion. Another alternative is to use heredoc notation. Also  
creating a temporary file via echo is superfluous since you can pipe  
it right into R. In addition, I can't find any shell variables at a  
first glance to be expanded, so you could as well put the script in a  
file saving you all the quoting trouble.
I have no idea about GRASS, so I can't really comment on the other  
part of the script file, but remove the echo command with the script  
and create a single text - that could be a beginning.

Cheers,
Simon

PS: this is entirely independent of Mac OS - you can safely ask unix  
users about this.

i've resolved my problem.

i've changed the line so:

from:

echo"

some_line_with_the_"quotes"

"

to:

echo '

some_line_with_the_"quotes"

'

i use   '   single quote, instead the double quote "

sorry for the newbie question!

I'm trying to build R-2.4.0 on a rather old mac powerbook, using Simon's
gcc403.dmg.  Things go smoothly until:

rudjer: sudo make install
Password:
make[1]: Nothing to be done for `install'.

installing doc ...
help2man: can't get `--version' info from ../bin/R
make[1]: *** [R.1] Error 22
make: *** [install] Error 1

I know that there was some earlier discussion of this, but my reading
of the tea leaves from that discussion suggested that the problem should have
been resolved in the 2.4.0  release.  The suggestion of Kieran Healy

 	https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-mac/2006-May/002925.html

still works, but somehow I assume that there is something wrong with my
configuration.

Message-ID: <667A029A-591A-4E3D-8221-5735DD223E87@magpienest.org>

I've been trying to get RSQLite working and have run into a  
difficulty. This is on a iBook G3 running Mac OS 10.4.8, using the  
CRAN binary of R 2.4.0, and with the binary of RSQLite 0.4-13. I get  
the same problem with both the RSQLite binary from CRAN and the one  
from the http://R.research.att.com/ repository. I have no problems  
installing the binary but when I try to load it I get the following  
error:

.....

 > library(RSQLite)

Can anyone offer a fix for this? Searching through the R-SIG-Mac

(e.g. the thread here https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-mac/2006-

I can confirm the error on ppc OS X 10.4.8 using the CRAN binary.  I'm
not sure what the solution is.  I'm helping to maintain RSQLite, so
please let me know if code changes to the package are required.

Message-ID: <989CC4E5-1E2E-4E09-872E-342944482740@leeds.ac.uk>

Hi,

I have a problem which is replicable, but I can only repeat it on an  
Intel mac. I'm also uncertain if it is an R bug, or a bug in the  
nl2sol routine that (I believe) is packaged within R.

Basically, on certain (large) datasets, and under certain specific  
starting parameters, the nls routine hangs indefinitely when using  
the "port" algorithm. The hanging R process then has to be killed  
from the outside. Using "trace=TRUE" shows that it completes a single  
iteration, then stops. This doesn't happen on PPC macs, or on the AMD  
linux box that I have tried.

Since it is such a specific problem, I guess it is easiest if I try  
to debug this myself, but I'm not sure how to do it. Could someone  
possibly tell me what I need to do work out exactly what the problem is?

I've tried to narrow it down using "debug". It seems to hang after  
the R_port_nlsb call, as follows:

Browse[1]>
debug: .Call(R_port_nlsb, m, d = rep(as.double(scale), length = length 
(par)),
     df = m$gradient(), iv, v, low, upp)
Browse[1]>
   0      35.9307: -365.347  449.622 -1.57080  3.58496 0.0100000  
0.500100
***hangs after outputting this first nls "trace" line***

I've then run

/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/R -d gdb

and interrupted + traced where it is hanging. I get the output pasted  
below:

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] R hangs in nls "port" routine

You should also report R.Version() and sessionInfo() and also if you  
are using CRAn version of R or your own build. Sometimes is it of help.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] system() from R.app
Message-ID: <99F44D6A-8EFD-45A6-869B-439AC34DAC37@unive.it>

Dear all,

I have a question on the use of system(command) from R.app:
if I try, for instance, to do:

system("latex foo.tex")

I get the following output in the console:

/bin/sh: line 1: latex: command not found

While if I do the same thing running R from the terminal (or xterm  
under X11) it works just fine.
I guess the reason is that, when in the terminal, the path is set by  
my shell init file (which, incidentally, is bash) while this doesn't  
happen when in R.app.
By the way, running latex is not a big issue: I can get the right  
path from options(), but for other commands the problem will still be  
there

Is there a workaround for this?

Thanks in advance for any help.

Best,
Nicola

Nicola,
yes, R.app does not have the same env vars sets of the shell. This,  
indeed, applies to all GUI app under OS X. It is possible to set env  
vars at OS X level. There is a plist file somewhere. I don't remember  
the details because I never use it.

In your case latex is not the the current path used by R.app

You can check it using
path <- Sys.getenv("PATH")
path

in my case latex is under /usr/local/teTeX/bin/powerpc-apple-darwin- 
current (a "which latex" or env in the shell will tell) so

new.path <- paste(path,":/usr/local/teTeX/bin/powerpc-apple-darwin- 
current", sep="")

and add latex path using

Sys.putenv("PATH"= new.path)
now latex should work.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Minor bug
Message-ID: <D63CEC16-5FEF-4A00-9B4A-5E9AD6306BC5@mac.com>

Hi,

I just encountered a minor bug. If you set the working directory to a  
folder, and then delete that folder, R starts throwing an error to  
the console repeatedly:

2006-11-30 11:50:49.520 R[1430] *** Assertion failure in - 
[NSTextFieldCell _objectValue:forString:errorDescription:],  
AppKit.subproj/NSCell.m:1298
2006-11-30 11:50:49.520 R[1430] *** NSTimer discarding exception  
'Invalid parameter not satisfying: aString != nil' that raised during  
firing of timer with target 5dfe10 and selector 'showWorkingDir:'

Clearly it's just not finding the directory (since it no longer  
exists). Perhaps in this event it can note that the folder is no  
longer there and reset the working directory to home and just list a  
single error (note) in the console?

I am using R v.2.4.0 GUI 1.7 (3868).

Thanks to all for all the hard work on this app!

Cheers,

Demitri

Michael,

you seem to have a wild mix of packages (old R version and wrong  
architecture). I would strongly recommend you to delete ~/Library/R/ 
library, e.g. type

rm -rf ~/Library/R/library

in Terminal and re-install packages that you use. Your custom library  
path shadows system packages, so even if you re-install them system- 
wide, you will still pick up your old packages that break. When using  
custom library path be aware that you don't have the versioning  
safety you have with system libraries (see Mac FAQ). You can change  
this in the Preferences, too.

Cheers,
Simon

If that is the case, try to delete the workspace (or move it aside,  
e.g. run
mv ~/.RData ~/espace.RData
in Terminal)
I cannot reproduce it (with R 2.4.0), though. If the error still  
persists, please send me the details about your R version. The error  
below indicates that your R.app and R framework are incompatible.  
Make sure you use the correct R.app version and framework.  
(getDllInfo was used in R.app for R 2.3.0  but it's no longer present  
in R 2.4.0).

Simon

Ken,

I don't know really what it is, but your example works fine in both  
current R 2.4.0 patched and in R-devel even on my Intel iMac. Please  
test it as well and let me know if that solves your problem.

Cheers,
Simon

Simon,

Thank you for trying this out.  I just updated to today's
patched (thank for making that into such an easy thing to
do), though I get "page not found" for the nightly build
of the Rgui.app (that will certainly be accessible later).
So, I've retried and I get the same error.  So, it must
be something on my system and not a an Intel vs powerpc
problem, since it works for you.  That hypothesis is out
the window.

I"m running Mac OS X 10.4.8, 2.165 Ghz Intel Core Duo,
2 GB 667 MHz DDR2 SDRAM, in case that matters.

Since I can solve the problem on the Intel by adding
derivative information to the model (and also by running
it on my powerpc), I'm not suffering from not having a
solution.  As you demonstrate, however, it should work.
Can you suggest where I might look?  Thanks.

best,

ken
