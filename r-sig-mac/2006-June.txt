Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] R.app always loads home workspace
Message-ID: <C0A4CC10.1D0A%jahumada@ci.conservation.org>

Since upgrading to R 2.3  and R.app 1.16 the workspace in my home directory
is always loaded independently of whether I start R.app in the home
directory or not. For example if I type in the terminal:

open -a R.app /someOtherDIrectory/

The ~/.RData file is uploaded when R starts. In the system preferences I do
not have checked the 'always apply' in the startup options, but my home
directory is the startup directory..This was not the usual behavior before..
I am  using the latest build  (3186) of R.app

Thanks,

the problem is that tcltk loads tkrplot as a tcl
module -- and if you use the aqua version of tcl/tk then
this can only load modules if they are dylibs, not
bundles. this is not a problem with the x11 version of
tcltk, but for the aqua version you need to build tkrplot
as tkrplot.dylib instead of tkrplot.so (and change
.first.lib accordingly).

so my guess is you probably have a version of aqua tcl/tk
on your system

I'm pretty sure this indicates a permission issue, but that it is not

you'll need to follow the instructions in the block of text above and give 
the build process appropriate paths for your pgsql libraries.

after that, it should just work.

This means that the HTML index of packages (which is generated for  
each help session) cannot be updated - in most cases you get this  
error when the help system was not started yet and thus the index  
doesn't even exist. However, I can only speculate, because you didn't  
tell us which version of R you are using, whether this is the GUI or  
the console, how you installed the packages etc...

You may want to install R 2.3.1 instead, there were a couple of quite  
important bugfixes (especially in the GUI).

Not recently, but there were no problems except for one bug in Rpy -  
I don't know if that was fixed yet, but you may want to read

https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-mac/2005-September/002275.html

If that doesn't help, please be more specific as of how your lack of

Dear list,

I am using the R GUI on a powermac G5 running Tiger, and despite having
selected English as a language in the systems preferences, the GUI tries
to speak to me in Japanese. It is a very aware GUI, for it may have
smelled the flagrance of green tea on my desk, as I am indeed
geographically localised in Japan. However, I am not expert enough in
japanese to read error messages...

More seriously, I figured out that it uses the "Region" information in the
"Format" tab of the "International" section of the preferences, which I
set to japanese to have the dates and currencies japanese-style. I would
be inclined to call this a bug, but maybe it is an intentionnal
behaviour?

Have a nice day,

Yes. By default the region setting defines the language used by R.  
This behavior is rooted in the fact that it is the only valid locale  
information that can be reliably obtained from the OS. There is,  
however, a work-around for such specific cases where the region  
information contradicts the language setting, namely the locale can  
be set regardless of the system setting. For example if you wish to  
use US-english locale, you can force the GUI to do so by writing in  
the Terminal:

defaults write org.R-project.R force.LANG en_US.UTF-8

The only requirement is that the locale must use UTF-8, otherwise  
many things will break. In addition to that, it is always possible to  
use the corresponding LC_xx environment variables if finely-grained  
control over the locale is desired.

Cheers,
Simon

Thank you very much for your detailed answer. May I suggest to integrate
it in the FAQ (I googled hard before asking for help on this list...).

I can propose a patch if I am given the source file of the FAQ...

export LDFLAGS="-L/sw/lib"
R CMD INSTALL rgdal_0.4-4.tar.gz

Apparently it still cannot find the proj_api.h, although the checks were 
ok. Any hints what I do wrong?

Thanks and regards

PS: Is there a possibility or function to search the mail archive?

Is it possible that such a generically named header file
actually is completely unrelated to the API in question?

You put FINK on your OS X system and expected it to use
it for development with non-FINK software. Ditch FINK and
compile what you need yourself.

No, proj_api.h:

Well, this would be an idea, but it worked quite well for me until now. 
I compiled things myself before on my Linux box and it took me a great 
deal of time to figure out all the dependencies, correct versions of 
dependencies and even sometimes the package/program the requested file 
resided in. And finally it also ends up in a non standard location 
(compared to a Linux machine). Perhaps I have a wrong understanding of 
this, but what Fink basically does, is figuring out and automatically 
installing the dependencies (of course into a non standard location). So 
the question is rather, why the configure script resp. the compiler does 
not find the file any more after the successful checks. Anyhow, I'll 
give it a try and compile it by hand.

Thanks and regards
Simon

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] rpy on macbook
Message-ID: <448440AB.5050804@tierzucht.tum.de>

Simon,

I tried the 2.3.1 binary. It doesn't make a difference.

There are actually two problems:

[macbook:/rpy-0.99.2] fries% python setup.py build
RHOMES= []
Setting RHOMES to  ['/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources']
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "setup.py", line 80, in ?
    RVERSION = rpy_tools.get_R_VERSION(RHOME, force_exec=True)
  File "/rpy-0.99.2/rpy_tools.py", line 102, in get_R_VERSION
    raise RuntimeError("Couldn't obtain version number from output\n"
RuntimeError: Couldn't obtain version number from output
of `R --version'.

I changed lines 80 and 81 of setup.py  to

RVERSION = '2.3.1'
RVER     = '2031'

Then I get the following:

[macbook:/rpy-0.99.2] fries% python setup.py build

This is not really Mac specific - the version string changed in R  
2.3.0 so rpy_tools needs to be adjusted:

^^ - although irrelevant (gcc ignores it) Rpy includes Windows linker  
paths here - a bad idea :)

For some reason you (or Rpy or python) is using the MacOSX10.4u SDK.  
If you want to do so, you have to make sure that R is included in the  
SDK. Probably the easiest solution is something like

sudo ln -s /Library /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk/Library

Another problem - you must use the gcc 4.0.3 compiler to compile Rpy,  
otherwise wrong libraries will be pulled. Make sure it's first on the  
PATH, like

export PATH=/usr/local/gcc4.0/bin:$PATH

before compiling Rpy. To make things even more complicated, Rpy/ 
python uses flags that are Apple-only and thus incompatible with that  
compiler (at least on my PPC Mac). If that is the case for you,  
you'll need a filter that strips those parameters. You can install it  
as follows:

curl -O http://www.rosuda.org/gccf.c
gcc -s -o gcc gccf.c
sudo rm -f /usr/local/gcc4.0/bin/gcc
sudo cp gcc /usr/local/gcc4.0/bin/gcc

I'm currently on the road without access to an Intel Mac so I can do  
the forensics on my PowerMac only - let me know if you encounter  
other problems (and the above works for me).

Cheers,
Simon

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] update packages
Message-ID: <4488DF58.7000700@ucdavis.edu>

Hello,

R 2.3.1
OSX 10.4.6 (G5 PPC)
GUI Version 1.16 (3217)

Two minor problems updating packages in 2.3.1

1) clicking on the magnifying glass in the package installer give the option to show 2.1.1 packages, not 2.2.1 (see old post below).  Seems like it should point to the most recently installed version.

2) selecting the "upgrade all" button results in the following error:

Error in update.packages(lib = ""/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/library/"",  :
    object "Library" not found

Of course typing the update.packages command while leaving out the double works fine.  Don't know where the double quotes are coming from; has anyone else seen this?

(The "install selected" button works normally.)  

Cheers,

Julin

Message-ID: <5E2E1D82-1A38-4767-9389-AC9E4D85565E@att.net>

Dear list,

I have the following system:
PowerMac G5, DP 1.8 GHz, 1.5GB Memory
Mac OS 10.4.6, R for Mac 2.3.1

When I use the Packages Installer from the R-Console, the installer  
goes thru the downloading correctly.  Then, when it is time to do the  
extraction and installation I get the following message:.

************ Error message starts here **********
Error in sprintf(gettext(fmt, domain = domain), ...) :
          argument is missing, with no default
tar: ~/Library/R/library/file4431b782: Cannot chdir: No such file or  
directory
tar: Error is not recoverable: exiting now

gzip: stdout: Broken pipe
************ Error message ends here ***********

I was using 2.2.1 before jumping to 2.3.1.  I searched the archives  
for references to no avail. Can anyone provide guidance on how to  
solve this problem?

TIA

Oscar

Are you installing packages at the System Level, At User Level, or in
another location?
I was running into similar problems. At first I thought it was because I
prefer to work in a standard User account for my day to day work and I use
an Administrator account for installing applications and system maintenance.
What I finally found to work was running the R Gui in an Administrator
account, using the R-Gui toolbar item that looks like a lock to "Authorize R
to run system commands as root", and installing the packages At System
Level. When doing this I run into many fewer errors when installing packages
via the GUI. And I can then go back to running R Gui in my User account.
I don't remember encountering the same difficulties prior to 2.3. My
instinctive guess is that either I have some permissions set up improperly
or that the package installers can no longer escalate the necessary
privileges to properly install. My second guess would be that perhaps the
package installers do not have access to some of the environment variables
that one would have set when working with R from the terminal.
Anyway, try the above, it should work.
Cheers

P.S. R is excellent and despite occasional glitches I believe it to be one
of the best tools for academics and researchers utilizing statistical
analyses and for visualizing their data.

I compiled and installed PROJ.4 under /usr/local. After this, the 
installation with R CMD worked smoothly. Surprisingly, there was no need 
to reinstall GDAL (installed with Fink). Apparently there is somewhere a 
hardcoded path (this is my interpretation), ignoring the flags.

Thanks for your help.

You know, the list that understands some folks are near idiot savants

but can not get the twingles and trepidations of the big R on old or  
new Macs.  Big R seems the ideal commercial for "this is what your

So, with that, I end with a simple plea,

Show me some simple, preferably linear, documentation.

D,

in Florida, where all our government data bases have pure, no-noise,  
data and all our public records requests are met promptly and

City, who are now identified as FLABBY.   Although it is fair to note  
that our fire departments are blocked by HIPPA.   Hmmm, maybe, just  
maybe, they think I'm cheering: hip, hip, hippa, hippa, hooray --  
Hippa, hippa.

I'm not cheering.  Show me the docs for R on Mac.  The ones you've  
been hiding.

D,
	For what it's worth, I, too, feel like I'm missing out on possibly  
useful Mac-specific functionality due to simply not knowing what  
features are available, what their benefits are, etc.  I also don't  
even try to follow detailed discussion of compiler options, tcl/tk  
library mismatches, and so on.  I have never built R from source.  In  
fact, I'm not even sure what you mean by "Big R", so forgive me if  
this response is completely irrelevant.

	That said, I have had no problem installing and running R --- I  
don't know if it's "Big R," but it's R --- by following the  
directions in the Mac OS X FAQ (go to http://www.r-project.org, click  
on FAQs in the menu at the left side of the page, and then choose  
"The R MacOS X FAQ").   The main section headings are:

Introduction

Command line version of R
R.app
How to install packages

Quartz device

Perhaps you could help improve the R for Mac OS X documentation by  
letting us know which of the following are true:

(1) You didn't know about this FAQ. (If this is the case, please tell

For all the rest, R-help list and lots of introductory documentation  
on R is available on the Internet and particularily under the  
Documentation/Contributed section on http://CRAN.R-project.org

But let me further add the following: to maximize the benefit (your  
benefit) of an answer to one of your questions, please try to be  
specific on the topic.

I still did not get right if you use a OS X Mac or a OS 9 Mac. This  
makes a huge difference, as the old one is currently not supported  
any more. The last version of R for Mac OS 8.6 -> 9.2.2 is R 1.7.1  
(http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macos) which we discourage to use for  
several reasons.
Otherwise, R for OS X (http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx) is just  
a standard Cocoa app with its own standard Apple installer package. R  
on OS X comes with a minimal GUI, but anyway everything in R should  
be typed on the Console like on other systems/platforms. Any book (or  
online reference) on R will help you to go on.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Reading in a table originally with ISO-latin1 encoding
	(Linux)
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.62.0606092101010.9783@venus.ling.helsinki.fi>

Dear developers

I asked this first on the general R-help list, and in the responses I 
received I was suggested to consult this list, as my problem appears 
to be specific to Macintosh.

I have earlier been working (and continue to work) with R in Linux, 
where reading in a table containing Scandinavian letters ("?", "?", 
and "?") in the header as part of variable names has not caused any 
problem whatsoever.

However, when trying to do the same in R running on a new MacOS-X 
(with an Intel processor) with the same original text table does not 
seem to work whichever way I try. Following the recommendations on the 
R site and using the 'file' function to set the encoding (which as far 
as I have been able to understand in ISO-latin1) breaks down at the 
first encounter with a Scandinavian character:

THINK <- read.table(file("R_data/hs+sfnet.T.060505.tbl4", 
encoding="latin1"),header=TRUE)
Warning messages:
1: invalid input found on input connection 'R_data/hs+sfnet.T.060505.tbl4'
2: incomplete final line found by readTableHeader on 
'R_data/hs+sfnet.T.060505.tbl4'

A sample source table exemplifying such characters as variable labels 
is below (for which the behavior of R in Mac is the same as for the 
larger file referred to above):.

    ajatella mietti? pohtia
1     FALSE   FALSE   TRUE
2     FALSE   FALSE  FALSE
3     FALSE    TRUE  FALSE
4     FALSE    TRUE  FALSE
5      TRUE   FALSE  FALSE
6      TRUE   FALSE  FALSE
7     FALSE   FALSE  FALSE
8     FALSE    TRUE  FALSE
9     FALSE    TRUE  FALSE
10    FALSE   FALSE  FALSE

Converting the file from ISO-latin1 to UTF8 (with Mac's TextEdit 
application) allows the file to be read in in its entirety, but still 
the Scandinavian character in the heading is coerced to a period '.', 
or two, in fact (i.e. 'mietti?' -> 'miett..').

Have I possibly misunderstood how the 'file' function should be used 
in conjunction with 'read.table', or might the problem with 
latin1-to-UTF-8 conversion be somewhere else? In ny mind, it would be 
most preferable if I were able to to operate with the same files in 
both MacOS-X and Linux.

Appreciating any help on this matter,

Message-ID: <C0B1CB7B.1676%Beyerj@students.uni-marburg.de>

Antti, 

I think I can offer some help. I can add the following for
   R 2.1.1 w/ R.app 1.14
   Mac OS X 10.4.6, PPC G4/400 (Oct. 1999)

If you are only interested in the solution, you can skip the following
report and jump to the last paragraph.

A tabulated data file with German umlauts in some column headers shows the
same behavior as yours, if I use your command
   data <- read.table(file("<filename>", encoding="<encoding>"),
   header=TRUE)  
or these variations
   data <- read.table(file("<filename>"), header=TRUE)
   data <- read.table(file("<filename>"), header=FALSE)

In all these case, the same strange behavior results
-- respectless whether the file is encoded as "latin1", "utf-8" or the
generic "Mac Roman"
-- respectless whether you choose UTF-8 with or without BOM
-- respectless whether you choose Mac, DOS, or UNIX line feeds
-- respectless whether you choose Apple's TextEdit, TextWrangler or BBEdit
for setting/changing the encoding (I prefer the latter for its fine tuning,
automation, and scripting features)
-- respectless whether you try to read the file with R on the terminal, or
with R.app (the Mac GUI)
-- strange enough, R *croaks about "incomplete lines"* even if there are no
accented characters (or multibyte characters) in your data file at all,
*just plain ASCII*... indicating that the problem may be located deeper in
the parsing process, not in the character set.


At this point I read (again) the "read.table" help page and found it a bit
misleading -- the sep=""-option reads as if by default the file is read line
by line (1st step), and then every line is split into columns wherever a
stream of white space is found (2nd step).
I think this is not the case. If you modify your command and explicitly add
the separator option (tab, in this case)
  data <- read.table(file("<filename>", encoding="<encoding>"), sep="\t",
  header=TRUE)  
  
  my file reads in without any problems, be it Latin-1 or UTF-8 (not sure
how to handle Mac Roman files, at the moment).
But keep in mind that multibyte characters are possible, but not recommended
in variable names (or column headers).

Hope this helps. 
Cheers 

Joerg

D,

As noted by Stefano, installation should be as simple as downloading the .dmg and clicking on the installer. 

If your questions are about R in general, 3 books that have helped me or people in my lab that are learning R are:

1) "Introductory Statistics with R" by Peter Dalgaard
A quick introduction for people that know some basic stats.

2) "Statistics : An Introduction using R" by Michael J. Crawley
Teaches some stats along the way.

3) "Statistical Computing : An Introduction to Data Analysis using S-Plus" by Michael J. Crawley
More in depth than the two above.

There are a number of other excellent books out there (see link below); I list the ones above because those are what I happen to have used.

Is there a means to provide a title for a Quartz window?
When running code that creates lots of plots, it would be
nice to be able to choose the desired window based on its
title rather than attempting to remember the associated
window number. Even better if the Window menu could display
this information as well.

Updates to the documentation are always highly welcome (preferably as  
patches). The sources are included in the Mac-GUI sources in
Mac-GUI/docs/RMacOSX-FAQ.texi

Yes, now introduced in 3244: you can specify the desired name in the  
call to quartz, e.g.
quartz("My Precious Plot")
We have never used the device name, so now we have at least some use  
for it ;). Thanks for the request. Apparently the description for the  
`quartz' command is bogus as well, it is copied form the X11 device  
and the device parameter makes no sense at all. I'll think about some  
more reasonable parameters/description for R-devel.

Yes, the window title and the windows menu are directly linked.

Message-ID: <83BF8E35-CFF3-42AA-9C37-5BDCD29F0D49@jhsph.edu>

I'm finding some odd behavior in nls.summary() on my MacBookPro.
Consider the following code:

thedata <- data.frame(x=c( 4,  6,  8, 10, 12,
                           14, 16, 18, 20, 22),
                       y=c(21.0, 21.7, 21.7, 22.0, 23.1,
                           22.8, 23.2, 23.1, 23.7, 24.3))

summary(nls(y ~ a + b * (1 - exp(d*x)),
             start = list(a=20, b=60, d=-0.003),
             data = thedata))

In the R GUI on the Mac, I get the following results:

   Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)
a 20.31317    0.56571  35.907 3.37e-09
b 11.20556   18.93357   0.592    0.573
d -0.01851    0.04064  -0.455    0.663

If I run R from the command line, the SEs for a and b give relatively
random results; if I run the code twice in a row fast, I get the same
results (though they differ from the above).  If I wait a bit and run
it again, I get different results.  Here are two examples:

   Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)
a 20.31317   10.37548   1.958   0.0911
b 11.20556    7.82498   1.432   0.1952
d -0.01851    0.04064  -0.455   0.6625

   Estimate Std. Error t value  Pr(>|t|)
a 20.31317    4.99515   4.067   0.00477
b 11.20556    1.33990   8.363 0.0000686
d -0.01851    0.04064  -0.455   0.66254

Note that with the same version of R in Linux, I get the (apparently
correct) result that the R GUI gives.

Does anyone have any idea what might be happening?

My version of R is the following (and I'm running MacOS ver 10.4.6):
                _

on a G5 this behaviour is _not_ found (using 2.2.0., I admit...):

I copied your code from the mail window into a Terminal and ran it a few 
times. I got always your "GUI" results. just as a info.

by-the-by: the model is no good for the data: the exponential term is 
completely unidentifiable in the data  which essentially follow a 
straight line (the result for `d' of 400% std. dev. shows this as well).

Karl,
this is something almost "impossible" (please not the quotes) to  
happen. The R GUI and the cmd line R version are the same R.
Just an easy check: could you run sessionInfo() on both R with and  
without GUI?

Dear colleagues,

With the help of a colleague of mine here in Helsinki (Seppo Nyrkk?) 
who looked at the innards of the R source code for Mac it turned out 
that this was in the end indeed an issue concerning the Mac locale and 
its settings and not R.

Though we had tried this earlier by changing the LANG variable to 
'fi_FI', we hadn't looked hard enough in the available encodings (with 
locale -a) to select the exactly correct value, being:

LANG=fi_FI.IS08859-1; 
export LANG;

With this configuration R was able to happily read in my original 
table with the Scandinavian characters in the header, without no fuss.

Thanks for your advice, and wishing all a good Midsummer,

         -Antti Arppe

I would have thought so, and so I find this rather disturbing.
In both cases I get the following:

Version 2.3.1 (2006-06-01)
i386-apple-darwin8.6.1

attached base packages:
[1] "methods"   "stats"     "graphics"  "grDevices" "utils"      
"datasets"  "base"

other attached packages:
   broman      qtl
"0.13-1" "1.03-3"

If I detach all of the packages except "stats" and "base", I still  
have the
same problem.

Right; I included just a bit of data that showed the problem.

Dear Friends,

Rob Goedeman kindly responded to a request for help because Rcmdr was  
not running properly on my machine. Because I had installed TclAqua  
in an attempt to remedy earlier failures to run Rcmdr he suggested  
the following:

I followed his advice. However, it looks like tcltk is fine, but  
there still is a problem:

************************************************************************

The failure isn't complete, however. There does appear an 'R  
Commander' X window. I can pull down menus. For example, I tried the  
menu: 'Data:Data in packages:Read dataset from an attached package...'
I chose the 'Adler' dataset from the package 'car'. Nothing happened  
(except for the spinning ball) until I cancelled the request in the  
'Read Data from Package' window, after which my console showed:

Hi Michael,

Can you check if the following packages are installed:

abind, car, effects, lmtest, multcomp, mvtnorm, relimp, sandwich,  
strucchange, and zoo

Furthermore, it might help for now to remove the existing .RData.

Rob

Some of the packages were not installed, so I did that, and  
removed .RData.

All's well. Thanks so much.

Rcmdr installs and runs fine for me (assuming you have accepted that  
it should install all the dependencies for you), but I always get  
this error inside Rcmdr's window: WARNING: The rgl package is absent;  
3D plots are unavailable.  And, I have no idea how one obtains and

Dear colleagues,

It seems like we found the solution to this latin-1-problem by taking a  
curved route. Here is a brief summary of my observations and my  
checklist for running R in a latin-1 environment.

I hope some of you will find this helpful. A huge thank-you goes to  
Antti for introducing the R project to me with his Intel MacBook!



Things observed
---------------

I tracked down the possible parts of the source code where printing and  
reading input are implemented. I found that the only possible points of  
strange effects are at those, which use the POSIX library calls to  
functions such as "isprint" and "iswprint". These functions act  
run-time dependent of the current locale, and they check whether a  
character (may be 8-bit or unicode) is printable. For instance, the  
"non-printable" characters in table headers get replaced by "."  
characters in function "do_makenames", judged by the is[w]print system  
function. The string printing functions are written twice, first for  
the MBCS environments and then for the 8-bit environments.

I observed, while reading the source, that the R program binary  
supports multi-byte character strings (including utf-8) properly, if  
"support-mbcs" is enabled at compile-time. The R binary packages at  
CRAN have this feature enabled, so the problem is not in the  
compilation.

The R program decides whether to use MBCS or 8-bit support at the point  
when I start the program at the command line. The MBCS support is  
activated in the UTF-8 environment, e.g. when running in the "fi_FI"  
locale. Oppositely, the 8-bit support is activated when running in the  
latin-1 locale ("fi_FI.iso8859-1"). The locale check, implemented in  
file platform.c, is done by checking the maximum byte count of a  
character. If the count (MB_CUR_MAX) is greater than 1, the MBCS is  
activated at run-time, and 8-bit support is disabled, oppositely.

Then, by a chance, I tried: export LANG="fi_FI" ; bin/R
And I had a working UTF-8 session!

Antti worked out the right latin-1 locale name next day after lunch:
export LANG="fi_FI.IS08859-1" ; bin/R
And, behold, the latin-1 characters were available!


Pre-flight checklist
--------------------

The required steps for running R internationally in Mac OS X.

Step 1:

Setting the Mac OS X terminal to the right encoding. Command-I opens  
the terminal info window. The "display" tab contains the character  
encoding drop-down list. I make my choice between ISO Latin-1 and  
UTF-8. In the "emulation" tab there is an option for "escaping  
non-ascii characters". I have had trouble with this option in  
interactive character-based programs, so I have disabled this.


Step 2:

Enabling the readline library to read international input. The mac os x  
shell is bare in the internationalization aspect. I chose to write  
".inputrc" file as follows:

$ cat .inputrc
set input-meta on
set output-meta on
set convert-meta off

Thanks go to our unix-aware staff at the department of linguistics.  
This allows me to use 8-bit and utf-8 characters at the command prompt,  
too! Just echo some non-ascii characters to be sure of this.

$ echo "h?h??"
h?h??

Seems to be working, so we'll proceed to step 3.


Step 3:

The default locale in the OS X shell is bare "C", which gives only the  
basic 7-bit support without any international extras. (Here bin/R is  
the relative pathname to my R binary installation)

When using utf-8 files, I have to command
export LANG=fi_FI ; bin/R.

When using latin-1 files, I say
export LANG="fi_FI.IS08859-1" ; bin/R


Testing
-------

Now we have the R running in the terminal, supporting latin-1  
characters!

 > print("?")
[1] "?"

 > t<-read.table("foo.txt",header=TRUE)
 > t
   ??? p??
1 m?? f??
2 r?? f??




To be explored
---------------

- R.app

I haven't yet run the graphical user interface R.app, but its  
objective-c source code suggests that the input given to the R "core"  
binary and the output received from the binary are handled in the UTF-8  
way. Whether the R core runs in MBCS or 8-bit environment or in the "C"  
locale is not clear.

- X11 support

I installed the required f77 compiler provided by the "fink" package,  
but I didn't yet check whether I can plot latin-1 characters  
graphically. I'll need to install the X11 headers and shared libraries  
before enabling the X11 support.



with best regards

   Seppo Nyrkk?

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Problems with package gmp
Message-ID: <D9011765-CC15-4665-A43C-00FE6AC3FE5C@mac.com>

I have just upgraded OS X from Panther to Tiger 10.4.7, and R from  
2.2.1 to 2.3.1. I installed several packages (at system level), but  
gmp will not load:

 > library(gmp)
Error in dyn.load(x, as.logical(local), as.logical(now)) :
	unable to load shared library '/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/ 
Versions/2.3/Resources/library/gmp/libs/ppc/gmp.so':

library/gmp/libs/ppc/gmp.so, 6): Symbol not found: ___gmpz_import
   Referenced from: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.3/ 
Resources/library/gmp/libs/ppc/gmp.so
   Expected in: flat namespace
Error in library(gmp) : .First.lib failed for 'gmp'

gmp.so is present in the specified location, and gmp ran fine under  
my previous setup.

I would greatly appreciate some help.

Hi,

Assuming you are using R.app, tcltk does work on Mac OS 10.4.6 and  
R-2.3.1.

1) Is X11 installed/working on your system (in /Applications/Utilities)?
2) Did you install tcltk while installing R.app (check customize  
button in
lower left corner during 5th step of install of R)?

Regards,
Rob

Please make sure you installed the latest gmp properly. I cannot  
reproduce the problem on my machine (G5 with 10.4.6). If the error  
still persists, please send us more details about your setup. Also it  
is often helpful to test it from the command line, starting R with
  DYLD_PRINT_LIBRARIES=1 R
to verify that the correct libraries are loaded. It should show:

 > library(gmp)
dyld: loaded: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/library/gmp/ 
libs/ppc/gmp.so
dyld: loaded: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.3/Resources/ 
lib/libstdc++.6.dylib, cpu-sub-type: 0

Attaching package: 'gmp'

Cheers,
Simon

I installed

Version 2.3.1 (2006-06-01)


only yesterday and Tk is working again. note, though, that this is the 
X11 version, i.e. the Tk widgets pop up only if the X-server is running.

if one of the 'informed' guys is reading this by some chance, two questions:

1.
is their a canonical way to avoid installing Tk again (in the 
R.framework??) and to use, instead, an already existing Tk? this was 
beyond me during the last releases (where Tk actually did'nt work with 
R, though it was running perfectly with other apps).

2.
would it be possible to use a OSX native (aqua) Tk lib as an alternative 
to the X11 one? if yes, how?

regards,
joerg

Adam, 

your problem is not Mac-specific, therefore I fear noone here will answer
your post and address your problem.
You probably will have more success if you re-post your report on the more
general r-help list.
Another alternative is the r-sig-db list, were database-specific questions
are discussed. 

Oh, and by the way -- sorry that I cannot offer you more (but I'm generally
interested in this kind of problem, too).

Cheers

Joerg

This is not an R problem, this is a problem with some SIMBL-based  
InputManager you've installed.

I tested R from the command line as you suggest. Neither library is  
loaded. I have installed GNU MP release 4.2.1 from the gmp website in  
the default location (under /usr/local), and I installed the R binary  
package gmp. (I also have the fink gmp package installed under /sw).  
I tried installing the R package from source, but it could not find  
the MP library. I am running an iMac G5 with 10.4.7.
