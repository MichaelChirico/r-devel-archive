Not really, it's typically a matter of seconds. Try using a different mirror.

The distance doesn't matter at all - it's more a matter of how good connection does the server have, how heavy is the load etc. Essentially anywhere in the US is just fine.

If you have problems with any mirror then the issue may be with your local machine or its internet connection...

Did you try simply using install.packages(...) in command-line R? That will give you progress and thus show where it's taking so long ...

There is a problem in the BayesXsrc package so you may want to report it to the authors - it is circumventing the R package build system to build a binary without checking for the availability of the libraries it uses. Unfortunately it goes undetected in make check, because the CRAN build machine happens to have local versions of those libraries outside of R as well, but users don't. Only package libraries (.so and .dylib) are guaranteed to be re-mapped to use R's internal libraries.
(Besides, it segfaults on me when run on the command line even on the build machine).

Ideally, the authors of BayesXsrc should use regular package library to run their code so it is covered by our build system and tests, but if they need a separate executable (and don't want to run it off the package shared object itself), they should make sure that they provide any dependencies needed for the binary (I would also suggest using Makevars since they are effectively turning their Makefile into Makevars by using shell expansion of env vars which is inherently fragile and unreliable (any parameter containing a space will break it) instead of the make variables which they would have at their disposal in Makevars).


That said, a dirty hack to work around at least the problem you are seeing is to create a symlink to expose R's readline in the local system libraries like this:
sudo ln -s /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/lib/libreadline.5.2.dylib /usr/local/lib/libreadline.5.2.dylib

Cheers,
Simon

Yes,

you can set it by executing the following line in the Terminal:

defaults write org.R-project.R  "R Script Editor tab width" 8

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] as.Date() does not work with format %B
Message-ID: <1339233458.24929.12.camel@milan>

Hi!

I currently experience a problem with my package tm.plugin.factiva on
Macs. I need to parse a locale-dependent date string into a proper Date
object. It works fine on Linux and Windows, but on a Mac I've tested,
parsing dates containing the %B format (for full month name) does not
work.

It's very easy to reproduce (here in French, but it's straightforward to
adapt it to your locale):

> # Check that formatting dates works: OK
> strftime("1998-07-09", "%d %B %Y")
[1] "09 juillet 1998"
> # Try to convert the same string to a date: FAIL
> as.Date("9 juillet 1998", format="%d %B %Y")
[1] NA
> as.Date("09 juillet 1998", format="%d %B %Y")
[1] NA

The locale looks good:
> Sys.getlocale()
[1] "fr_FR.UTF-8/fr_FR.UTF-8/fr_FR.UTF-8/C/fr_FR.UTF-8/fr_FR.UTF-8"

And setting LC_TIME manually does not change anything:
> Sys.setlocale("LC_TIME", "fr_FR.UTF-8")
[1] "fr_FR.UTF-8"
> as.Date("9 juillet 1998", "%d %B %Y")
[1] NA

FWIW, I've also tried using strptime() instead of as.Date(), and the
problem is the same.


This is with R 2.15.0 on Mac OS 10.6.8.

Any clues much appreciated! ;-)

Not that this is at all likely to be helpful, but it seems to be month

Looks like this is 

http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-bugs/2009-December/037796.html

which was fixed in May 2010, but apparently hasn't percolated down to the OSX updates yet. 
(Still there in local build on Lion, so not just CRAN binaries. Insert appropriate rant about Open Source and commercial vendors here...)

Summary of bug: strptime with %B goes through the months and checks for full name, then abbreviation. Problem is that "jui" of "juillet" matches abbr. for "juin"! but  "llet" mismatches %Y and we get the NA.

OK, much thanks for the pointer! As I don't have access to the OS X
machine, I did not play enough with it to discover only July has
problems.

I think I'm going to introduce a workaround for French, if Lion still
has the bug, it's going to be there for ages on other versions.

Thanks again.

Thanks, Hans for that taste of customization. And thanks for all your  
work on R.app.

Is there a more general list of features that could be adjusted? Is  
the Script Editor built on a platform that is more generally used and  
might have external documentation?

After looking around a bit more it looks to me that the Script Editor  
is its own entity. I found this list of PreferenceKeys in which "R  
Script Editor tab width" is one instance:

https://svn.r-project.org/R-packages/trunk/Mac-GUI/PreferenceKeys.h

Am I correct in assuming these are stored in a .plist file?

David,

Looks like it might be:

  ~/Library/Preferences/org.R-project.R.plist

The Property List Editor application that used to be included in OSX has been integrated into XCode, AFAICS, which makes it a bit more cumbersome to edit the file.

Regards,

Marc Schwartz

Hi,

suppressPackageStartupMessages works in the GUI version of R on my
Mac. But it does not work in the command line version of R. Could
anybody take a look what is wrong with the command line version?
Thanks!

(in which our ever beloved, user-friendly and helpful OSX Mail application has converted R's prompt character to a vertical bar, as if the ">" were indicating citation from a previous message. Therefore, it is not immediately obvious that the above command does indeed suppress package startup messages....)

It is my mistake for putting the wrong command. Here is the output for
suppressPackageStartupMessages in the command line version R on Mac.

I have had a second person to try it on his system. And he observed
the same behavior. Would you please try it on your system to see if
you get the same behavior?

At least in (even old) R-patched it seems just fine:

gdata works ok for me. Did you actually install gtools?

The 2.15.1 issue is probably harmless. (We really shouldn't be building packages with an unreleased R version, though.)

2.15.1 is announced for Friday... I think it's a bit of a glitch that CRAN is already automatically providing packages for it, but you are of course more than welcome to test the prereleases (from http://R.research.att.com/).

I suppose that this comes about from building packages with R-patched, which transitions directly into the prereleases for the next version.

Yes, this is a side-effect of that. I wonder what we can do about it - I used to build packages with released versions only, but then people complained that patched had fixes for some things they needed...

We could simply not update the version of R-patched used during the 
beta/RC periods: they are after all only about 10 days.

Yes, that would handle the formal issue of the version number conflict. 

However, there's a deeper issue which got highlighted by the identical() debacle in April-June: It seems that we can't guarantee ABI compatibility throughout the R-branch series (e.g., everything labeled 2.15.x). We try to ensure that the modified versions of R will run packages built with a previous version, but the other way around might not work. If that sort of thing happens in R-patched, midway between releases, then users could find themselves blocked from installing packages until they update to R-patched, which could be undesirable in corporate or educational settings.

Some R-core deliberations might be called for...

Note this only applies to binary packages: people can always install 
from the sources (trivially for 'gdata' since it has no compiled code).

My understanding is that the Windows' policy is to stick with the 
current 2.15.x release: 2.15.0 is currently used but once 2.15.1 is out 
packages will be built with 2.15.1 (and re-built if their dependencies 
change).

The 'debacle' was Bioconductor's lack of understanding of the 
assumptions of their own distribution model.  As we said at the time, if 
you want to provide binary packages that work under all of 2.15.x, you 
need to prepare them with 2.15.0.  But as Simon points out, that may 
stop binary packages being provided for some recent source packages.

Note that there are other issues here: as we have seen in the last week, 
updates and downdates to a recommended package such as Matrix have 
required other packages to be re-installed. It is not just the version 
of R that is relevant but also what other packages were installed at the 
time the binary package was prepared.

We may need to work harder to get people to understand that binary 
packages have 'use at your own risk' status.

Do the foregoing observations explain why I am unable to get any  
access to the binary CRAN indexes using the MacGUI installer? I've  
tried with three different repositories, so I do not think it is due  
to a scheduled weekend maintenance problem:

Warning: unable to access index for repository http://cran.fhcrc.org/bin/macosx/leopard/contrib/2.15
Warning: unable to access index for repository http://stat.ethz.ch/CRAN/bin/macosx/leopard/contrib/2.15
Warning: unable to access index for repository http://cran.cnr.Berkeley.edu/bin/macosx/leopard/contrib/2.15
 >

I _can_ see the source directories and install source packages, so it  
seems not to be a connectivity issue.

I started seeing this with R 2.15.0 , so I updated, but it continues:

 > sessionInfo()

(I normally use the CMU, Berkeley or Fred-Hutch mirrors, but I tried  
the ETH-Z site as well. The Mac R build was obtained from the  
att.research site minutes before the posting.)

go to your working dir, I assume that would be /Users/your_username

do

ls -a

if the file is there kill it, otherwise find the dir where you were working when you saved the session and go through the step above

Hi Mike,

The start-up messages in your email tell you that the workspace was restored from a file named ".RData"
and the history was restored from a file names ".Rapp.history".  Both of these are in the folder "/Users/Mike/Documents".

To delete them, open a terminal window and type
> cd /Users/Mike/Documents
> rm .Rdata
> rm .Rapp.history

Alternatively, this can be done through the GUI itself.
1. Start up R as usual 
2. delete everything from the workspace by choosing "Clear Workspace" under the Workspace menu item
3. make the empty workspace your new default by choosing "Save Default Workspace"  (again under the Workspace menu item)

To clear the history, open the history sidebar by clicking on the history icon (to the right of the color-wheel)
1. Click on "Clear History"
2. Click on "Save History"
This will prompt for a file name.  Apparently your installation is set to read the history from a file called ".Rapp.history" in your documents folder, so that is where you should save the history.

Best regards,
Susan

Message-ID: <27070068.59849.1340783111689.JavaMail.open-xchange@oxde02.ibone.ch>

Hello,
?
I was a way from the computer for a few days, noticed when I returned that
2.15.1 is the current version of R, but the link to a Mac OS X binary takes me
to a page that gives the impression that only a 2.15 binary is available for
that platform. ?I've checked the archives of the mail list and don't find any
mention of a delay of 2.15.1 for Mac OS X, nor, however, do I find any
announcement of 2.15.1 for Mac. ?Can somebody fill me in on the current status
of 2.15.1 binaries for various platforms?
?
Regards,
Richard

Hello Richard,

I have installed it just yesterday. I got the binary from the CRAN 
(mirror Lyon 1, France).

HTH,
Ivan

Ivan,
?
Thanks. ?I guess I was just experiencing a caching problem in Safari. ?After
restarting Safari I see that the ETHZ mirror in Switzerland is also offering
2.15.1.
?
