It may be worth mentioning that python and homebrew have removed all
dependency on Accelerate due to bugs and Apple's (lack of)
maintenance: https://github.com/scipy/scipy/wiki/Dropping-support-for-Accelerate

Message-ID: <E998AD8F-98B6-4719-8D04-465F9BE9705E@illinois.edu>

I?ve recently ?upgraded? to catalina, and compilation of my quantreg package failed with:

In file included from mcmb.c:11:
/usr/local/clang7/include/c++/v1/stdio.h:108:15: fatal error: 'stdio.h' file not found
#include_next <stdio.h>

So I?ve tried the following:

	1.  Upgraded R to 4.0.3
	2.  Upgraded the fortran compiler to 8.2.0 as suggested.
	3.  Attempted to reinstall command line tools with Xcode-select ?install.  This fails with
		a popup that says:

  		Can?t install the software because it is not currently available from the Software Update server.
	4.  Tried again to reinstall Command line tools 12.2 beta 3 from https://developer.apple.com/download/more/
		which successfully installed, but my stdio.h error persisted.
	5.  Following thread: http://r-sig-mac.29524.n8.nabble.com/R-SIG-Mac-fatal-error-stdio-h-file-not-found-td889.html
		I  looked at:

		yzzy: which clang /usr/bin/clang 
		yzzy: xcode-select -p /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer 
		yzzy: xcrun --show-sdk-path /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk

This is a common error after major macOS upgrades.
Install the xcode CLT standalone from Apple and try again. 
You might also need to install/link to the 10.14 SDK to get certain packages installed from source.

Roger,

the error points to an old local clang - did you remove (or move aside) that one? Check your /usr/local - you seem to have some old stuff there that is breaking. That would solve the original issue. You seem to have done a lot after that error, but didn't tell us what happened then? you can't have the same error if you removed it ;) 

Cheers,
Simon

Simon,

Thanks,  I still have the same error:

In file included from mcmb.c:11:
/usr/local/clang7/include/c++/v1/stdio.h:108:15: fatal error: 'stdio.h' file not found
#include_next <stdio.h>

I didn?t do anything beyond upgrading R and installing fortran 8.2.0, and the CLT 12.2.
but I didn?t remove anything, should I have?  I now see:

yzzy: which clang
/usr/bin/clang
yzzy: clang --version
Apple clang version 12.0.0 (clang-1200.0.32.2)
Target: x86_64-apple-darwin19.6.0
Thread model: posix
InstalledDir: /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin


The last time I faced this sort of thing James suggested this: 
https://groups.google.com/g/r-sig-mac/c/rZeYeiyyxtY

but the names and locations are somewhat different now, so I?m reluctant to experiment.

Roger

clang7 seems to be unnecessary for current R. It isn?t in my system and from memory was one of the things I removed to get everything working. This involved removing the clang and fortran that had been previously installed. I may have needed some other things but my systems will build your package.

Humm?  so I have now removed clang7 from /usr/local  and I now see:

/usr/local/clang7/bin/clang -I"/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/include" -DNDEBUG   -I/usr/local/clang7/include/c++/v1   -fPIC  -Wall -g -O2  -c mcmb.c -o mcmb.o
/bin/sh: /usr/local/clang7/bin/clang: No such file or directory

But unfortunately I still don?t see where R CMD build is asking for clang7.  I tried reinstalling R
after removing clang7 but this didn?t change the result above.  Nothing in my environment or
in .Rprofile refers to clang

My ChangeLog reveals that I had a similar problem a couple of years ago, but unhelpfully it doesn?t reveal
how it was fixed, only that the one C source file of the package was removed for a while, and then reinstated
after resolving a problem with header files for clang6.

Do you by any chance have ~/.R/Makevars ?
If yes does it define CC and CXX and LDFLAGS  with clang7?
Try removing them.

Exactly!!!  Thanks very much to all for your patience,  and especially for Berend?s suggestion.
All now seems well without .R/Makevars

Roger,

check your ~/.R - it looks like you may have custom ~/.R/Makevars which overrides the CRAN R settings.

Cheers,
Simon

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] R 4.0.2 GUI does not terminate with Cmd+Q
Message-ID: <1174507C-5A02-409B-B65E-8B86BBB02DE8@gmail.com>

I am experiencing some unexpected behaviour of R for R 4.0.2 GUI 1.72 Catalina build (7847): It does not quit properly when I am using Cmd+Q but instead halts and starts overheating my machine. I need to kill the process in Activity Monitor. However, if I type the command q() it seems it's doing the expected thing.

Any advice?

Many thanks!

I'm not seeing that with the current release, 4.0.3 R.app GUI 1.73 
(7892) x86_64-apple-darwin17.0.  So I'd suggest updating.

Somewhat relatedly, the build scripts also need a small update for Xcode 12,
https://svn.r-project.org/R-dev-web/trunk/QA/Simon/R4/src/consh.c and
https://svn.r-project.org/R-dev-web/trunk/QA/Simon/R4/src/fixup.c
need to #include <stdlib.h> for the system() calls.
