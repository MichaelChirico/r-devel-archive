Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Update underlying SQLite for RSQLite
Message-ID: <CALM-h97EzLwF5-dzH8FL=+2VU9ZGNbJ2n4E4TOMfU35HOinijg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I've just installed R on my mac and installed some packages, but I have a
couple of questions regarding updating a package.

I've found some instructions on how to update version of SQLite here:
https://github.com/rstats-db/RSQLite#update-version-of-sqlite.

However, it is unclear to me how this will actually update the underlying
SQLite engine used by RSQLite. If I execute the listed commands in R
console, it seems that all they do is to download the a version of SQLite
source code, and extract the files into 'src/' minus the 'shell.c' file.

I have two questions: 1. where exactly is this 'src/' directory? (is it
specifically for RSQLite only?) 2. After extracting the source files, don't
we need to compile them into RSQLite?

Best,
Merton

I have no idea. These directions may be Linux specific.

I would have thought so, too. This is the top of the description file for RSQLite
------------------
Version 1.0.0

Title SQLite Interface for R

Package ?RSQLite?

February 19, 2015

Description This package embeds the SQLite database engine in R and provides an interface compliant with the DBI package.
The source for the SQLite engine (version 3.8.6) is included.
-----------------

So that is (only?) 5 minor versions behind the current one: 3.8.11.1.

There are precompiled versions for each of the  three "standard" platforms at the SQLite website. I agree that unzipping a source version seems unlikely to change the compiled engine. If I were trying to be bleeding edgy, which I generally try to avoid,  I would have installed the appropriate binary:

http://www.sqlite.org/2015/sqlite-shell-osx-x86-3081101.zip

Those instructions are for updating the source package.  As RSQLite 
always uses the version of SQLite included in its sources, installing 
another version will not help!  You need to update the source package 
and then install it (which inter alia involves compiling the SQLite it 
contains).

The current sources are

http://www.sqlite.org/2015/sqlite-amalgamation-3081101.zip

and those instructions are not right, as that needs to be extracted to 
RSQLite/src/sqlite, not RSQLite/src .

You can use something like

curl -O http://www.sqlite.org/2015/sqlite-amalgamation-3081101.zip
tar xvf .../RSQLite_1.0.0.tar.gz
pushd RSQLite/src/sqlite
unzip -j ../../../sqlite-amalgamation-3081101.zip
rm shell.c
popd
R CMD INSTALL RSQLite

Works for me ....

Thank you for pointing out the error in the doc, Prof. Ripley.

I have built and installed RSQLite as per your instructions. Any way to
double-check the version of SQLite engine actually used by RSQLite? Perhaps
some attribute we can print out in the console?

Best,
Merton

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Package management in R
Message-ID: <CANKAE4t3jv8kU6X4WixzPGJqVnd9sQvMxd1_hXRMyJkr5F-Rng@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am new to R and just installed R and RStudio on a Mac.

I have a question about managing packages in R. I wonder if there is
the need and functionality to periodically clean up packages installed
via RStudio, e.g. older versions, files downloaded for installation,
etc. Does the update remove the older version completely before
installing a new one? And what about installation from source?

I ask because Homebrew (a package manager for OS X) keeps older
versions of a package and the files necessary for past installations
upon updates but it offers a command to clean up these stuff too. I
wonder if it is the same for R.

Thank you for your help.

Best wishes,
Chris

If you have older versions of R in a Framework directory tree, those packages are kept but if you update a package in the current major version it will be over-written. That is not a Mac specific behavior. 

You may be able to recover older versions with a Time Machine copy, but I'm not clear why you would want to do so. You can also pull source copies of earlier package version in the CRAN archives.

Thanks David. What if I set up my .libPaths so that all packages
(except those installed by default with R) reside in a single location
outside of 'Framework' directory? So when I upgrade R to a major
version (e.g. 3.x to 3.y), the new version will continue to use
packages at that location, would it be OK?

I am not worried about losing older versions or their source files, in
fact, I am concerned with the opposite - having older versions lying
around unused and I want to clear those up. It's good to know that
packages for a current major version get overwritten so no older file
is left dangling.

It should be "OK" if you use update.packages( ... , checkBuilt=TRUE), since there are often updates for packages when the changes in R are more than just bug fixes.

Message-ID: <79725D16-32B1-4779-B1D2-44D247586BD5@helsinki.fi>

Hey!

I have Os X 10.10.3 on MB Air and I downloaded the newest R version from CRAN download website. The software failed with the package installations and after working with the errors for few hours I decided to uninstall the software.

I deleted the .app files (R and Rstudio) and then removed frameworks folder too. I also removed the usr/bin/R and usr/bin/Rscript. Now the application doesn?t reinstall at all but just tells about an error which the installation software doesn?t specify. Same thing happens when I try to install and launch Rstudio. I also tried the --forget command with pkgutil on terminal with no success.


What shoud I try next? Or is there any chances to make it work without reinstalling Os X?


Best,

Juho Lappalainen
