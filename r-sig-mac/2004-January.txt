I posted this message before X'mas, just in case someone missed seeing 
it.

I'm struggling installing Rggobi on my Mac machine.
It was ok when I install ggobi. (with pre-installed ptk)
I did
./configure
make install

but when I come to install Rggobi.
R CMD INSTALL Rggobi
I got:

I'd suggest to ask ggobi people for help, because this has nothing to 
do with R.

As the error messages suggest you should have a look at the GTK 
extensions that come with ggobi. I recall that I had to patch a few 
things to make it work - but that was a while ago. (I never used Rggobi 
though).

 From what I can see you're using fink - I'm not sure if that ancient 
setup is still supported. In most cases it causes many problems. Last 
time I was working on ggobi it compiled well with native OS X libraries 
(i.e. the packaged OS X ports of those).

Cheers,
Simon

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] WINE
Message-ID: <BBB04632-501F-11D8-AB93-000A95A67E82@stat.ucla.edu>

WINE (Wine Is Not an Emulator) is a native interface to the Windows
API's, so you can compile and then run Windows programs on
the native system (so it's not an emulator such as Virtual PC, which  
emulates
and Intel CPU on another CPU). Wine runs on Linux.

There is now a pre-Alpha of WINE for Panther on Sourceforge. I'll track
it. Eventually it means that twisted persons, such as me,  can compile
and run the Windows version of R natively on OS X.

I stand corrected. It would be nicer if we could actually recompile  
Wintel
programs and not use emulation. That rules out using the commercial
programs, but it does allow all open source, and even the commercials
could recompile their stuff if they wanted to (not unlike using native
versions of the various toolkits).

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Problems with R/RAqua
Message-ID: <943B0C92-5048-11D8-B537-000A27D7D440@colorado.edu>

I work now for quite a while with the R Darwin/X11 version from Fink  
which works fine.
Today, I downloaded and installed RAqua from CRAN, which I can start up  
directly from the Applications/ folder. I also changed the links as  
recommended on the R developer page. However, when I try to start RAqua  
from X11, I get the following message:

> christof% R
> dyld: /usr/local/lib/R/bin/R.bin malformed library:  
> /usr/local/lib/R/bin/Help (n
> ot a Mach-O file, bad magic number)
> Trace/BPT trap

Any suggestions to what happened here?

Apparently, there are different paths in the terminal and X11:

> Terminal:
> christof% echo $PATH
> /sw/bin:/sw/sbin:/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/ 
> X11R6/bin

> X11:

> ~/usr/bin:~/usr/sbin:~/usr/local/bin:~/usr/local/sbin   
> /usr/local/sbin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/bin:/sbin/:/usr/X11R6/bin

In the first case, the R version (v1.7) from Fink is searched for, in  
the second case the newly installed RAqua version (v1.8).

My questions:
How and where can I permanently change the path for both the Terminal  
and X11?
Can I still use RAqua within Xemacs that I installed from Fink?

Thanks for your help!
Christof

sudo rm /usr/local/lib/R/bin/Help will solve this
This happens because you installed over an older version of R
It's even better to remove all of /usr/local/lib/R and ultimately you  
will
be happier if you remove /sw altogether (or rename to /sw.tmp)

You can use R in Xemacs just fine, but not the quartz() device from  
RAqua.

See my page http://gifi.stat.ucla.edu/pub for some details

Message-ID: <92D402B7-52A3-11D8-B30A-000A95A67E82@stat.ucla.edu>

I have been able to compile a version of VTK 4.4, the Visualization  
Toolkit,
with wrapper support for both (Aqua) Tcl/Tk and (Aqua) Python. This
includes the MayaVi front end.

I will wrap it in the next R/TclTk/Python distribution (by loading both  
Rpy and VTK in
a Python session you can combine R and VTK commands in a single
session, and thus do VTK and so on on R objects). Observe that
the current R/TclTk/Python distribution already has native support for  
Gtk+
(although RGtk does not work yet).

Observe that currently Ivo Dinov is teaching 130D for us, which
covers C/C++ but also VTK.

For VTK see http://public.kitware.com/VTK/
For MayaVi see http://mayavi.sourceforge.net//index.html
