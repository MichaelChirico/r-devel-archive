Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] R-latest.pkg link returning a 403 Forbidden error

I am not sure who has maintenance access to all the links shown by Bobs checker but they are dead since almost two weeks now.

Appreciated if someone could take this on - in the end it is the official resource for getting the R 3.6 branch for Mac (if one wants to avoid the GUI components).

Also the dead and outdated Rswitch links (last updated in 2011) do not add a professional look to the site. One could link Bobs Switch app to enhance the experience for R users on macOS:?https://rud.is/rswitch/

Patrick,

those links are dead for years now so nothing surprising - the binaries got lost in a server crash many years ago, so checking them is actually somewhat pointless.

Also note that some of them are not valid - not all builds are signed.

That said, I have removed those that are not recoverable and added a link to Bob's page (we talked about it for a while with Bob).

Bob, in your checks, can you, please, reduce it to valid checks, i.e. those that are actually expected to work? It seems to confuse people ;).

Thanks,
Simon

Also I'd like to clarify some things - the mac.R-project.org page is a *developer* page, so it is not intended for end users. It is provided for developers that want to test pre-releases and their packages. The content is *not* expected to be stable in any way shape or form*.

The mac.R-project.org server also provides a primary mirror of the official CRAN Mac master binary content in /bin/macosx. The CRAN content *is* expected to be stable and that is what this thread was originally about. However, some people then confused the developer page with CRAN - they are not the same!

Cheers,
Simon

* - that said, I do appreciate reports to me if something is amiss, since there are instances where I can fix things - but please think before reporting such things (e.g. if R-devel is broken and thus there is no binary, that's not something you need to report as that is expected).

Thanks Simon.
I am aware that this site is targeted to ?developers? though I?d argue ?end users? would also search for previous R releases and land at?mac.R-project.org and not necessarily jump away because they are no ?devs?.
Also the URL does not make it obvious that its for devs only. There is only one hint in the title of the page. Just pointing this out as hints for possible improvements, not as a personal critic.

Also on?mac.R-project.org?there is no link whom to contact / who is responsible for the content.
I am just pointing out that there is room for improvement which could help lots of people out there :)

Sorry for going off-topic - I?ll start a separate one dedicated to possible improvements of that page.

Please tell me in case I am wrong that R-sig-mac is the correct place to do so. I?ve seen no other reference/link/forum mentioning where to put feedback for this effort/site.

Thanks for all your efforts!
Cheers, Patrick

The CRAN content *is* expected to be stable and that is what this thread was originally about. However, some people then confused the developer page with CRAN - they are not the same!

Dear Mac useRs,

When I was still working on Mac, I used to love the RGui, partly because
of the color codes. Now that I work on Windows, I use R through RStudio
but cannot find a color theme that gives the same colors as the Mac
RGui. I am not very familiar with CSS styles so I don't think I can
create one myself.

But I thought the Mac CSS style might be available somewhere, and that I
could use it in RStudio.

Thank you in advance.
Best,
Ivan

The Mac R.app sources are available from 
https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/Mac-GUI-1.70.tar.gz.  However, I 
don't understand Cocoa apps enough to know where to look for the default 
colors.

Hi Simon,

I do not know how I should use that...?
Any more hint?

Thanks!

Neither does any of the rest of us, I expect... 

My guess is that first you need to 

- figure out how to edit RStudio themes. Some hints here

https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/115011846747-Using-RStudio-Themes

It is not completely transparent how to proceed (e.g., where are the existing themes stored??),
but it looks like the standard themes are accessible if you take the hint and enter the online tmThemes editor.

- figure out which elements in RGui correspond to which elements in RStudio

- figure out how to translate the colors. I would expect that the colorWithDeviceRed are easy conversions to
hex code (multiply by 255, round, and use sprintf("%X", ...), for instance), after which you can just type them in. 
E.g.,

colorWithDeviceRed:0.025 green:0.085 blue:0.600 alpha:1.0]

should become #061699

Dunno about colorWithCalibrated...

Is there any update on when R 3.6.3 will be available for download from  https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/macosx/ ?
It seems like there was a release of R 3.6.3 for linux and windows on February 29th that is available but nothing yet for Mac.

Yes.  We are aware of the developer binaries but were looking for an update on the official R 3.6.3 release for mac os.

It seems like there was a release of R 3.6.3 for linux and windows on February 29th that is available but nothing yet for Mac.

Lori,

as posted here earlier[1], Apple has tightened notarization requirements this year making it impossible for current R releases to be notarized until R 4.0.0 and thus the last Apple-notarized release is R 3.6.2.

If you are on a macOS version that doesn't require notarization, then I have put a binary that is not notarized in
https://mac.R-project.org/bin/macosx/el-capitan/base/R-3.6.3.nn.pkg
SHA1(R-3.6.3.nn.pkg)= c462c9b1f9b45d778f05b8d9aa25a9123b3557c4

I am currently investigating if we can enable the required restrictions on binaries and what implications for the functionality of R that will have and will keep you posted. 

Cheers,
Simon

Installed without issues on Mojave.

Reminds me that I may need some instructions on any required changes in the toolchain for 4.0.0 if I want to upgrade the build machine to Catalina before the release.

Mojave doesn't require notarization (yet) so it is safe to use.

I have now updated the CRAN main page with both the notarized version and the regular one. Catalina users must use the notarized version, they have no choice, and now Apple enforces hardened runtime for notarized software. The notarized version has modified binaries for all its components (including R, tcl/tk and texinfo), so there are restrictions on what it can do. It may limit interoperability with other libraries and software that is not notarized*.
Please note that R 3.6.2 is the last version on Catalina that uses regular runtime, Apple has closed the door so no new releases can use regular runtime on Catalina.

Those on earlier versions of macOS are safe and can use the regular version. You can install the notarized version, but you don't have to.

Cheers,
Simon

* - so far Apple allows certain exceptions, but without them *all* R packages (containing binaries) will have to be signed and potentially notarized. The same applies to any libraries used as well, so that will severely limit the ability to create custom packages/libraries by the user. We may want to think about including code signing into the R package build process (and building R for that matter -- currently all signing is done post-hoc).

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] dir only shows some of what's there
Message-ID: <0088f2c2-d576-151b-99c3-580924143a97@prodsyse.com>

Hello, All:


 ????? What can cause "dir" to list only 3 of 18 files in a certain 
directory?


 ????? I'm working with Jim Ramsay trying to migrate the fda package to 
GitHub.? The current status is at 
"https://github.com/JamesRamsay5/fda-revision".? The "data" subdirectory 
there contains only 3 files;? there should be 18.? I have all 18 in a 
local directory on my MacBook Pro running 10.15.3. I can see them in 
Finder, but I'm unable to get R to see more than those three.


 ?????? I do "(wd0 <- getwd())" and get:


[1] "/Users/sbgraves/Documents/current/R/fda"


 ????? Finder shows that this has subdirectories "data" and 
"fda2020-03-11/fda/data" both with 18 files and "fda-revision/fda/data" 
with only 3.? The latter is a current clone of 
"https://github.com/JamesRamsay5/fda-revision".? I copied files 
yesterday into "fda-revision/fda/R" and "fda-revision/fda/demo" without 
problems.? However, over the past few hours, I've been unable to copy a 
file one of the remaining 15 files from "fda2020-03-11/fda/data" into 
"fda-revision/fda/data".


 ?????? In R I tried the following:


 > (fda511old.data <- file.path(wd0, 'fda2020-03-11',
+?????? 'fda', 'data'))
[1] "/Users/sbgraves/Documents/current/R/fda/fda2020-03-11/fda/data"
 > dir(fda511old.data)
[1] "gait.rda"??????? "melanoma.rda"??? "nondurables.rda"
 >
 > (fdaRev.data <- file.path(wd0, 'fda-revision',
+??????????????????????? 'data'))
[1] "/Users/sbgraves/Documents/current/R/fda/fda-revision/data"
 > dir(fdaRev.data)
[1] "gait.rda"??????? "melanoma.rda"??? "nondurables.rda"


 ????? I checked "data info" on all 3 "data" directories.? The two with 
18 files show 18 items while the one with 3 shows only 3. "data info" 
for all three say "You can read and write".


 ????? Suggestions?
 ????? Thanks,
 ????? Spencer Graves

Hi

I know - homebrew is not a supported installation approach to R, but I am asking anyway:

Is there a way of installing r-devel via homebrew? Otherwise, what is the easiest way of getting r-devel on my Mac, without interfering with the homebrew install?

Thanks,

Thanks - done this (the tar.gz, as I don?t want to install it and run it from the downloaded location).

But how can I run R? I have the command R, but I get the message "?R.framework? cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified."


Any suggestions?

Rainer,

Unfortunately, this is related to the new security settings Apple is enforcing for installers.

The solution to this problem straightforward but annoying.

Steps to take:


  *   Open the Finder
  *   Locate where the installer you want to open is saved.
  *   Control-click the installer icon AND choose ?Open? option the menu.
     *   This will display a modified security warning with the added option of ?Open?
  *   Click Open to allow the installer to run.

Best,

JJB

Thanks - done this (the tar.gz, as I don?t want to install it and run it from the downloaded location).

But how can I run R? I have the command R, but I get the message "?R.framework? cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified."


Any suggestions?

Rainer

Rainer,

Be aware that the homebrew build of R used a different underlying C standard (if that is the correct way to name it?) which may cause issues when compiling certain packages from source.
I think most people in this mailing list do not recommend it.
In addition, you might want to change your compiler to an openmp enabled clang one.

I use a small script which installs R-dev:

wget https://mac.r-project.org/el-capitan/R-devel/R-devel-el-capitan-sa-x86_64.tar.gz
sudo tar fvxz R*.tar.gz -C /
rm R-devel-el-capitan-sa-x86_64.tar.gz

Cheers, Patrick

Thanks Patrick. This is working, and I can start r-devel.

I am aware that some say that there are problems with homebrew, but I have never experienced any. 

Thanks,

Rainer

Message-ID: <CANk-X-26cMc8DxsCcMxGszrEVvMreZHJGuoH95HLV8Ri1hF_4w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I wanted to install R 4.0.0 on my Mac (Mojave) to test  some of my packages
with the development version before it is released. I saw that
https://mac.r-project.org/ is recommended to get a pkg or tar.gz file with
the latest version. However, the R-devel version linked there points to
3.6.3.

Is that the expected behavior? Am I right then, that I will have install R
4.0.0 from source? And if so what is the recommended tool chain at the
moment for doing so?

Best Regards,
Constantin Ahlmann-Eltze

Constantin,
 
no, as you can see from the log the regression tests failed for R-devel, so it doesn't currently build. You'll have to wait until that has been fixed.

FWIW, r-devel builds happily on my machine (MB Air '19, Mojave, clang8, gfortran 6.1.0 from CRAN), regression tests and all.

Even if the R-devel build failed for a day, why does the tarball link/contain the R 3.6 source then?

I update my R-devel install every few days automatically and would not notice that I suddenly got R-release via that URL.
Rather I would prefer a 404 or (better) the latest successful R-devel build?

@Simon
Clarification would be appreciated.

Cheers, Patrick

This seems to have been resolved at this point. I think "last successful" actually is the expected modus operandi, something just got messed up (the r-devel SVN has never contained the 3.6.3 version label, it is always "x.y.0 under development"). 

Another question is whether a failed regression test is reason enough to hold back the entire .pkg build, given that it is already by definition unstable. For source tarballs, I don't even check beyond being able to actually build the things, on the premise that it is often more important to get code tested in other areas than to fix a failing regression test.

Notice that we go to 4.0.0 alpha tomorrow so presumably an R-4-0-branch entry should arrive on mac.r-project.org shortly.

tried tar with both the r-project instruction:

tar -xvzf ~/Downloads/R-devel-el-capitan-sa-x86_64.tar.gz

cheers, tim

[moving to R-SIG-Mac where it belongs]

Winston,

the error in the issue 
https://github.com/rstudio/httpuv/issues/260
seems to come from libuv itself - possibly a compatibility issue with the latest Apple Security framework.

The issue in 
https://github.com/RcppCore/Rcpp/issues/1046
is genuine and a bug in Rcpp as pointed out by Kevin. My understanding is that it was merged (I was following it on Rcpp mailing list and it looked that it's taken care of).

Please note that another important factor is SDK used - the CRAN El-Capitan builds are done against the 10.11 SDK:

$ ls -l /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/
total 8
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel   15  6 Apr  2019 MacOSX.sdk -> MacOSX10.11.sdk
drwxr-xr-x  5 root  wheel  170  7 Aug  2017 MacOSX10.11.sdk

The R 4.0.0 builds will be done against the 10.13 SDK. You can check against later SDKs to make sure your package doesn't break on deprecated features, but generally, the CRAN builds are conservative to make sure the binaries run on older systems since not all users upgrade to the latest macOS (for a very good reason as we've seen with the carnage caused by Catalina). 

To make it very clear, CRAN's goal is not to detect incompatibilities with latest SDK, but rather to provide stable binaries, so if a package breaks outside of CRAN, it is wise for the package developers to fix such issues, but fortunately they don't affect the availability on CRAN. That is also one of the reasons why CRAN is more stable than the 3rd party package managers.

Cheers,
Simon

Tim,

thanks, now updated. R 3.6.3 was a bit problematic due the Apple changes, notarization and Catalina issues, but hopefully things have calmed down by now.

Thanks,
Simon

Hi all:
I am looking for a high end performance desktop/laptop for statistical
simulations. I typically run hundreds of thousands of simulations using
JAGS and other packages. Any suggestions?

If I have a vector created like x <- c(5,1,9,3), how can I add values to

my Dalgaard or Crawley books, or in the help functions.? Thanks.

This question belongs on R-help:  nothing to do with MacOS.  But the 
answer is to use c(), or just assign to a nonexistent location.  For 
example,

x <- c(5,1,9,3)
x <- c(x, 10)
x[10] <- 20

This will result in x printing as

[1]  5  1  9  3 10 NA NA NA NA 20

Well, I think our mirror  https://cran.CH.r-project.org/
  ( -->  https://stat.ethz.ch/CRAN/bin/macosx/el-capitan/contrib/3.6/ )
would have helped too, as my rsync script
is "slow to delete" on purpose.

But that's not the reason for this e-mail: Rather to alert
people (SU !) to the fact that in unix-style directory look,
this is

Martin,

thanks, yes, el-capitan builds end with 3.6 so I have removed 3.7 and r-devel.
Your subject got me scared ;)

Thanks for the update. Do you mind me asking what these things are going 
to be replaced with? I was not able to find any 4.0 subfolder on CRAN 
yet (after trying a few shots in the dark e.g. 
bin/macosx/high-sierra/contrib/4.0/, bin/macosx/catalina/contrib/4.0/, 
bin/macosx/contrib/4.0/)

Thanks,
H.

You're right that the error originally reported in
https://github.com/rstudio/httpuv/issues/260 wasn't due to Rcpp. When I was
investigating the issue, I encountered a different error (the output of
which I posted to
https://gist.github.com/wch/c70b438381c9d2a8b1f917b054e0ba7e) which was
caused by Rcpp -- it's the same uuid_t/uid_t error that was seen in
https://github.com/RcppCore/Rcpp/issues/1046. More details on that below if
anyone is interested.

Regarding the bug from https://github.com/RcppCore/Rcpp/issues/1046, the
fix was merged, but it has not been released to CRAN.

It sounds like perhaps the 10.11 SDK may be a factor. I'll have to check
whether any of us who have tried to build these various packages have been
using the 10.11 SDK.

===========================

This is how I tested that Kevin's fix from
https://github.com/RcppCore/Rcpp/pull/1047 fixed my httpuv problem. I
installed the commit with the fix, and then installed httpuv from CRAN, and
that works. Then I installed the parent commit that Kevin branched from,
and then tried to install httpuv from CRAN, but that failed.

Here are the commands I used to test:
  # Installing Kevin's fix from Rcpp #1047 works
  remotes::install_github("RcppCore/Rcpp at 46bf2e2")
  install.packages("httpuv", type = "source")

  # Doesn't work (this is the parent of the 46bf2e2)
  remotes::install_github("RcppCore/Rcpp at 68a5489")
  install.packages("httpuv", type = "source")  # Results in the
uuid_t/uid_t errors

Catalina).

also one of the reasons why CRAN is more stable than the 3rd party package
managers.

(it would take over 24h - currently the nightly build of packages takes
16-22 hours), but we're currently building a new setup for R 4.0.0 on new
hardware and as a part of it we are planning to setup a "mac-builder"
similar to what is currently available for Windows.

Rcpp, but so far no one actually posted details of what is breaking (nor do
your links include any actual details on this). I'd love to help, but the
lack fo a useful report makes this impossible. If you have any actual
leads, please post them. The CRAN machine uses the tools that are available
on CRAN: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools/ (clang-7 and
gfortran-6.1 for 3.6.x)
