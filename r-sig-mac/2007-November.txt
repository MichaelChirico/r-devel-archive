You have to get R-devel to get 64-bit Quartz support (which is what  
fails for you down there). Old Quartz device was Carbon-based and  
Carbon was removed in Leopard (for 64-bit). The new Quartz from R- 
devel is Cocoa-based.

Um - what exactly? It should be really straight-forward if you use - 
arch x86_64 ... Readline is the only optional thing and you can use  
our binary as it contains all four architectures (yes even R 2.5 had  
quad-arch readline ;)).

Cheers,
Simon

Hi All

I am helping organize a course where we will use Rgraphviz. One of  
our future participants are using an Intel Macbook and has trouble  
installing Rgraphviz. Clearly my possibilities for probing around are  
rather limited since the course has not started, but this is what he  
reports doing:

1) Install Graphviz 2.12 from Simon's binary
2) Install the binary build of Rgraphviz from the most recent version  
of Bioconductor. This is version 1.16.0

He gets the following error

> Error in dyn.load(file, ...) :
>   unable to load shared library '/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/ 
> Versions/2.6/Resources/library/Rgraphviz/libs/i386/Rgraphviz.so':

So it seems that something is broken, at least for an out of the box  
installation.

Just checking if anyone knows anything

Kasper,

libltdl is a system library. It is present on all Tiger systems I  
could find. However, there are chances that it may be part of the  
developer tools (Xcode). I don't have any Macs without Xcode, so I  
cannot verify this. At any rate, my advice would be
- update to the latest available version of the OS
- install Xcode (preferably 2.4.1 or 2.5)

Cheers,
Simon

Thanks Simon

The user in question did not have Xcode installed. He used Xcode  
2.4.1 from the installation DVD, and it is working now. So I guess  
one could add Xcode to the requirements for the Graphviz build.

This was a major source of confusion at a recent Bioconductor Workshop (early
October, Chicago).  Anyone who had Xcode was fine, but anyone who didn't had
to wait for the 900+ mb download of Xcode as no one was walking around with
their OS X discs.  It would be very handy to have an installer that includes
the needed library if possible.

Message-ID: <A6B5A1CB-BFAA-4D3A-BCBF-77DA420200A9@gmail.com>

Greetings -- I've build rpy from svn (removing Rlapack from setup.py,  
as described in one of the postings), and can import it into python  
and plot.  However, plots go into an Rplots.ps file.  How can I teach  
rpy to plot in the native mac R and its lovely Quartz windows?  Or  
with X, how can I tell it to show a new window for a plot?  Is the  
window manager where plot window resides configurable -- can I choose  
either Quartz or X?

Cheers,
Alexy

Brendan,

if it "crashes", can you send me the crash log, please?

it works if we change manually the mac os x version in the two conf

looks like the problem is that devQuartz.c contains Carbon code,  
which is not supported in 64 bit as far as I remember.

See R for Mac FAQ - that contains quite detailed instructions.

For 64-bit Quartz you have to use R-devel, not R 2.6, otherwise the  
instructions are the same.

I tried to build R-2.6.0 for MacOS 10.3.9 on the weekend, but failed
miserably. It seems that the location of the failure is exactly the same
as in this thread that I found in the August archive of R-SIG-Mac. I
didn't find any continuation to this. Does this mean that the issue is
unresolved? I get a bit different messages depending on config switches
and when configuring and building in Terminal.app or in Xterm. The place
is the same: lapack.

A bit more information: I tried building first in another MacOS 10.3.9
box and there it worked smoothly (up to make, I didn't try make install,
since it's not my box). However, in my own iBook the failure is the same
as reported here. In retrospect, the most notably difference between
these two boxes may be that in my iBook I tried to keep up with R
versions and installed unofficial binary builds for 10.3.9 from
http://r.research.att.com/ as long as they were made available (up to
2.3.0), but the official CRAN release was the latest installed in that
another box. This may mean that some of the tools were changed under
way, but I don't know yet how.

Unfortunately I have no Panther box anymore (therefore there are not  
CRAN builds and I can't test it), but here are some pointers:

1) disable fink - it's known to cause many, many problems. At least  
for the config/compilation rename /sw to something else
2) when using --with-blas, you must use --with-lapack, otherwise it  
won't work. Either use vecLib for both or not at all.
3) --enable-BLAS-shlib is not intended to work on Panther, as 10.3  
doesn't support dynamic lookup

Please let me know how it goes.

Cheers,
Simon

Howdy,

I already had down points 2 and 3, and now I did 1 (disable fink). I 
tried with several versions of R, and the break was at 2.4.0: versions 
2.3.0 and 2.3.1 built OK, but 2.4.0 and later (I tried 2.4.1, 2.5.0 and 
2.6.0) all failed.

This was my build command

./configure --with-blas='-framework vecLib' --with-lapack 
--disable-R-framework --disable-R-shlib --with-tcltk 
--prefix=/usr/local/bin

The essential difference was that 2.3.0 and 2.3.1 honoured this and 
didn't try to build blas or lapack, but 2.4.0 and onwards tried to 
build it and failed. With fink they already failed at blas (early), and 
without fink they failed at lapack (late). According to NEWS file in 
the sources, there were big changes in build in MacOS at 2.4.0, and it 
seems that my dear old iBook failed to follow time here.

Here is the end of the failed lapack step:

Here some further comments.

The break happens at 2.4.0. R 2.3.1 still compiles beautifully. It seems
that there are two issues:

1. The configure script at 2.4.0 introduces new tests, and regards
vecLib BLAS incomplete. The configure ignores the --with-blas switch and
decides to build new BLAS and LAPACK. Regarding MacOS X vecLib BLAS
incomplete may be fair, but it is unfortunate, since vecLib is optimized
for the architecture.

2. Building LAPACK fails and so does building R.

I attach diff of configure output.

What is intriguing that things are a bit different in another MacOS
10.3.9 G4 computer: there also BLAS is regarded as incomplete, but
building of BLAS and LAPACK succeeded. 

Here the diff (I put it here since the mailing group has been anal with
attachments):

Dear members of the R list,

I am a biologist, with some R knowledge, but with a basic question! I 
want to read a csv file which is in portuguese, hence with accents in 
the column names and the columns themselves.

I have searched in the browse archives and couldn't find a solution.
The closest I could come up with was

Sys.setlocale("LC_ALL", locale="pt_PT.UTF-8")

I have also tried the options pt_PT.ISO8859-1, pt_PT.ISO8859-1, 
pt_PT.ISO8859-15, pt_PT.UTF-8, and en_GB.UTF-8. I got those options by 
typing locale -a on the terminal.

My computer is a MacBook Pro, Mac OS X, Version 10.4.10; R is 2.6.0; the 
computer language (in the system preferences, international) is set in 
English.

Thanks for any help,
Tiago Magalh?es

Dear Graham,

I use write.table to copy to the clipboard and paste into Excel on Windows and Mac.
Here is an example:

mydf=data.frame(x=1:10, y=letters[1:10])
write.table(mydf, file="clipboard", sep="\t", row.names=FALSE)

Kind regards,

Markus

In Windows you can use R2HTML to copy R output into the clipboard for
pasting into Excel as a formatted table, but this doesn't work on a Mac.

Are there any obvious alternative approaches to easily paste formatted
output into another application on the Mac.

Thanks,

Markus,

Thanks,

Should this work with something like the results produced by summary(x) or does it only work with data frames.

As always I find the help rather terse and impenetrable, but it seems to be aimed exporting data frames rather than analysis output tables - hopefully I have misunderstood.

You can talk to MySQL directly from R (using the RMySQL and DBI
packages) so there's no need to create an intermediate file. My SOP is
to query the database wth dbGetQuery and immediately drop the results
into an Rda file (just in case).

This is indeed a sane workflow - pretty much what I use for my own social 
network analysis work.  I happen to use postgresql rather than mysql, but 
that is somewhat tangential to the problem and occasionally driven by the 
kind of data I tend to like to work with ;-)

Looked at the igraph package?

Side-tip -- the sooner one starts writing functions for big blobs of 
analysis rather than do-it-all scripts, the happier one seems to be.  A 
lot of my old code is not written as functions, and frankly I seem to be 
putting a lot of work into converting it TO functions prior to being able 
to reuse it.  Oops.

As Byron suggests, pulling the data directly from MySQL into R is probably 
much simpler, and frankly is pretty straightforward.  You'll basically be 
writing selects that return vectors of data objects - pretty much what you 
likely already have in SQL, I would guess.

There is support for things like Harwell-Boeing sparse matrix format, but 
you can probably avoid the need for that.

The more you can do from within R, the more headaches you can save 
yourself.  R rules :-)

Nice scale.  Did I perhaps see one of your talks in Vancouver (at Sunbelt) 
a couple years ago?

Several people in my department do very similar work (CMC, SNA, 
computer-mediated discourse analysis, etc, ethnography, etc), and I would 
love to hear more about what you're doing.  Offlist, maybe?

  Use --without-iconv (or compile 64-bit libiconv from Apple sources if  
  you know how). Tiger has 32-bit iconv only, so you have either to  
  disable iconv support or to get the 64-bit version.
  
  Cheers,

###------------------------------------------------------------

Hi Simon,

Would you be able to give more guidance on how to compile 64-bit
libiconv for Tiger, or is it possible for you to package the
64-bit libiconv you built?

I can compile 64-bit R using the  --without-iconv Switch,
but 
make check
fails when the R iconv() function is encountered in the
make check tests.

I see this warning after running configure:
configure: WARNING: --with-iconv=no is deprecated and will be withdrawn shortly

So 64-bit libiconv apparently will soon be required?



Best regards

Steve McKinney

I have now succeeded in compiling R 2.6.0 on MacOS 10.3.9. The history
of the problems was:

1. ./configure test introduced in R 2.4.0 regarded MacOS 10.3.9 vecLib
as incomplete BLAS, and ignored arguments --with-blas='-framework
vecLib' --with-lapack, and decided to build dlapack irrespective of
configure arguments.

2. Building dlapack failed.

It seems that building dlapack failed only if configure specified
--disable-R-framework. With --enable-R-framework (default) the building
ended normally, and the resulting binary passed make check. 

The reason why I used --disable-R-framework was that I was trying to
build a command line version of R for /usr/local/bin and simultaneously
keep the old R-2.3.0 that works with the R GUI (R.app). Switches
--disable-R-framework --prefix=/usr/local/bin looked like a sensible
choice for me. With enabled framework I also can use the command line,
but now I need a symbolic link deep from the heart of the framework (in
non-default location) to /usr/local/bin/R.

The reason why I wanted to have only a command line version was that
R.app (R GUI) was documented to need MacOS 10.4.4 and building of R.app
is reported to need version of XCode that is not available for MacOS
10.3.9 (latest available XCode version is 1.5, R.app claims to require
XCode 2.4.0  --r.research.att comm page claims that R requires that
toolset, but seemingly it doesn't expect for the GUI). 

I did some other things under way that may have contributed to the
success, like upgraded my XCode toolset to 1.5 (although I had to
register and approve US sanctions against some countries). I also tried
this with and without fink, but the build succeeded in both cases
(except that html help pages could be built only with fink, since the
makeinfo is < 4.7 in MacOS 10.3.9).

You can get the sources from Apple and compile it:
http://www.opensource.apple.com/darwinsource/tarballs/other/libiconv-13.2.tar.gz

If you want to save yourself the hassle, my 64-bit build can be  
obtained and installed as follows:
curl -s http://r.research.att.com/libiconv-quad.tar.gz | \
sudo tar fvxz - -C /usr/lib

Given that it's compiled from Apple sources, it should be identical to  
the system binary (except that it's not stripped).

However, if you feel more comfortable just adding the 64-bit part to  
your system's iconv, you can do so by unpacking my version and using  
lipo to extract the x86_64 part and lipo again to add it to /usr/lib/ 
liviconv.2.dylib

Cheers,
Simon

Can you send me the config.log, please? Something must have failed so

You can have as many versions of R in the framework as you wish, the  
framework install will still keep the old R intact. Also the framework  
is built only at install time, so the compiled R is equivalent to non- 
framework R and you can move it anywhere you like (including /usr/ 
local). That's why I'm wondering why the lapack result is different -  
both builds should be technically identical, the only difference is  
the way the binaries are installed.

Well, I don't see the difference here - with installed R you need a  
symlink (or a copy which is the default) from a non-standard location  
as well ... :P The only difference is that it is done by make install  
(however, for the framework by the CRAN installer).

Xcode 2.4.0+ is required only for universal builds on Tiger and  
higher. On Panther you can use whatever Xcode works there, but given  
that we cannot test it, it's not officially supported. Also see the  
FAQ - R.app has an alternative project for old Xcode versions and also  
a way to build the unix-way with a makefile. I addition, the CRAN  
R.app binaries actually used to work on Panther just fine, because  
they don't use any Tiger-specific features. However, I don't a have a  
Panther anymore, so I cannot test either the build or the binaries, so  
I don't know if all that is still true.

Simon

Hi all!

I get confused wenn uninstalling R
and reinstalling it using the installer.

I removed
/Applications/R.app
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework
~/Library/R/

Wenn I start the Installer R-2.6.0.dmg
it wants to update my previous installation.

What is the cause of this behaviour?
Do I have to delete other files or directories?

Thanks for any help.

Try deleting

~/Library/Preferences/org.R-project.R.plist

I had a look at what AppZapper suggested deleting if one were to  
delete R.app. It seems to want to delete files which are totally  
unrelated to R.  The org.R-project.R.plist file was in the list.
Beware of AppZapper for deleting R.

I deleted the file,
but with no effect on the installer.

sorry if this has been discussed before...

I installed R on about twenty new iMacs in my department's computer  
cluster. On a few of those machines, the R console window does not  
have the Show/Hide history button at the top of the console window.

Any ideas about what might cause this glitch?

This is what the is shown during the installation:

Note: By default the installer upgrades previous R version if present.  
If you want to keep your old R version, remove R-Framework.pkg from / 
Library/Receipts before proceeding.

I would guess that the user on that machine has removed it from the  
toolbar (or to put it the other way round: the preferences tell R to  
not show it). Remove (or copy the same) preference file (~/Library/ 
Preferences/org.R-project.R.plist) to get the same look (whichever you  
prefer).

Many thanks Simon, this worked without hassle.

I compiled 64-bit R, but it failed make check.
First failure was in ok-errors.R, and generated this output
in ok-errors.Rout.fail

   aborting ...

Second error was in d-p-q-r-tests.Rout from this test:
   ## dbeta(*, ncp):
   a <- rlnorm(100)
   stopifnot(All.eq(a, dbeta(0, 1, a, ncp=0)),
             dbeta(0, 0.9, 2.2, ncp = c(0, a)) == Inf
             )
   ## the first gave 0, the 2nd NaN in R <= 2.3.0

and generated this
output in d-p-q-r-tests.Rout.fail

   In addition: Warning message:
   In dnbeta(x, shape1, shape2, ncp, log) : NaNs produced
   Execution halted

Everything else passed, so I'm not sure how serious these failures are.

I'd appreciate any suggestions about 
- whether to report this make check failure information anywhere else
- how to figure out what caused these failures (an inappropriate
  file somewhere in the path etc.)

Thanks again for making 64-bit libiconv available

Everything else passed, so I'm not sure how serious these failures are.

I'd appreciate any suggestions about

- how to figure out what caused these failures (an inappropriate

Thanks again for making 64-bit libiconv available

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] R-GUI after Mac crashes after 2 image plots.
Message-ID: <BDE091E3-BE9F-48F6-94B4-BF9F77E3B4F3@cancercenter.columbia.edu>

Dear R-on-Mac Community,

	I am using R2.6.0 with Bioconductor and I am finding that the RGui  
crashes after 2 image plots.
On the other hand if I use R from X11 it doesn't crash however many  
images I run.
Also the images form much faster in the X-terminal than in the R-GUI  
window.
I would like to have the  use of the GUI for pasting into the window,  
saving txt sessions etc.

Here is a record of the session:

####################################################
Are you interested in what I see when I click "Report". it is long.

I originally tried to debug this with the help of Martin Morgan,
who saw my post on the Bioconductor Mailing list. After
some effort, he referred me to this list with the advice:

"If you pursue it there, the best case you can make for a bug in the
GUI is when (a) no other files (.Rprofile, .Rhistory, etc) are loaded,
(b) you load the data into a saved session, so no C-level code is
being called before the image is displayed, and (c) there are no
problems with console-based R --vanilla."

Anyway I would appreciate any advice anyone on this list can give
me with this problem and will run any tests suggested.

THANKS!
Rich

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] gfortran question
Message-ID: <C359F431.2DDA0%tjohnson@src.riken.jp>

I've failed so far at getting R 2.6.0 (R-devel) to build as 64-bit on my Mac
Pro under Leopard, but at the moment I don't have time to detail my errors.

The simple question at the moment, since I was wondering if it might impact
building of this and other programs is the 4-architecture binary of gfortran
on the r.research.att.com website.  If you install it and run "file
/usr/local/bin/gfortran-4.2" in the Terminal, it reports a "Mach-O
executable i386" and a "Mach-O executable ppc".

Shouldn't "file" also report a ppc64 and an x86_64 executable if it's for
4-architectures?  That was the case for other programs that I've installed
that were for 4-archs.

Also, could someone please provide:

1)  Date of latest successfully building R-Devel for 64-bit on Leopard.  It
seemed like my errors were different for different dates, so it seemed
possible to me that new additions, irrespective of Leopard issues, to this
alpha development release could cause things to fail...?

2)  working configure commmands (in other words, should I still just be
typing in what's listed for building 64-bit R on Simon's web-site? with
changing "8.8.1" to "9.0.0")

Thank you!

Todd

No. R-devel compiles just fine and it did so for quite a while. (FWIW:  
R-2.6-branch compiles now, too.)

The configure "command" supplied with R works just fine.

rgl uses autoconf to build its configure script, and as far as I can 
tell the current version of autoconf (one version newer than what we 
used) knows nothing about leopard.  So we need to change the 
configure.ac input in order to make the above happen automatically.

Do you (or anyone else on the list) know what the change would be?  If 
you do, a patch would be appreciated:  I don't know much at all about 
autoconf (I'm a Windows guy), and don't have a leopard system to play with.

I'm not sure whether we want to do that. The current libGL in Leopard  
is simply broken (and that's just one of many things that are broken -  
the X11 supplied with Leopard is at best alpha-quality). The LDFLAGS  
above are just one way to work around it. IMHO a much better way is to  
simply fix the underlying problem:
sudo bash
cd /usr/X11/lib
mv libGL.dylib libGL.dylib.broken
ln -s /System/Library/Frameworks/OpenGL.framework/Libraries/ 
libGL.dylib .

... and while you're at it, fix libpng as well. Edit /usr/X11/bin/ 
libpng-config and comment out the R_opts line.

Along with removing /System/Library/LaunchAgents/org.x.X11.plist it  
should return some sanity to the X11 madness that coems with Leopard...

Cheers,
Simon

Simon,

Does this mean that the Quartz/Aqua support has been backported into 2.6?

I have a working copy of R 2.6 compiled for both i386 and x86_64 (as advised)
that is working nicely with bioconductor packages.

The 64-bit version does allow me to run the large maSigPro analysis without
malloc errors, which is great!

Does this mean we can use just ../R-patched/configure?  I would assume we'd
still need to generate both i386 and x86_64 versions using subdirectories and
specific configure calls i.e.:
../R-patched/configure CC='gcc -arch x86_64' CXX='g++ -arch x86_64' \
F77='gfortran -arch x86_64' FC='gfortran -arch x86_64' 'CFLAGS=-g -O3 
-I/readline/include -L/readline/lib' 'OBJCFLAGS=-g -O3 -I/readline/include
-L/readline/lib' 'LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib' 'FFLAGS=-g -O3 
-I/readline/include -L/readline/lib ' 'CXXFLAGS=-g -O3 -I/readline/include
-L/readline/lib' 'FCFLAGS=-g -O3 -I/readline/include -L/readline/lib' \
r_arch=x86_64 \
 --with-blas='-framework vecLib' --with-lapack  \
--with-system-zlib --build=x86_64-apple-darwin9.0.0 \
--with-tcl-config=/usr/local/lib/tclConfig.sh
--with-tk-config=/usr/local/lib/tkConfig.sh \
--without-aqua 

Is this not the case?

No, it's simply disabled. Technically speaking the 64-bit Quartz is a  
big and new change (it's a complete re-write of the Quartz device,  
hence aka Quartz II), so for QC reasons it cannot go to R 2.6.x. Also  
it's untested with the old GUI (there is a new Leopard GUI in the  
works that uses a different approach), so I don't feel comfortable  
putting it in the release. However, it's trivial to back-port if you  
desire so since the code didn't change, but then you may as well just  
pick R-devel.

It is, but you're using the same configure script ;).

My current Leopard flags are as simple as setting r_arch and adding - 
arch x86_64 to the compilers. BTW: there will be at least an  
unofficial Leopard nightly build soon (I'm just shuffling my machines  
to have one for the Tiger builds and one for the Leopard builds).

Cheers,
Simon

In earlier versions of R I used quartz save to save graphics from a script.
This no longer works.  What is the current mechanism to save quartz graphics
programmatically.  This should be doable from Applescript, but that's a bit
of work.

Thanks.

It works again - just use a more recent GUI (and I have posted a hot  
fix on this list earlier).

Ah.  OK.  Disabled.  Got it.

Will the 2.7 leopard universal nightlies also (please, please, please) be
compiled for x86_64?

Despite multiple protestations from very smart people who I hold in great
esteem, I am exceeding the per-process memory limits in 32-bit OS X during
routine analyses (ok, routine analyses with a great number of arrays), and the
x86_64 build fixes that.

Thanks,
Anand

Yes, that's the point ;). Only ppc64 is still unclear, because Rosetta  
doesn't support ppc64 so I'd have to use two separate machines.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Building 64-bit R on Leopard (Mac Pro): what worked for
	me...
Message-ID: <C35FAB2A.2DEE1%tjohnson@src.riken.jp>

I have spent the last few days trying to get R 2.7.0 compiled (with the
R.app functioning) as x86_64 under Leopard on a Mac Pro, so after having
success, I thought that I would share what worked for me. YMMV

Please let me know about inaccuracies or compilation flags that might be
better for performance.

It was previously mentioned on the list that we need to pass the
architecture flags (x86_64, ppc, i386, or ppc64) to each of the compilers.
Unfortunately, the FAQ, web-sites, and e-mails that give compiler flags only
explicitly set CC, CXX, F77, and FC, but leave out the Objective-C compiler
(OBJC), which appears to now be needed for R.app support, so

THE SHORT VERSION OF THIS EMAIL:
(as a supplement to R for Max OS X FAQ 2.5)

1)  You need Xcode 3.0 and quad-architecture gfortran-4.2.1
2)  Download the latest R-devel source(2.7.0) from
ftp://ftp.stat.math.ethz.ch/Software/R/
3) configure and build for ppc, i386, and x86_64 archs as in FAQ 2.5 but add
OBJC to the flags (example: OBJC="gcc -arch x86_64")
4)  Do FAQ 2.4 to build R.app


THE LONG VERSION:

First steps:

1) Install Xcode 3.0 (http://developer.apple.com or an optional install on
your Leopard DVD) and the quad architecture gfortran-4.2.1.dmg
(http://r.research.att.com/tools)

2) Download the most recent R-devel source snapshot (2007-11-11 worked for
me) from:  ftp://ftp.stat.math.ethz.ch/Software/R/

Comments on building R:
1)  If you just want command line R, you don't need a universal framework,
so can install using just the configure flags for x86_64  below, but remove
the r_arch=x86_64 or it won't run.

2)  As mentioned on CRAN's R Mac OS X FAQ, to build R.app in Xcode requires
a universal build of R.  However, R for ppc64 won't build on a Mac Pro, so
we need to build ppc, i386, and x86_64 architectures to be able to build
R.app.

Here are Terminal commands starting from your home directory.  You can
configure and make each architecture in three different Terminal windows if
you want to get done faster, but to have x86_64 be your active architecture,
it seems that you should "sudo make install" x86_64 last (R-Mac FAQ 2.5).
This last point might not be necessary now, but probably won't hurt.

Assuming you have now downloaded R-devel_2007-11-11.tar.gz and placed it in
a folder /Users/YourUserName/sources

make
sudo make install
_______________________________________


Building R.app

1)  Make sure R works from the Terminal.

2)  After getting universal R installed as above, then we have to download
the Mac-GUI and build it.
__________
cd
cd sources
svn co https://svn.r-project.org/R-packages/trunk/Mac-GUI
_________

1)  Start Xcode.
2)  Go to File:Open and open the R.xcodeproj in the Mac-GUI folder that you
just downloaded from SVN (i.e. /Users/YourUserName/sources/Mac-GUI).
3)  Make sure the pulldown menus at the top have Active Target=R, Active
Build Configuration=Deployment.
4) Click the "Build" button at the top.  After it's done, your should see
"Build succeeded" in the bottom left corner.
5)  R.app is built in: Mac-GUI/build/Deployment/R.app
Move it wherever you want i.e /Applications


I hope that this is useful to somebody.


Best wishes,


Todd

Hi Simon-

I looked through the TO-DO/BUGS LIST in the R GUI package contents, but did
not see these listed.

These happen on both my Mac Pro and G4 PowerBook using either your new R
2.7.0 Leopard framework (2007-11-08) and Mac-GUI rev.4853 or my compiled
build of R-devel 2007-11-14 with Mac-GUI rev.4854 from SVN.

1)  For every Quartz device window that I open and then close, a "Quartz"
menu  is created and then remains in the menu bar.
2)  From a Quartz device window, the command "Switch to Last Editor Window"
works but from the editor window "Switch to Last Quartz Window" does not.
3)  The menu command "Window/New Quartz Device" gives the following error in
the editor:
"Error in quartz(display = "") : unused arguments(s) (display = "")


Thanks for all of your hard work!

Best wishes,

Todd

Hi Todd,

R-devel is (as the name says) a development version. Among other  
things it  has a brand new Quartz device. The R GUI version 1.xx is  
currently not supposed to work with R-devel (it requires the old  
Quartz device) and we're building a completely new GUI from scratch  
(version 2.0) for R-devel. Although you can compile it, you wouldn't  
be too happy as it is still missing a lot of functionality. Once we  
get close to something releasable, I'll announce it and switch the  
nightly builds.

Cheers,
Simon

I was hoping for a little help on an issue I've encountered on the new  
operating system.  I have been unable to get all the way through the  
installer app.  It seems to function (although there are a few  
oddities with clicking the "continue button") all the way through to  
the installation type section.  Here the package names, their  
respective check boxes and the intdall button are greyed out.  This  
can be subverted by pressing "go back" and "continue" again.  This  
allows the Install button to be pressed. But upon pressing, a drop  
down warning pops up saying that a more recent version of the software  
is already present.

Any help you could offer on getting the software to work would be  
greatly appreciated,

Thanks for your time,

Please, at least visit the CRAN site before posting - it appears as if  
you have an old version of R that is incompatible with Leopard (for  
details look in the archives  of this list).

Please, please, do visit CRAN! This issue has been fixed, it's just a  
matter of downloading the correct version from CRAN!

Once again: Leopard users, please go to the CRAN page and download the  
latest R version from CRAN (the file is R-2.6-branch-43408.dmg). In  
fact I do recommend the update to Tiger users as well, because there  
were several speed optimizations since the R 2.6.0 release.

Thanks,
Simon

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Quartz graphics corruption
Message-ID: <C3632153.17CE%John.Daschbach@pnl.gov>


A problem with saving graphics persists through many iterations of the R
gui.  I brought this up some time ago but it remains a troubling issue.
Often, when saving quartz graphics as PDF the graphic is printed with other
screen contents.  Often these are part of the contents of the R console, but
upside down.  With the problem earlier it seemed that saving from a print
dialog instead of quartz.save(), but currently it is common both places.

Also quite troubling is the printed figure is sometimes missing elements.
In the attached figure both problems are evident.  In the one screen quartz
window from which this was saved as pdf from a print dialog there is a point
at 400 K in the Peak Frequency data, but it is missing in plot.  Also note
the print through from the console.

For this I moved the console off screen so it physically did not overlap the
graphics window.

If there is a work around I would like to know about it.  I've got a
manuscript to submit and as I have revised some graphics they are corrupt.

I am running R 2.6 with GUI 1.22-devel (4844).

The problem appears to have something to do with the interaction of  
the console (i.e. when there is something being printed) with Quartz.

I have found two work arounds that worked for me:
1) issue quartz.save(..) twice. The second output is usually ok.
2) use a function to generate and save the graphics.

The following is just a hypothesis. The key (AFAICS) is that when you  
type quartz.save... and hit <Enter>, the console is being updated (new- 
line) at the same time as the graphics gets plotted which results in  
the corruption (why, that's still a mystery as the corruption does not  
happen on-screen). By issuing two quartz.save commands the second one  
is likely to run after the console was updated, so it doesn't get  
corrupted.
Analogously, by using a separate function to both plot and save the  
graphics, the saving will occur after the console was updated.

R-devel (2.7.0 to-be) features a completely new, re-written Quartz  
device that doesn't suffer from this effect, because it uses Quartz  
Extreme instead of Cocoa.

Cheers,
Simon

Simon,
    Thanks.  But the original problem, and one that remains, is using
quartz.save() in a source("script.R") operation.  This could still fit your
explanation, but in a script that creates and saves ~50 graphics the
corruption can occur in different entries in the series and for different
numbers of graphics.
    Last time it seemed that saving by hand had better results so that was
what I was doing recently.
    However, my attempts so far at doing the following in a sourced file
have worked.

quartz.save("foo.pdf",type='pdf')
Sys.sleep(2)
quartz.save("goodgraphic.pdf",type='pdf')

It is a real mystery how this is happening I agree.  I think the corrupt
part is always upside down in the pdf output.

In the past I've had success by moving the console window off screen  
as you have done (or maybe minimising it). I would suggest bypassing  
the quartz display as a workaround, e.g.

pdf("output.pdf", width = 8.0, height = 10.0, onefile=FALSE,  
paper="special")

Hope that helps.

That's great news. Having official Fortran support would help a lot.

I can confirm that technically it should be reasonably easy - I was  
able to compile gfortran using Apple's sources and build (by adding  
gcc-4.2.x fortran code):

ginaz:bin$ ./gfortran-4.2 --version
GNU Fortran (GCC) 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5531)

This is the first time in a long while that we can use Apple's  
sources and build system for Fortran. (Apple's 4.0 branch broke  
Fortran beyond repair).

Cheers,
Simon

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] GNU Fortran 4.2, Apple build for Leopard
Message-ID: <B2F6549B-3F0F-42B0-9200-44BB6F7CFA4B@r-project.org>

For those interested, you can get GNU Fortran 4.2.1 (Apple build  
5531) for Mac OS X 10.5 here:

http://r.research.att.com/gfortran-42.pkg

This build will add Fortran capability to Apple's gcc 4.2 compilers.  
This is a real Apple-build of GNU Fortran based on Apple's gcc 4.2  
(build 5531) and GNU Fortran sources from the gcc 4.2.2 release (with  
minor tweaks to make them to live together). The above package just  
adds the Fortran files, so you must have Apple's gcc-4.2 already  
installed.

Requirements:
- Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard)
- Apple gcc 4.2

**Important note**: remove all other existing GNU Fortran compilers  
from your system (including those in /usr/local such as the one  
supplied with R!). Due to the way libraries are searched, if another  
Fortran is found and it has a shared libgfortran library then that  
library will be used instead of the static one that comes with this  
compiler.

This build uses Apple's drivers (supports all special Apple flags)  
and is fully universal (supports all targets) and can be easily  
uninstalled (using gfortran-4.2-uninstall script). It lives in /usr  
as it becomes part of the system compiler.

The really good thing about this compiler is that the resulting  
programs don't need any non-system libraries, so they are full self- 
contained. This eliminates the hassle with libgfortran.dylib,  
different versions of libgcc etc. And, of course, R was tested and  
works well with this compiler.

Cheers,
Simon

Hi

R-2.6.0,  MacOSX 10.4.11

I have just installed TeXShop 2.14 and the very latest version of  
MacTeX.dmg.
Upgrading is necessary for R to process my vignettes.

Now I am having problems with tex files that worked yesterday.  I am  
using
Sweave() to create tex files and the JSS style files.

My TeX files start:


\documentclass[article]{jss}
\usepackage{dsfont}

but TeXShop reports errors:

That's not a shorthand. `=` and `<-` are semantically different in R.

Alexy was asking presumably about shorthands that you press/type in  
the R Mac GUI which will result in `<-` being produced and those are  
<Alt><-> (this comes from Emacs' "_" shortcut which you type on US  
keyboard as <Shift><-> but given that the character _ is often used  
these days, we created a variant where you use <Alt> instead of  
<Shift>) and <Ctrl><=> (this one is simply a play on the equal sign  
and should make sense on other keyboards, too). The last shorthand I  
mentioned (<Alt>+<=>) is a direct translation of the ? sign (which  
you get in other programs when pressing <Alt><=>) into R code.

Cheers,
Simon

I actually like = because I screw myself over with things like
b[b<-1]=-1 on a regular basis. :-)

Of course, I also manage to screw myself over with (b = 1 | x == 2) so
perhaps there's simply no hope for me... Perhaps the Smalltalk-style
assignment ':='....

I think we may be talking about different things here.

[1] "a" "b"

So `<-` and `=` are *not* semantically equivalent (where `<-` and `=`  
represent symbols in the parse tree).

And I suppose the misunderstanding comes from the interpretation of  
`=` and `<-`: I meant them as symbols (which is what I would expect  
since we're talking about writing R code) and you interpreted them as  
operators (which cold be expected given that I used backticks which  
was not wise ;)). You are right that `=` and `<-` are equivalent as  
operators:

 > `=`(a,list(`=`(a,1),`=`(b,2)))
 > ls()
[1] "a" "b"

I hope this makes things even more clear ;).

Cheers,
Simon

Wasn't that ALGOL, really? ;) I must agree that I like it as well (and  
surprisingly it's still compatible with R's syntax - just in case we  
don't have enough assignment operators already) - but then, I'm one of  
those poor kids who grew up on Pascal, so I don't count ;). [Still, I  
wouldn't go as far as to re-introduce begin/end :P]

Cheers,

Guys, thanks for extremely illuminating discussion!  I always liked  
'<-' more than '=' and am staunchly typing it.  And of course there's  
a -> form.  This is beautifully asymmetric.  Now I can type <- in  
Emacs with '_' (in ESS) and in R.app with ?-.  (Now if only I find  
how to do it in TextMate!...  :)

Cheers,
Alexy

I always thought it was a common mapping for the 3270's left arrow key
(I also always assumed that's where S' <- operator came from) when
PC-style keyboards started dominating, the same as the ^ operator in
Smalltalk is a mapping to the up arrow key on the original keyboard. I
too grew up on Pascal (Turbo Pascal 3. Imagine my disappointment in
Anders Hejlsberg and C#, though it's now finally starting to Suck
Less).

I have it, and it talks to R.app beautifully -- but didn't find <-  
there.  So wrote a snippet!  Yay!

Of course, even using them as operators the parser doesn't think they 
are identical:

Ouch!  That's a good example of why people complained when "=" was added 
as an operator.  In your first expression, "=" is being used in two 
quite different ways.  (You can make out a case that argument 
specification is a little like assignment, since it creates an object of 
that name in the environment of the call, but that's pretty subtle.)

In a sense "=" inside a function call is not semantically an operator at 
all; it's absorbed by the parser into the internal structure that 
represents the call.  In contrast, putting an assignment operator inside 
an argument to a function is very different (and, IMO, something to be 
avoided in writing clear S-language code.)

The difference can be highlighted by looking at the parsed but 
unevaluated expressions in the two cases:

 > e1 = quote(list(a=1,b=2))
 > e1[[2]]
[1] 1
 > names(e1)
[1] ""  "a" "b"
 > e2 = quote(list(a<-1, b<-2))
 > e2[[2]]
a <- 1

The "=" has in a sense disappeared, only affecting the names attribute 
of the language object.

Again, the parser prohibition comes from catching a classic programming 
error in C (and another complaint about using "=" as an assignment 
operator).

while(flag = 0) { // of course, I meant (flag == 0)
  ...
  if(something(...)) flag = 1;
}

after which the programmer wonders why the loop never exits.

(These points recall some surprisingly religious arguments 10 years or 
so ago ;-))

Not only in S or R. I would say this should be avoided in any language
where the order in which the function args are evaluated is undetermined,
especially in situations like this one:

  b <- 0
  f(a <- b + 1, b <- 7) # will call f(1, 7) or f(8, 7)?

You mean, the loop will never enter.

The same as on windows, except with unix file specifiers

sink('output.txt') will place the output file in the working directory

sink('~/Documents/output.txt') will place the output file in Documents  
within your home folder

sink('~/Documents/myoutput/output.txt') will place the output file in  
the myoutput folder of Documents within your home folder, and so on

sink('/Volumes/Backup/output.txt') will place the output file at the  
top level of disk Backup

This would obviously be easier if there was a menu command.

Message-ID: <455D2D4A-E94D-4B56-9773-D83F91F384A3@gmail.com>

I'm trying to read a file in Windows CP1251 encoding (8-byte  
Cyrillics).  My Mac's iconv understands it fine under that alias.   
Alas, I get an error, invalid multibyte string when trying to read  
it.  When I convert it to UTF-8 with iconv and read without  
encoding=, all is well.  However, I'd like to be able to read it in  
as 8-byte encoding as my character arrays are long.  How can I verify  
the list of all possible options which the encoding= parameter takes,  
and what can prevent R.app from reading it properly?

Cheers,
Alexy

Hi List,

Since upgrading to Leopard, the font (or just style?) of my plot  
titles has changed. They used to be bold but are no longer. I tried to  
force it using:

plot(1,1, main=expression(bold("title")))

... but there's no difference to

plot(1,1, main="title")

Am I missing a font or has something else changed? I need the old look  
since I'm in the middle of a long document and I'd like consistency  
with the plots I've made up to now.

Cheers,

Demitri

I may be being terribly thick, but where can I get a binary of Apple's  
gcc-4.2 for Leopard.  I have searched ADC and cannot find it anywhere   
The gcc-4.2-5513 source is on the Darwin source code site but where is  
the binary??

Please have a look at the console (Utilities->Console), it should give  
a hint as of why it doesn't start.

However, you may want to upgrade to (just released) R 2.6.1 which is  
now an official release that was tested on both Leopard and Tiger.

I never try this form of installation (local), maybe if you select
inside Package Installer GUI the option "Local Binary Package" and
then click on "Install".

Greetings,

I've just installed R-2.6.1 from the
R for Mac OS X site
http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/
R-2.6.1.dmg

When I attempt to update bioconductor packages
R crashes on attempting to install 
http://bioconductor.org/packages/2.1/bioc/bin/macosx/universal/contrib/2.6/oligo_1.2.2.tgz

Is anyone else having this problem?

Is this an issue with Mac OS X R, or
with the oligo mac binary?  

Any opinions/advice would be appreciated.

I can reproduce this running R.app (see output
from R.app that I posted to Bioconductor at
end of this email) and also running R from
the command line in a Mac 'terminal' shell
as follows:

Greetings,

I just installed the latest Mac upgrade version of R
R-2.6.1

When I attempt to update bioconductor packages,
R catches a bus to crashville.

I'm using the recommended approach from 
http://www.bioconductor.org/docs/install-howto.html

i.e.

source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
update.packages(repos=biocinstallRepos(), ask=FALSE)


Session info and error report are below.  I'm not
seeing this issue in R news groups yet.  Anyone
else having this problem?

Message-ID: <0BE438149FF2254DB4199E2682C8DFEB0328A0B6@crcmail1.BCCRC.CA>

Hi all,

I've set up a .First function to run help.start()
but when I invoke R.app the .First function is not
apparently executed.  I've checked preferences and
documentation but can not find any indication that
.First() should not be executed.

Is this a bug in R.app, or have I missed something
about how to get .First() to be invoked when
I run R.app?  I include session information below.
When I invoke R from a terminal shell, help.start()
is executed and a browser window does pop up, but
not when I invoke R from R.app.

Any information appreciated.

Best

Steve McKinney

This is normal with a connection to a secure website.  Bioconductor
does not maintain the website at stat.ethz.ch.

This is not a problem and is not a bioconductor problem.  All web
browsers on all systems should behave something like this.

I tried that.  It doesn't let me select a directory or more than one 
file within it; even if I select exactly one file, nothing happens.

Hi Simon,

Thanks for checking.  I'm not sure
then why mine is not working.

I removed all objects, and set up your
example .First function:


  > rm(list = ls(all = TRUE))
  > ls(all = TRUE)
  character(0)
  > .First <- function() cat(".First was called\n")
  > ls(all = TRUE)
  [1] ".First"
  > .First
  function() cat(".First was called\n")
  > q()

I saved the workspace after q(), then started
R.app again (from the R.app icon in the dock).
The message does not appear, though the .First
function is still there:

I notice that your session does not show a message such as
"[Workspace restored from /Users/stevenmckinney/.RData]"

Something is different about our setup.

Any idea why I get this message and you do not?
Is your .First just saved in
~/.RData ?

No, mine is in ~/.Rprofile
AFAIR .RData is treated differently in the R GUI, because it is  
loaded *after* R has been initialized. This comes from the way R is  
started in the GUI, so I don't think you can use .First in the saved  
workspace.

Simon

Hi Simon,

Thanks for the clarification.
I've moved .First to .Rprofile and that
now works fine.

Could you add this information to the 
R for Mac OS X FAQ
and/or other appropriate R.app documentation?

E.g. add this suggested note (modified as necessary) to section 4.3.3 of the FAQ:

Note that R.app loads the user workspace .RData (if present in the startup directory) after R has been initialized.  Thus the user should put .First() and similar startup functions in .Rprofile rather than the user workspace.

(Also, minor typo: "If R.app is not runnig" should be
"If R.app is not running")



R for Mac OS X FAQ

Next: Resizing the R Console, Previous: Copy and Paste, Up: The R Console 
4.3.3 The current and startup working directories

If not otherwise specified in the Preferences (see Preferences), or if the specified path is no longer available, then the default working directory at startup is the user home. The working directory can be changed using the setwd R command or using the Misc menu item Change working directory. Finally it is possible to use a specific directory for a single R session by dragging a folder onto the R.app icon. If R.app is not runnig, this will cause R.app to be started in the directory corresponding to the folder dragged. The same can be achieved on the command line - for example open -a R . causes R.app to be started using the current directory as the startup working directory.

This feature is useful if you want different startup procedures defined by the .Rprofile; you can edit a .Rprofile (containing you personal initialization R commands) in a particular directory and use the Preferences (or any other method mentioned above) to change the startup directory. Next time you launch R.app the .Rprofile is read and executed by R at startup. This is the equivalent on Unix (or the command line) to launch R from different directories.

Note that R.app loads the user workspace .RData (if present in the startup directory) after R has been initialized.  Thus the user should put .First() and similar startup functions in .Rprofile rather than the user workspace.



Best 
Steve M

Strange

Same thing happens on my kids Windows computer

I guess I do not understand as I do several secure websites per day and do
not see this message

I thought a certificate on my computer checks the certificate on the sending
computer, if they match, page passes, if they do not match, message comes up
indicating potential trouble, so to go to a secure page I must install the
proper certificate, but I have no certificate for Bio nor can I find one

So I asked <bioconductor-owner at stat.math.ethz.ch> what to do...

Thank you

the ssl certificate on the archives at stat.math.ethz.ch is a 
privately-generated certificate.  that doesn't mean that there's anything 
wrong with it, just that it isn't something that is "trusted" by the 
keychains that come preloaded with your browser.

It would be better for the base URLs to match.  The R-help address is e.g.

https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help

If BioC linked to https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/bioconductor 
(which works) this particular warning would not appear.  (If I could find 
a webmaster address for BioC I would report it.)

(The certificate is not on Bioconductor nor on R's computers, but an ETHZ. 
There have been suggestions to buy a commercial certificate for use on the 
R project's mailing list and svn servers hosted by ETHZ, but AFAIK they 
have all fizzled out.)

You don't. This just means that the security certificate for the website

https://www.stat.math.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/bioconductor

hasn't been registered with e.g., VeriSign, so there is no outside 
authority vouching for the security of the site.

If you were going to a commercial site and planning on giving them your 
credit card information this might be something to worry about. However, 
I think the likelihood of someone wanting to spoof the Bioconductor 
listserv archives is relatively low, so I think you are safe ignoring it.

Best,

Jim

It is true as James MacDonald indicated that a spoof of Bio is unlikely so I
have been just ignoring the warning

And there are other work arounds, like telling computer to "always trust" or
grabbing the offered certificate and installing it in the keychain

On the other hand, ignoring security warnings is generally not a good idea
and if the fix is easy, why not fix it and avoid the work arounds

And then a security certificate that everyone ignores is not "security"

The certificate indicates email address is webmaster at math.ethz.ch so I
included same in thread

Hi,

I tried the new gfortran-42.pkg and gcc42build5531.pkg hosted at

I had previously used a gfortran built from FSF sources using the gcc-

this isn't the appropriate place to file a bug report /  
troubleshooting request against those compilers.  Best,

which comes from the "official" tools that don't support Fortran. For  
your particular setup this should be easily fixable by using cc1 from  
the build that included Fortran support:
http://r.research.att.com/cc1-gcc42fort5531-darwin9.tar.gz
but in general this poses a problem, because Apple's version of cc1  
doesn't know about the Fortran front-end (and I don't feel like  
messing with their binaries). Given that I'm using Apple's sources, it  
should be fine for now, but you never know.

Thanks for raising the issue.
Simon

Hi Simon,

Thanks for the link; those copies of cc1 do seem to work fine with "- 
fno-automatic".  I don't know why gfortran invokes them, either --  
perhaps something to do with the preprocessor?  Here's hoping Fortran  
support from Apple becomes a reality sooner rather than later.  Until  
then, thanks for all the work you've done to provide these compilers.   
Regards,

Adam

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] RQuartz copy bug?
Message-ID: <1C81502E-5C46-4FF3-B086-BE5FF98DD729@mac.com>

Hi,

I often copy plots from quartz() windows using cmd-C to paste in other  
apps. Since upgrading to Leopard, when I do so the window becomes  
blank (a grey colour). Resizing the window will force it to redraw.  
Does anyone else see the same problem?

Cheers,

Demitri

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] os x crash using rpanel and tcltk
Message-ID: <debf56250711281443h1810e114gb1a7f3c3ab7bc17b@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
I've recently discovered a persistent issue with rpanel when running
R.app (2.6.1) on Mac OS X 10.4.11. tcltk and rpanel load without any
apparent error, and the interactive panels appear to work as expected,
however upon closing the panels rpanel has created I get catastrophic
errors and R crashes completely. For the most part R manages to crash
with dignity and work can be saved, but sometimes it will crash
straight out. Below is an example of an entire work session (only base
packages loaded) with the crash at the end typical of those
encountered:

> library(tcltk)
Loading Tcl/Tk interface ... done
> library(rpanel)
Package `rpanel', version 1.0-4
type help(rpanel) for summary information
> density.draw <- function(panel) {
+   plot(density(panel$x, bw = panel$h))
+   panel
+ }
> panel <- rp.control(x = rnorm(50))
> rp.slider(panel, h, 0.5, 5, log = TRUE, action = density.draw)

 *** caught bus error ***
address 0x0, cause 'non-existent physical address'

Possible actions:
1: abort (with core dump, if enabled)
2: normal R exit
3: exit R without saving workspace
4: exit R saving workspace

All packages that are required are up to date, and I can find no
evidence of similar issues from searching the mailing lists. Any
suggestions would be appreciated.

Aaron
