After configuring R-1.7.1, I get the message:

configure: WARNING: you cannot build PDF versions of the R manuals

Any clue as to how I can fix this? Thanks.

You need pdftex.  I use the teTeX distribution, and TeXShop
 http://www.uoregon.edu/~koch/texshop/texshop.html
though if you only use it for R documentation there may be simpler ways

I've recently had the 'opportunity' (if you can call a dead hard drive 
that) to rebuild my iBook from scratch and I thought I'd share my 
'building R with minimum changes' :-)

Note: I use bash not tcsh, I don't remember if this syntax works

FPICFLAGS=-fno-common LDFLAGS=-lcc_dynamic ./configure --enable-R-shlib 
--with-aqua --without-x --with-blas='-framework vecLib' --with-lapack
make CFLAGS+=-D__DEBUGGING__

This gets rid of the devQuartz.c building problems caused by 
Debugging.h and gets configure to run. Everything else is according to 
Stefano's website. Obviously you'd need to make modifications for 
Tcl/Tk and recommended packages and such, but this gets me up and 
running without having to modify files (which is good for those of us 
syncing from R-sync :-))

Thanks Byron, I assume you use new Devel Tool updates and nothing from 
fink?
Can other people with new dev tools check this (for example Jan?)
It would be nice to update the instuction page (and R-admin in the 
future)

some general notes:
1. there is no need to configure with --without-x as X11 can now be 
used from inside RAqua
2. please use R-devel and not R-Sig-Mac as we will soon close this list 
(from R-1.8.0)
3. me and Thomas have implemented many new code to the Aqua GUI. If you 
rsync today and reinstall RAqua you'll see these changes
4. tcltk seems to work again but only after launching tkStartGUI()

Yes, gcc-3.3 (and the matching g77-3.3) and local builds of everything 
(well, almost I'm pretty sure my jpeglib and pnglib came from my TeX 
installation).

Also, upon reflection its probably better to change CPPFLAGS to 
'-I/usr/local/include -D__DEBUGGING__' rather than CFLAGS since 
CPPFLAGS is included in the .c.d rule and CFLAGS is not. I must have 
already had the .d files sitting around.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] RAqua for Panther
Message-ID: <CC00F30A-D2A7-11D7-B428-000393BB6D36@stat.ucla.edu>

Building RAqua on Panther is a bit of a hassle, because of (minor)  
problems
with Aqua Tcl/Tk and with g77.  I have put a version in

http://gifi.stat.ucla.edu/pub

which uses no libraries from fink, but it uses Jeff Whittaker's fink
version of g77-3.3 and gas, and not Gaurav Khanna's g77-3.3
with the system gas. By adding some flags to the environment,
I also build the tcltk extensions (but you still have to use
Tcl/Tk through tkStartGUI() -- see Stefano's website). This version
can also use x11 devices (if the X server is running) and has
the new version of the quartz device

Put StartR in /Applications -- and not in any other place. If you
have a problem, I'll try to help, provided you tell me what
Console.app says about your problem.

Both the command line version and the Aqua version build/install
fine on Panther B44. "Make check"runs fine as well.

The configure flags are

configure --enable-R-shlib  
--with-tcl-config=/Library/Frameworks/Tcl.framework/tclConfig.sh  
--with-tk-config=/Library/Frameworks/Tk.framework/tkConfig.sh
	--with-blas='-framework vecLib' --with-lapack --with-aqua

In the environment I have

FPICFLAGS=-fno-common
LDFLAGS=-lcc_dynamic
CPPFLAGS=-D__DEBUGGING__
TCLTK_LIBS=-framework Tcl -framework Tk
TCLTK_CPPFLAGS=-I/Library/Frameworks/Tcl.framework/Versions/Current/ 
Headers -I/Library/Frameworks/Tk.framework/Versions/Current/Headers

I know that the two TCLTK variables (strangely enough), the DEBUGGING  
variable and the FPICFLAGS are necessary.

I am using the g77-3.3 from fink -- not the one from Gaurav Khanna, the  
fink one
comes with a patched assembler.
