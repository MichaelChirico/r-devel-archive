Hi,

loading the tkrplot package (version 0.0-23) causes a segfault. This only seems to happen on Mavericks, not Snow Leopard, Linux, or Windows. 

> library(tkrplot)
Loading required package: tcltk

 *** caught segfault ***
address 0x998, cause 'memory not mapped'

Traceback:
 1: structure(.External(.C_dotTclObjv, objv), class = "tclObj")

Possible actions:
1: abort (with core dump, if enabled)
2: normal R exit
3: exit R without saving workspace
4: exit R saving workspace

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] what's the best way to search this list?
Message-ID: <CALWUdRmFgMBOhXxbjg=Mm7TxFFrbPxLRJw7iTX7fZfbSo=cqNw@mail.gmail.com>

I have a potentially stupid question.  Before I ask it I'd like to see if
it has been answered on this list before, so I'm about to ask a potentially
even stupider question.

I can't see a way to search this list other than
1) browsing the archives day by day at
https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-mac/
2) searching Google and hoping this list pops up.

Is there a search box somewhere that I'm missing?
Thanks. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7WeZbRbxwg&feature=youtu.be&t=28s)

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] parallel R versions
Message-ID: <55A37C86.4000302@echoffmann.ch>

How can I install and use parallel R versions? In the install process, 
there is step 2 where I can see the suggestion of executing

pkgutil --forget org.r-project.R.x86_64.fw.pkg

Question: When, and in which directory, has this to be done? At all, if 
I want multiple versions (release and patched)

The paragraph
4.3 Multiple versions
is not clear enough for me

TIA  C.

Reinstalling XQuartz (and rebooting) had no effect. Any other ideas?

I don't have an answer, but there were a bunch of tk-functions that were removed in version 3.0.0, including: tkcmd(), tkfile.dir(), tkfile.tail(), tkopen(),tkputs(), tkread()

There was also a news() item that specifically mentioned tkrplot and changes to the Windows graphics devices but didn't appear to me to imply anychanges to tkrplot.

Something very similar was reported 

	From: 	Natalija Keck <Natalija.Keck at the-klu.org>
	Subject: 	[R-SIG-Mac] loading issue with tkrplot on OS X Yosemite
	Date: 	May 4, 2015 5:22:37 AM PDT
	To: 	r-sig-mac R <r-sig-mac at r-project.org>

I don't see a response in my local email "not-an-Archive".

I get the same result after installing tkrplot 0.0-23 from CRAN (using the binary pkg and installing with the R.app Package Instller)  and running R from a terminal session. XQuartz loads and then the seg-fault dialog appears. I've got XQuartz 2.7.7 (xorg-server 1.15.2) and the "check for updates" response for a running X11 session says I have the latest version.

For what it's worth, I can reproduce the issue with the binary
provided by CRAN; however, the package successfully loads for me when
installed from source.

    install.packages("tkrplot", type = "source")
    library(tkrplot) ## no segfault

The error seems to occur as a result of loading the `Rplot` symbol(s)
with the following call (this is what the package's `.onLoad()` tries
to do:

    library(tcltk)
    tkrPath <- system.file(package = "tkrplot")
    tkrLib <- file.path(tkrPath, "libs/tkrplot.so")
    tcl("load", tkrLib, "Rplot")

I can't really speculate further as to what the cause of the error is
-- perhaps `tkrplot`, or some other libraries used, were built with
incompatible compilers?

I believe the tcltk package fails to load. I also re installed XQuartz. Was anyone able to install it?

I suspect that you have not obtained Xcode and installed Command line tools and perhaps not installed XQuartz (although that is not the cause of any error that I see here.)

Apple has pretty much always made XCode available for free. You need to register with Apple as a developer and then get the XCode version that is mated to your version of OSX.

There error here is, as it says:

> make: gfortran-4.8: No such file or directory

In other words, `make` is attempting to call `gfortran-4.8` to compile
FORTRAN code in your package, but is unable to find it -- likely
because it's not installed.

Since 'gfortran' is no longer distributed as part of Apple's command
line tools, you'll need to install it from another source -- Simon
Urbanek hosts a version of 'gfortran' at http://r.research.att.com/
(more specifically, in the `libs` directory at
http://r.research.att.com/libs/gfortran-4.8.2-darwin13.tar.bz2).
You'll want to unpack it in the root folder at `/` (or move it there
after unpacking); the directory structure is such that the necessary
pieces are dumped into `/usr/local/` and R will by default be able to
discover everything needed.

Alternatively (if you're prepared to do a bit more work), you can use
the OS X package manager homebrew to install 'gcc' and hence
'gfortran'. Install homebrew following the instructions here:

    http://brew.sh/

and then, from the command line, call

    brew install gcc

This will install an up-to-date version of both 'gcc' and 'gfortran'.
Since it won't be installed into a directory that's 'visible' to R by
default, you'll need to tell R how to find it -- you can check the
StackOverflow questions + responses here for ideas on how to
accomplish that.

    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29992066/rcpp-warning-directory-not-found-for-option-l-usr-local-cellar-gfortran-4-8
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19920281/rcpparmadillo-compile-errors-on-os-x-mavericks/19920761#19920761

As an aside -- I am not sure why make is attempting to call
`gfortran-4.8` rather than `gfortran`. You might have to check
`~/.R/Makevars` or other package configuration variables. (Do you
_really_ need to be compiling with `gfortran-4.8` specifically?)

Hope this helps,
Kevin

gfortran-4.8 is being called because that?s the Fortran compiler in building the R package for Mavericks and higher.
It?s specified  in  the file /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.2/Resources/etc/Makeconf

I use this alternative exclusively, also for installing R and all
dependencies (effectively everything from the "Linux world") and I don't
think it is more work - on contrary - I think if=t is actually easier
and more transparent - but this might be because I come from the Linux
sphere of things and still think Linux - not OSX.

So in a nutshell, if you are used to Linux package managers, I would
recommend to use homebrew. If not, give it a try.

Cheers,

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] several parallel R versions, pkgutil --
Message-ID: <55B7748C.9000507@echoffmann.ch>

How can I install and use parallel R versions? In the install process, 
there is step 2 where I can see the suggestion of executing

pkgutil --forget org.r-project.R.x86_64.fw.pkg

which I execute in the terminal literally.

But this procedure does not prevent the new version from eliminating the 
old version.

What am I missing?
TIA  C.

Hi,

First, thank you for your answers, and I have to admit that don't prepare
to do a bit more work, because I'm a user that I have no programming
skills, and therefore, I depend on people like you, to use these programs.

According to the easier instruction, and I downloaded
gfortran-4.8.2-darwin13.tar.bz2

You'll want to unpack it in the root folder at `/` (or move it there after
unpacking); the directory structure is such that the necessary
pieces are dumped into `/usr/local/` and R will by default be able to discover
everything needed.

It will not let me move the item "usr" to the root folder "/"

Now I have this error message,

> install.packages("~/Desktop/RMacoqui_1.0.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type =
"source",
lib="/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.2/Resources/library")

Many thanks again,

It looks like 'gfortran' was successfully unpacked (since R is
locating it), but I guess it's 'too old' and doesn't work on Yosemite.
The error printed is basically 'gfortran' saying, "I don't understand
the kernel associated with this operating system", likely because it's
too new -- and I guess that's causing the compiler errors.

You'll have to obtain a more up-to-date version of 'gfortran' -- I
would recommend following the earlier instructions posted in this
thread. (I promise that homebrew is relatively painless to install and
use, although there is a bit more setup required that I alluded to in
my earlier post)

As a parting note, after installing 'gfortran', the easiest way to
make R 'aware' of the new compiler is to create a file at the location
`~/.R/Makevars`. Roughly speaking, this file can be used to set what
compilers and compiler flags are used when compiling code from R. Note
that you'll have to create it if it doesn't exist. Within that file,
you should be able to use something like:

    FF=gfortran
    FLIBS=`gfortran -print-search-dirs | grep ^libraries: | sed
's|libraries: =||' | sed 's|:| -L|g' | sed 's|^|-L|'`

Of course, another alternative is to contact the authors of RMacoqui
and ask them to make a binary version of the package available to you,
so you don't need to mess with compilers...

Good luck,
Kevin

It is not  an error message, it?s a warning. Harmless; at least it doesn?t harm me.

I am using gfortran 4.8 (from r.research.att.com) without any problems on OS X Yosemite 10.10.4.

Did you use sudo as in

sudo tar fvxz gfortran-4.8.2-darwin13.tar.bz2  -C /

which worked for me. Do not unpack it somewhere else and then try moving usr to / .
Use the command above.

Jose,

I suspect you're using a rather old Mac that is no longer supported by our tools.

The only other alternative I can think of is that you may have better luck trying to use the older Fortran compiler from CRAN at
https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools/gfortran-4.2.3.pkg

In order to avoid clashes with the newer compiler, you may need to run (on the command line) something like

sudo ln -sfn gfortran /usr/local/bin/gfortran-4.8

I'm not sure if it will work, but that's the best guess short of installing the Homebrew toolchain and re-compiling R which is a bit of an overkill.

Cheers,
Simon

If you can run Yosemite and install Xcode 6, are there further dependencies?

https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/mac/releasenotes/General/rn-osx-10.11/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40016209

That page lists:

Developer Beta System Requirements

The OS X El Capitan Developer Beta supports the following Macs:

	? iMac (Mid 2007 or newer)

	? MacBook Air (Late 2008 or newer)

	? MacBook (Late 2008 Aluminum, or Early 2009 or newer)

	? Mac mini (Early 2009 or newer)

	? MacBook Pro (Mid/Late 2007 or newer)

	? Mac Pro (Early 2008 or newer)

	? Xserve (Early 2009)

This is essentially the same set of machines that can run Yosemite.

Well I can see one problem. The default for package type is mac.binary. When I do this on an earlier version of OSX I get a report of successful installation:

 install.packages("RMacoqui", repos="http://R-Forge.R-project.org", type="source", dependencies=TRUE)

I'm not sure if this is helpful, but I'm running 10.10.4 and had no issues
installing from the source as David posted.

 (last revision July-2015)

RMacoqui develops a probability procedure for the identification of
chorotypes,
i.e. distribution patterns shared by a group of species, which can be
operatively
identified within an area (Baroni-Urbani et al., 1978).
This method was first published by Marquez et al. (1997),
based on  a prior proposal for detecting biogeographic boundaries (Real et
al., 1992),
and with a mathematic rationale derived from McCoy et al. (1986).
The method for chorotype identification was later enhanced by Munoz et al.
(2003)
and Real et al. (2008), and was updated and contextualized under a fuzzy
logic framework
by Olivero et al. (2011).
RMacoqui outputs  are also useful as the basis for delimiting biogeographic
regions
and transition zones with the support of the fuzzy logic (Olivero et al.
2013).

If that machine has an Intel Core 2 Duo processor and not an i3,i5, or i7 processor you can?t use gfortran 4.8.2.
You?ll have  to use the Snow Leopard version of R and the older gfortran (gfortran 4.2.3)

Is it possible to have both versions of R installed on the same machine,
Snow Leopard and Maverick?

It?s not just old Macs: I see the same warning on a late-2013 MacBook Pro (so the second-latest generation):

$ gfortran --version
gfortran: warning: couldn?t understand kern.osversion ?14.4.0
GNU Fortran (GCC) 4.8.2

The warning is gfortran-4.8 and OS X Yosemite specific; AFAIK it has nothing to do with the specific processor.

Only the ?illegal instruction? and ?abort trap? messages are  Intel Core 2 Duo related.

This happened for me too: that Intel Core 2 is just too old for the compiler.

I used it as a stimulus to buy a new laptop? As a bonus, everything is ~10x faster

Hum, well, I wasn't actually planning to switch out my MB Air just now.

I'm actually baffled that I haven't bumped into this before. Both my laptop and my office desktop are Core 2 Duo machines (and the latter is the one that builds the R source releases!).

Anyone have some harder info on this? Is it the case that gfortran-4.8 cannot compile code for the C2D architecture, or is it just that the compiler binaries on Simon's site were built for later architectures and are not backwards compatible. The latter could be fixed by rebuilding the compiler.

Hi,

In these r-forge projects,
https://r-forge.r-project.org/R/?group_id=1853
https://r-forge.r-project.org/R/?group_id=1876
http://r-forge.r-project.org/R/?group_id=1875

All these packages run in my old Core 2 Duo machine, OS X Yosemite and R
version updated.

In the case of package RMacoqui was created and compiled first on Windows.

Best regards,

If you use gfortran: which version?
If you are not using any floating point then gfortran-4.8 will probably work without problems.
I think.

As far I know the compiler binaries use/generate floating point instructions directly or indirectly that cannot be handled by a C2D.
See this reply by Simon to my original post:  https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-mac/2014-May/010895.html
Probably more than just the compiler binaries would have to be recompiled.

It's 4.2.1 and 4.2.3, it seems. That's for the local builds; for the CRAN binaries, it seems that I just never tried building a package with Fortran in it. Not sure whether I have used any Fortran binaries (is there an easy way to check whether a package contains Fortran?) 

>> Anyone have some harder info on this? Is it the case that gfortran-4.8 cannot compile code for the C2D architecture, or is it just that the compiler binaries on Simon's site were built for later architectures and are not backwards compatible. The latter could be fixed by rebuilding the compiler.

Yes, but "use/generate" is exactly the question. As far as I can tell, the invalid instruction is from f951 itself rather than the code that it generates.

Peter,

The first one that comes to mind is Frank?s rms, if that helps.

Regards,

Marc

Is it the case that gfortran-4.8 cannot compile code for the C2D architecture, or is it just that the compiler binaries on Simon's site were built for later architectures and are not backwards compatible. The latter could be fixed by rebuilding the compiler.

Hmm, the binaries install, load, and the first handfull of example()s run OK.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] segfault 'memory not mapped'
Message-ID: <F8816B12-51D7-4EB1-9DCA-980AD6D5F2EB@cam.ac.uk>


I have a new Macbook Pro laptop running OS10.10.3 and have just installed the latest version of R (v.3.2.1) on it.  Now whenever I use fix() and close the data frame R crashes:

[R.app GUI 1.66 (6956) x86_64-apple-darwin13.4.0]

[History restored from /Users/SamCox/.Rapp.history]

> test<-data.frame(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)
> fix(test)

 *** caught segfault ***
address 0x7fff00010bb0, cause 'memory not mapped'

Possible actions:
1: abort (with core dump, if enabled)
2: normal R exit
3: exit R without saving workspace
4: exit R saving workspace
> 
Selection: 

This happens no matter whether I import my own data or create new data within R.  A response on StackOverflow to someone having the same issue suggested that they post to this group, but I did not see a relevant post in the thread history.  I have uninstalled and redownloaded and reinstalled but to no avail.  I am not sure what other information to give, as I am still relatively new to the software, but I have used R on a older laptop for the past year with no issues and I?m not sure if this is a problem with R, OS X Yosemite, or just my computer.  Any information or advice you could give would be welcome.  

Best, 
Sam
