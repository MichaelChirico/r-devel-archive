Dear Mac users of R and developers.


I recently updated to the Sonoma OS for Mac  (14.0)  and it has a serious problem for graphics.

plot(1:10) creates a graphic window but I can not switch back to the console window using either command-1 or the mouse.

Anybody else having this problem?  Any suggestions for a patch?

I am running a MacBook Pro with M1 Max.

Bill

Yes, I've got the same issue. It's a deal breaker and has been there the
whole beta of os14

There are some other new deprecated and end of life code calls that need
cleaning up too.

Rodney,

Thanks for your quick reply.

It turns out this is just a problem with the base R  for Mac graphics window (which is to say, the version I like).  I can still use R-studio (which I don?t like as much).  

I can wait patiently for a patch to the Mac version while using R-Studio.

That way I don?t have to go through the hassle of trying to reinstall 13.x and dumping 14.0.

Bill

Desmond,

thanks for the report. There seem to be windows focus issue in Sonoma so I would not recommend upgrading at this point. Hopefully this will be fixed in a future macOS update (the .0 versions are notoriously flaky) - in the meantime I'll see if there is any work-around we could do in R.

Cheers,
Simon

Thanks so much for the information, Simon! Glad to know it is just not me?

It was indeed ill-advised of me to upgrade the Operating System so soon. But, by bitter experience do we near ever closer to saintliness?

Thanks very much, again!

Cheers,

Des

Neither of you have mentioned anything about the need for reinstallation of Xquartz. Was that done?

I did not need to do so when updating to Sonoma.  And of course the 
E.app console (not 'base R') which seems to be the issue does not use X11.

I also did not need to reinstall CLT on this occasion.

The main issue I have found with Sonoma is that it has changed to a 
different (apparently FreeBSD-derived) implementation of iconv with 
(deliberate but undocumented in the release notes) changes in behaviour 
yet still reporting itself as 'libiconv 1.11' using a call specific to 
GNU libiconv).  We have started added workarounds to R-devel and R-patched.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] How can I stop my R console and other R windows
 "flickering" after I updated my Mac OS to Sonoma 14.0?

I have the same problem in R app, but not in R studio, so there is a simple workaround at this stage. Others have reported the same (problem and R studio working ok).

Dear All,

I updated my Apple Silicon M1 Pro MacBook from Ventura to Sonoma 14.0. I have the latest version of R for Apple Silicon (4.3.1, "Beagle Scouts"). I also have the latest version of XQuartz (2.8.5).

On Ventura, my R setup worked fine ("classic" R.app GUI using console and script windows, not Rstudio or terminal). However, with Sonoma, when I try and toggle between the R console and an R script, the windows transition at very high speed between each other, making it nearly impossible to select either the console or the script.

This "flickering" phenomenon lasts for ~ 10-15 seconds each time I change windows between console and script, making the software nearly unusable. Changing the screen refresh rate does not help.

The problem is specific for R.app and does not affect other software.

Any suggestions gratefully received. I have also posted this question to stackoverflow.

Many thanks,

Desmond Smith

It turns out that is not just the graphics window that the focus problem, it is all windows.  That is, opening the help window takes focus away from the console and help needs to be closed before the console window will be active.  The install package window has the same problem.

For each case, closing the extra window restores console functioning.  

I report this just so Simon can see the report.

I remain in awe of the work of Simon in getting the Mac version to work so well.

I am running 

R version 4.3.1 Patched (2023-09-30 r85239)
Platform: aarch64-apple-darwin20 (64-bit)
Running under: macOS Sonoma 14.0

Hello.

I am wondering if this is just an issue on M1/2 chips or does it also affect Intel?

I usually hold off upgrading until the first or second patch, but I feel I should warn students in my class.

I've confirmed it on the M-chip but afraid to test on my Intel.? I have 
had a problem for years now, that seems related and limited to R.app.? 
RStudio does not have the problem: which is why I stopped using R.app.

On multiple machines, all architectures, R.app spontaneously switches 
from editor windows to console and the switching of focus causes code to 
get damaged or destroyed unwittingly.

RStudio has its own problems but this problem has never been solved (for 
me) and I haven't been able to confirm it with others so no known 
cause.? It may be related to this current problem since it seems to be 
in the same general domain.

I can confirm that the behavior is the same on an Intel machine
freshly upgraded to Sonoma with R 4.3.0 R.app GUI 1.79 (8238)
aarch64-apple-darwin20
And it has been going on my M2 MBP R4.3.1 R.app GUI 1.79 (8238)
aarch64-apple-darwin20

Does the team need any debug outputs or similar to understand the
issue? Happy to send what's needed. Please advise.

HTH,
Brandon

I was having problems with Rstudio after upgrading to Sonoma. I removed and
reinstalled R and the problems seem to disappear.

I ran into this problem when trying to open R after upgrading to Sonoma on
an Intel Mac (I don't have this problem on an M1 machine)

I just tried reinstalling R on a M1 with Sonoma but the problem persists.

I was having problems with Rstudio after upgrading to Sonoma. I removed and

I had a look and can reproduce it. What happens is that macOS Sonoma is sending dozens of notifications that a window will close (even if no window is being closed!) and since we move the focus to the next window on close it happens every time macOS sends that notification and thus many times in sequence. Unfortunately it is not clear why Sonoma does it and it makes no sense, so some more digging will be required. I have added a quick hack to simply not change focus on close - it is not ideal as it doesn't address the (unknown) cause which may have many more repercussions, but it lets you try it out (R 4.3.x and arm64 only):

https://mac.R-project.org/test/Mac-GUI-R-4.3-arm64.dmg

Do not use that build on other macOS systems that don't exhibit the bug. There are still more known issues with Sonoma (e.g., you cannot close an R document without saving), so avoid upgrading until it stabilizes more. In the meantime I'll see if I can find out more about the mysterious bugs in Sonoma.

Cheers,
Simon

It is an issue with Sonoma macOS new TUI classes and not the architecture so it will affect both.

Definitely - I always tell them not to upgrade right away as major macOS versions are notoriously buggy. Ideally, you shouldn't upgrade until next R patch release since if macOS breaks something we can't fix (officially) it until the next release.

Not to beat a dead horse, but it may be that this is the mechanism for 
the spontaneous switching I was experiencing in versions for a couple of 
years.? Don't know why I would be unique in that but it seems to have 
been the case.

Just adding the observation in case it provides a puzzle piece.? The 
underlying problem could go back a while (or not).

Hi John,

You are not unique in noticing the apparently random (single) switching of R.app windows in previous versions of Mac OS X (Ventura).

I observed the same phenomenon, but simply lived with it, despite some close calls in code destruction? I had to keep my wits about me!

Cheers,

Des

I updated to Sonoma. I reinstalled R and RStudio and is working fine for me
in M1 and Intel.

?R.app? can?t be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software.

I can circumvent it but I thought it was pretty funny.

I had a look and can reproduce it. What happens is that macOS Sonoma is sending dozens of notifications that a window will close (even if no window is being closed!) and since we move the focus to the next window on close it happens every time macOS sends that notification and thus many times in sequence. Unfortunately it is not clear why Sonoma does it and it makes no sense, so some more digging will be required. I have added a quick hack to simply not change focus on close - it is not ideal as it doesn't address the (unknown) cause which may have many more repercussions, but it lets you try it out (R 4.3.x and arm64 only):

Do not use that build on other macOS systems that don't exhibit the bug. There are still more known issues with Sonoma (e.g., you cannot close an R document without saving), so avoid upgrading until it stabilizes more. In the meantime I'll see if I can find out more about the mysterious bugs in Sonoma.

Cheers,
Simon

Federico,

yes, you can right-click and select Open. The app is signed, but is it not notarized - we only do that for the R release packages, because that's how our process works.

Cheers,
Simon

This build of R.GUI works fine on my MacBook Pro M2 with Sonoma. The previous version of R.GUI did not work well (same problems as the other emails indicated).

Best regards.

What happens is that macOS Sonoma is sending dozens of notifications that a window will close (even if no window is being closed!) and since we move the focus to the next window on close it happens every time macOS sends that notification and thus many times in sequence. Unfortunately it is not clear why Sonoma does it and it makes no sense, so some more digging will be required. I have added a quick hack to simply not change focus on close - it is not ideal as it doesn't address the (unknown) cause which may have many more repercussions, but it lets you try it out (R 4.3.x and arm64 only):

There are still more known issues with Sonoma (e.g., you cannot close an R document without saving), so avoid upgrading until it stabilizes more. In the meantime I'll see if I can find out more about the mysterious bugs in Sonoma.
