Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] RExecServer repository and a few other notes
Message-ID: <7098abec0707012307s2f54ef98uf7d16f313c8520d3@mail.gmail.com>

I've created a public git repository for RExecServer at
http://repo.or.cz/w/RExecServer.git for people interested in compiling
their own or checking out the source code. Interestingly enough, the
same site also seems to be hosting CommonLispStat (though the
repository is empty). :-)

This weekend, I fixed a few things to do with paging and some minor
graphics issues, mostly concerning clipping rectangles (the last page
of the lattice demo now renders properly), as well as gave back
command line options (except --gui and -g of course) and set up a
workaround for the (harmless) warning about ServiceProviders.

I'd like to do a couple more things before rolling another
binary---help files still don't work and I'd like to get bitmap/pdf
output running (it'll go something like quartz("jpeg:MyBitmap.jpg") to
get it to work). Then I think most of the work will go towards the
distributed object implementation for a time.

To avoid spamming the list too much, I'll be putting most notes about
progress up on http://statcomp.blogspot.com. I figure most people know
how RSS feeds and such work these days (alternatively you can also
subscribe to the commit feed, but the former will probably have more
detail and less granularity).

To those who sent feedback, thanks for the responses so far.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Problem with library(CarbonEL) in .Rprofile
Message-ID: <m2hconrwub.fsf@gmail.com>


[I asked on r-help, but got no reply, so I am trying again here,
probably this list is more appropriate]

Hello,

I am a Mac user and prefer the quartz device. So far, I have always
typed the following in manually after starting R via ESS:

library(CarbonEL)
options(device="quartz")

That works without problems, and allows me to use the quartz device
instead of X11.

I put this into my .Rprofile, thinking that this way I don't have to
type this every time I start R. Once I do this (there is nothing else
in the .Rprofile), I get the following error, though:

Error in dyn.load(x, as.logical(local), as.logical(now)) : 
	unable to load shared library '/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/library/CarbonEL/libs/ppc/CarbonEL.so':
  dlopen(/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/library/CarbonEL/libs/ppc/CarbonEL.so, 6): Symbol not found: _TransformProcessType
  Referenced from: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/library/CarbonEL/libs/ppc/CarbonEL.so
  Expected in: flat namespace
Error in library(CarbonEL) : .First.lib failed for 'CarbonEL'

What do I need to do to get this to work?

Thanks.

Max

Yes, that's a much better idea ;).

Add
library(graphics)
*before* library(CarbonEL).

Hi all,

Thanks for the help. Disabling syntax highlighting does the trick.
Just a note: long scripts and long for loops cannot, or at least
should not, always be avoided. Thanks!

Matt

Hi, there:

I am re-compiling Package supclust for some small modification for my
own purpose. After running "R CMD check", I got the following
messenge:

nicebaby:~/Documents/projects/R_customerized_packages wshi$ R CMD check supclust
* checking for working latex ...sh: line 1: latex: command not found
 NO
* using log directory
'/Users/wshi/Documents/projects/R_customerized_packages/supclust.Rcheck'
* using R version 2.5.0 (2007-04-23)
* checking for file 'supclust/DESCRIPTION' ... OK
* this is package 'supclust' version '1.0-5'
* checking package dependencies ... OK
* checking if this is a source package ... WARNING
Subdirectory 'supclust/src' contains object files.
* checking whether package 'supclust' can be installed ... ERROR
Installation failed.
See '/Users/wshi/Documents/projects/R_customerized_packages/supclust.Rcheck/00install.out'
for details.

The first one is about latex, I am going to install from office
tomorrow since my home internet is really slow to download that one;

The second is a warning about the source, and I am not sure how to
find the detailed warning messege;

The third one is the most serious one; check the detail and I found I
did not have
libgfortran.dylib and libgcc_s.10.4.dylib;
so I installed gfortran 4.2, as shown below:
nicebaby:~/Documents/projects/R_customerized_packages wshi$ gfortran --version
GNU Fortran (GCC) 4.2.0
Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

GNU Fortran comes with NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.
You may redistribute copies of GNU Fortran
under the terms of the GNU General Public License.
For more information about these matters, see the file named COPYING

But splotlight still does not help me find the two files above;

So my third quesiton actually is, how to solve the problem. (For the
same slow internet reason, my xcode tool is still at 2.2.0 version.
But I assume it is not related since 2.4.0 might not include gfortran
either.

My mac os/x is 10.4.9

Please help!

Thanks,

Weiwei

How did you get gfortran? You should get the version form Simon's  
website or the one from the CRAN binary.

You will need Xcode 2.4.x because of the updates to the C compiler

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] error compiling rgdal on mac os x
Message-ID: <468B3BFA.8030407@lilik.it>

I'm trying to compile the rgdal package on a MacOSX 10.4.10 with Xcode 
Tools 2.4.1. I have already installed the PROJ.4 and GEOS library 
together with GRASS. I installed a newer version of the GDAL library 
(1.4.1) from source. I try compiling rgdal with the following command

sudo R CMD INSTALL --configure-args='--bindir=/opt/local/bin 
--with-gdal-config=/usr/local/bin/gdal-config 
--with-proj-include=/usr/local/grasslib/include 
--with-proj-lib=/usr/local/grasslib/lib' rgdal_0.5-13.tar.gz

but it fails compiling..

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] History problems with R.app GUI 1.20
Message-ID: <78387451-4E6E-443C-BAD9-B6B3C7A1E75F@hiit.fi>

Hi!

In short, I am experiencing the same problems as this poster:

https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help/2006-March/102264.html

I am using R 2.5.1 GUI 1.20 (4535) installed from a binary under OS X  
10.4.10.

More verbosely:

I installed R 2.5.0 on this machine two weeks ago, played around with  
it a little, and installed packages tm and Rstem. I also  
unsuccessfully attempted to install ttda. Today I returned to R with  
the intention of continuing from where I left off. Workspace objects  
were there, but the command history only contained a couple of dozen  
entries from my first session, the last entry being "library 
(ttda)" (after which I probably quit that particular session). I  
noted that new commands were being added to the history drawer, but  
not written to .Rhistory upon exit. However, .Rhistory was touched  
every time (timestamp updated).

I proceeded to uninstall R 2.5.0 by removing /Applications/R.app, / 
Library/Frameworks/R.framework, ~/.RData, ~/.Rhistory and ~/Library/ 
Preferences/org.R-project.R.plist. I then installed R 2.5.1 without  
the additional packages, but the same problem persisted. I  
experimented with the "Save History" and "Load History" buttons with  
the same results as the poster referenced above. The history files  
produced this way look like this:

$ cat h.history
ls()#

summary(x)#

rm(x)#

$

I then uninstalled, rebooted, re-installed again, and ran a short  
session. This time, the session history was saved successfully upon  
exit. However, in subsequent sessions the problem reappeared. I tried  
deleting org.R-project.R.plist but this had no effect.

The text based interface invoked from Terminal seems to work properly  
and the GUI successfully loads the history produced by the text based  
interface.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

Hi,

I often get 2 strange lines above or below the welcome message since  
updating from 2.5 to 2.5.1. This happens when I start, using R.app.  
Here is the case from this morning:

Twice I got two lines when starting up. The second time they were at  
the beginning:

Should I be worried? I quit R and started it again right away and the  
two lines did not show up.

Vili,

What are your preference settings for history (Startup preferences)  
under R.app?
By selecting the 'cleanup history entries' the extra lines should  
disappear.

R.app history is kind of a superset R history in that it does handle  
multiple line
history, but unfortunately that means you cannot easily go back from  
R.app
to R (the other way should be no problem).

Regards,
Rob

This worked, thank you. The trick was to check this option and  
restart R.app before even attempting to save a history file. This  
option had become unchecked while I was trying to find ways to make  
the autosave work properly.

So after this, I was able to save and load history files through the  
GUI without any problems coming up at least during my tests. However,  
the automatic loading of history upon exit was still broken: mostly  
not working at all, but a couple of times during my tests actually  
saving it, once in the corrupted format (with #'s).

I then received further advice from Rob:

After I renamed the history file, the autosave/load seemed to start  
working flawlessly as well. All my problems are thus fixed. Thank you!

By the way: since upgrading from 2.5.0 to 2.5.1 I started getting the  
message pasted below in red letters on the editor screen upon  
startup, either before or after the R splash text. Sometimes it does  
not appear at all. Nothing seems broken so far, but I thought I would  
mention it.

I have seen this also.

Yesterday I upgraded R from  2.5.0 to 2.5.1 on an 
Intel MacBook Pro running 10.4.10.

The first time I started R 2.5.1 using R.app, the message appeared once.
I immediately quit R, then started it again. The message appeared twice, as
in Denis' email below. I quit R, started it again. No message.

After rereading my message I saw it was poorly worded. But Don  
deciphered it correctly!

I have now used R 2.5.1 four times and I got those lines only the  
first 2 times. The first time, the two weird lines were after the  
welcome message. I did not restart because I only needed R for a  
couple of minutes: it appeared to function normally despite these  
lines. This morning I launched R again, got the 2 lines before  
instead of after the welcome message. I quit R and restarted, no  
weird line.

After a few hours, I needed R again, no weird line. Maybe they are  
gone for good ;-)

Unfortunately I cannot reproduce on my PB G4 (which is all I have for  
now).

Does the error appear when R takes long to start? (e.g. when started  
for the first time). There is a new timeout on R/R.app communication  
(stdout/stderr) to avoid deadlocks and that may be causing it  
(although the timeout itself is being caught).

The message is harmless, because R.app simply re-connects automatically.

I'm currently traveling, but I'll try to fix this once I'm back.

Cheers,
Simon

I did not notice that R took longer than usual to start when I got  
such lines.
But I'm glad to know the message is harmless.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] problems with memory in Mac
Message-ID: <4695F559.1050106@esa.ipvc.pt>

Dear friends,

I am having some doubts about the amount of memory that is being used by 
R in my Mac (MacBook Pro, 2Gig). Is there a way to increase the amount 
of memory used?

When I type:

 > mem.limits()

the result is:

nsize vsize
   NA    NA

and I can't change it, tough my computing in R isn't using all the 
memory at it's disposal.

Best regards,
Carlos

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Strange startup error message...
Message-ID: <46961219.2080001@itu.edu.tr>

Dear all,

I am new to R and I am running it on a MacBook Pro with Mac OS X 10.4.10.
When I start R, I get the following message:

2007-07-12 14:18:14.662 R[1291] *** -[NSBundle load]: Error loading code
/Users/dalfes/Library/InputManagers/iPLM/iPLM.bundle/Contents/MacOS/iPLM
for bundle /Users/dalfes/Library/InputManagers/iPLM/iPLM.bundle, error code
2 (link edit error code 0, error number 0 ())

If I get rit of the /Users/dalfes/Library/InputManagers folder, it stops
giving this error message for a while, then I start getting it again...

Most probably it does not affect the functioning of R, but it might 
indicate some installation probelm...

Does anybody have an idea?

Thanks,

N?zhet Dalfes

<http://www.macfixit.com/article.php?story=20070706084331828>

Here's the text from the above MacFixit article (20070706)
that sums up the problem (and resolution) nicely.


---------Start--------------------------------------------
Crashing (especially Safari)? Remove Input Managers first!

A recent cartoon in The New Yorker shows a doctor telling
his patient: "Sure, it's a routine procedure, if you
routinely have someone slice you open with sharp instruments
and then fiddle with your insides." Pretty funny, eh? Who
would "routinely" permit that? Yet MacFixIt readers do
routinely do something analogous to applications that they
depend on - and then they wonder why those applications
are behaving oddly.

We here at a MacFixIt continue to receive email from people
who are disregarding our advice about Input Managers. How
many times do we have to say it? We've told you in the past
here (for example), and recently here and here. And we have
repeatedly referred to this article, which explains what
Input Managers do. They reach right into an application and
alter its code! This puts the behavior of the affected
application outside the control and responsibility of its
developers.

To permit that kind of thing is to revert to the confusion
of Mac OS 9 and before, with its conflicting INITs and
Extensions that were so difficult to manage and caused all
kinds of incomprehensible crashes. If an application
doesn't have a feature that you want, place a feature
request with the developers, or use a different application.
Don't modify the application behind the developers' back.

At their worst, Input Managers can be a massive and
frightening security hole. Remember, one of these puppies
can make your applications do things they were never intended
to do. That's what the Oompa-Loompa trojan was all about,
remember? The trojan was itself just a proof of concept, and
didn't make your application's misbehave in any drastic way;
but it could have, and that was the point.

Just today we received this email:

  Dear Sirs:

  Safari 2.0.4 freezes on Mac OS X 10.4.10 while surfing
  Internet. Console says:

  2007-07-06 08:07:28.023 Console[1117] *** -[NSBundle load]:
  Errorloading code /Library/InputManagers/Menu Extra Enabler/
  Menu Extra Enabler.bundle/Contents/MacOS/Menu Extra Enabler
  for bundle /Library/InputManagers/Menu Extra Enabler/
  Menu Extra Enabler.bundle, error code 2 (link edit error
  code 0, error number 0 ())

  I am puzzled.

Well, stop being puzzled and try the advice we have given
again and again. Stop using Input Managers. Just stop it!
Locate your InputManagers folders (in your user Library
directory and in the top-level /Library directory), empty
them, and restart the computer. Yes, you'll lose some cute
customization, but you'll gain a computer that operates
with more of the stability and predictability that you
expect from Mac OS X.

Dear all

When running "R CMD check" on my Intel-Mac, I get always the line:
* checking for working latex ...sh: line 1: latex: command not found

So I downloaded the i-Installer II and installed gwTeX as administrator.

As user I put the directory  /usr/texbin  in ".bashrc":
export PATH=usr/texbin:$PATH

When I do "echo $PATH" I get:
/Volumes/CoreData/ROOT/root/bin:usr/texbin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/X11R6/bin

So the correct path to "tex", "latex" and "texi2dvi" is now included.

However, I still get the following output of R CMD check:

you are missing a leading slash before usr/texbin.

You didn't - you have put "usr/texbin" there which doesn't help ...

Why don't you just test it with "latex"? You don't need to run make  
check to test that ;)

Dear Simon

Thank you, too! Sorry, my stupid mistake, and I realized too late that I 
could have typed "latex".

With one package now everything works fine.

In contrast, with my other package I get an error. Looking at the 
log-file I see that
latex does not understand the command:
  \url{http://nnn.com}

Interestingly, the identical Snw-file runs fine on FC4.
Do I have to define \url{} in the Snw-file on the Mac?

Moreover, I get the following output:

Hi

OSX 10.4.10, R2.5.1 (4535)GUI

I have reported this error with [ ] and } a few times.

It arises when the following array of features is side by side: [ ]}  
as if you'd be indexing within a function or a loop.

The error that arises is

2007-07-19 17:35:19.679 R[1520] Exception raised during posting of  
notification.  Ignored.  exception: -[NSLayoutManager  
_fillGlyphHoleAtIndex:desiredNumberOfCharacters:] *** attempted glyph  
generation while textStorage is editing.  It is not valid to cause  
the layoutManager to do glyph generation while the textStorage is  
editing (ie the textStorage has been sent a beginEditing message  
without a matching endEditing.)


It locks the editor from editing, but not from saving.  i.e. you have  
to save and close and re-open.

If you can't replicate, I could try and provide a clearer example  
beyond this.  Try typing in the following and then adding an index []  
after the [,i].  A carriage return after typeing the first {} after  
the for () is necessary.


	for(i in 1:4){
		heterozygosity[,i]}


Cheers

Andrew,

thanks for the report. It should now be fixed in R GUI build 4644  
(binary should be available tomorrow).

Thanks,

That may be an indication that you forgot to use the hyperref package...

Dear Simon

You are right, I missed package hyperref (or url),;when adding this package
the strange output disappeared, too.
(The reason, why I did not catch this error was that with FC4 I got the 
correct
result w/o any error messages, although the Snw-file was identical).

Thank you
Christian

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Installing R under 64-bit architecture
Message-ID: <46A14AEF.1030403@stat.byu.edu>

Hi Everyone,

I'm new to the Mac world, so go easy on me if this is a really dumb 
question!

I'm trying to build R from source (under 64-bit architecture) on my 
64-bit (Intel) Mac with OS X Tiger.

Here's what I've done: I downloaded R-2.5.1.tar.gz (should I be using a 
different version? I'm guessing no) from the r-project webpage, 
unarchived the file, went to into the directory and then followed the 
./configure command as given at http://r.research.att.com/exp/ and it works!

Then when I try to 'make' the program it runs for a while and then gives 
me the following error:

building package 'base'
mkdir ../../../library/base/demo
mkdir ../../../library/base/po
mkdir ../../../library/base/man
Error: C stack usage is too close to the limit
Execution halted
make[3]: *** [all] Error 1
make[2]: *** [R] Error 1
make[1]: *** [R] Error 1
make: *** [R] Error 1

Is this a problem with R, make or with OS X? Does anyone know how I can 
overcome this (and please explain in simple terms how to fix it!)

Thanks,

Evan

Hi,

I am running R 2.5.1 on Mac OS 10.4.10 and fail to build a package manual.
Below is the transcript. The problem is a "pdflatex: command not found"

with iInstaller) as I use TeXShop with no problem.

Could someone help?

I think Brian's point was that you don't have pdflatex in your search  
path.

For example, open the terminal and type:

pdflatex

I'm guessing that you're going to get the same 'command not found'  
error.

You need to identify where your pdflatex is and add it to your PATH  
variable (eg., in your ~/.profile)

The startup error should be gone in the current version.

As of running an external program that takes too long - there is a  
conceptual problem here. The goal of the new timeout (which causes  
those messages) is to prevent lock-ups of the GUI by packages or  
programs that produce too much output before giving R chance to  
display it.

This problem is now fixed. I trashed R.app and re-installed. It now 
works fine.

Hi,

Is there a way to clear the console of all the text that has been 
printed there?  The R implementation for a Windows computer has that 
capability.

Sincerely,

Keith Jones

1) please read the list before posting, the answer is there
2) try a more recent build of R.app (from http://r.research.att.com/ )

there are flags to tell R CMD build/install where to find headers and 
libraries.  you will need them, as your headers and libs are in 
nonstandard locations.  PVM_ROOT is insufficient.

Message-ID: <F0207A51-4A8D-4FEB-8B50-5F7863B16465@psp.ucl.ac.be>

Dear mac useRs,

I  have problems when trying to edit code in the RGUI when the file   
was open by clicking in the finder.
I repeated the same operation a lot of times and obtain two different  
kinds of problems: either the edited file 'freezed' and the R console  
display a error message (see below) or the R GUI crashed (log below).  
Everything was right when I edited the file after opening by Cmd-O in  
the R GUI.

Any help would be helpful

Regards,

Matthieu

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] configure.in on Mac
Message-ID: <46AB3E72.1000100@aon.at>

Dear all

I would like to add to my configure.in file the following commands,
which should only be checked on Mac OS X:

   if test -z "${DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH}"; then
      echo ""
      echo "${R_PACKAGE_NAME} configuration error:"
      echo ""
      exit 1
   fi

However, these commands should only be executed on a Mac.
What do I need to do to be able to test if the configure.in file is 
executed
on a Mac?
I tried to use ${R_ARCH} but this returns an empty string.

Thank you in advance
Best regards
Christian

Thanks, Sture, it should be now fixed in the R GUI revision 4681.

Cheers,

The R-devel image on http://R.research.att.com/ is R-devel-42258.dmg
and is dated July 30 but https://svn.R-project.org/R/trunk is at
r42358.  Has something gone wrong with the update scripts?

R_ARCH has nothing to do with a Mac anyway. Try something like
OS=`uname`
if test "${OS}" = Darwin; then
..
fi

However, I hope you know what you're doing - setting  
DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH is highly dangerous and often breaks the system, so  
the check should be rather the other way round ;). Usually, if you  
require it, then you're doing something wrong.. (or the author of the  
dependent library...).

Cheers,
Simon

Thank you for this tip, this works nicely.

My package (which BTW I have already submitted to BioC) depends on the 
ROOT C++ framework (http://root.cern.ch/), which requires setting 
DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH on Mac. For this reason I want to check if the user 
has set it. (Although using ROOT for many years, I have never 
experienced any problems setting this variable.)

I have actually solved my problem: I had not installed the fortran package 
that comes with the installation of R 2.5.1. Apologies for the 
inconvenience.

Best regards,

Hi, 

I have downloaded R 2.5.1. I have installed the packages "Hmisc" and "its" 
using package installer (install location : at system level and then I also 
did i as defined by .libPaths(); I guess it is the same(?)). Typing 
library() shows that the packages have been installed. I then type 
library(Hmisc) and get the following output:

Error in dyn.load(x, as.logical(local), as.logical(now)) : 
         unable to load shared library 
'/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.5/Resources/library/cluster/libs/i386/cluster.so':
   
dlopen(/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.5/Resources/library/cluster/libs/i386/cluster.so, 
6): Library not loaded: /usr/local/lib/libgfortran.2.dylib
  Referenced from: 
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/2.5/Resources/library/cluster/libs/i386/cluster.so
  Reason: image not found
Error: package/namespace load failed for 'Hmisc'
 
When I type library(its) i get the same output (I guess the problem is 
related to Hmisc)

For the sake of comparison I installed the package boot and loaded it 
without problems.

I am new to Mac (I have tiger version) and R as well, but the problem seems 
with R. I hope you can help me. Best regards, Alessio Sancetta
