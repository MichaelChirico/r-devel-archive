I still have one other question (sorry, it comes late but I was not home):

I intend to install R-patched but since I've never done it, I'm not sure 
which version to install from http://r.research.att.com/
Should it be R-3.1-branch or R-devel?

Thanks again for your help
Ivan


PS: regarding Xcode, I don't have a developer ID (and I don't intend to 
pay for it since I would never use it), so I cannot download Xcode for 
MacOS 10.6

Hi Ivan,

Setting up a developer ID and downloading Xcode should be free unless something recently changed. Give it a try.

Cheers,

R-3.1-branch is current R-patched.

Eh?  You just need to register your Apple ID to use that site.  Paid IDs 
get access to pre-release software, but AFAIK the rest is open to all 
registered users.

Ah ok, I did not understand it that way from the Apple website. Then

Hi Laura,

I solved the problem with either of the two solutions proposed:
1) I first tried the R-3.1-branch and it worked fine, without the need 
for Xcode 4.2
2) I then got the installer for Xcode 4.2 and I tried it with the 
regular R-3.1.2, without problem

I cannot tell you why the first solution did not work for you since it 
did for me. Try again?

HTH,
Ivan

Hi Ivan, 
I have exactly the same problem as you had and I cannot solve it.
I have tried with installing the R-3-1-branch (http://r.research.att.com/) 
and gfortran (http://cran.us.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools/). I have also 
tried to open an account as Mac developers to find the X code 4.2 but it 
was denied. Would you mind to explain me how did you solve the problem? 

When I try to load the package vegan, I get this error
>library(vegan)
Error : .onLoad failed in loadNamespace() for 'tcltk', details:
  call: system2("otool", c("-L", shQuote(DLL)), stdout = TRUE)
  error: error in running command


and when I try to load tcltk I get this error

> library(tcltk)

Error : .onLoad failed in loadNamespace() for 'tcltk', details:
  call: system2("otool", c("-L", shQuote(DLL)), stdout = TRUE)
  error: error in running command
Error: package or namespace load failed for ?tcltk?
sh: otool: command not found


Many thanks in advance, 

Laura

Parallels allows you to give regular Windows-style drive letters to
imported directories, so you should do that.  Put \\psf/Home Documents
on D:/ or some other drive.

You can also use RStudio natively on the Mac.

Howdy,


This is not a vegan issue: see this mailing list about the problems other people had with tcltk (tcltk is the key issue).


Next version of vegan can be loaded without tcltk and there should be patched versions of R-for-Mac that do not suffer with this problem. The next version of vegan can be obtained from http://r-forge.r-project.og/, but it no longer provides Mac binaries. For patched versions of R, see other messages in this mailing list.


Cheers, Jari Oksanen

Hi

When trying to load Vegan in R 3.1.2 under under Mac OS X Mavericks I get the following error. Any idea why?

Problem solved after re-installation of X-Quartz. It seems some libraries were missing after the last update (I don?t know if its R fault or Yosemite operating system update)

thanks anyway

That is actually referenced in the R Installation and Administration Manual:

  http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-admin.html#OS-X

The second paragraph in that section:

"You may also need to install an X sub-system (or you will need to configure using option --without-x): X is part of the standard OS X distribution in versions prior to Mountain Lion, but not always installed. For Mountain Lion and later, see http://xquartz.macosforge.org/. (Note that XQuartz will likely need to be re-installed after an OS upgrade.)"

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Installing from source on OSX 10.10.1 and R 3.2 (devel
	version)
Message-ID: <1179EF5B-54F8-4554-8F8C-95343C7238BC@depauw.edu>

I?m trying to get R 3.2 working fully so I can test my packages before sending to CRAN.  R 3.2 appears to work OK in general terms.  However, when I try to install some packages I need, I run into errors with the libraries that the install process desires.  I get the same or very similar messages from several packages.  Let?s use amap as an example:

install.packages("amap", type = "source")
[?]
ld: warning: directory not found for option '-L/usr/local/lib/gcc/x86_64-apple-darwin13.0.0/4.8.2'
ld: library not found for -lgfortran
clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
make: *** [amap.so] Error 1
ERROR: compilation failed for package ?amap?
* removing ?/Users/bryanhanson/Library/R/3.2/library/amap?
* restoring previous ?/Users/bryanhanson/Library/R/3.2/library/amap?

The full output is appended after this message.  The problem here is clear in one sense: there no directory on my machine by that name, since on Yosemite it is darwin13.4.0 and gcc is at 4.9.2.  xcode and xquartz have been updated.  I don?t know if this is a problem with a symlink on my system or an issue with the amap package  not yet being fully updated for R 3.2 or a problem with R 3.2 or a mangled gcc install.  All suggestions welcome, there?s a good chance I?m being simple-minded here.

Thank you.  Bryan

Bryan,

it means that you have a mismatch between the Fortran compiler used to build R and the one you are using to build packages. Did you remove and/or update Fortran between compiling R and the packages?

Cheers,
Simon

Hi Simon? I never compiled R myself, I just got R-devel-mavericks.pkg from http://r.research.att.com/ (this morning, though I had the same experience about 3 weeks ago,  and gave up, hoping it was something which would go away?).  I did update gcc back in December, this is what I have installed:

> gcc --version
Configured with: --prefix=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr --with-gxx-include-dir=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.10.sdk/usr/include/c++/4.2.1
Apple LLVM version 6.0 (clang-600.0.56) (based on LLVM 3.5svn)
Target: x86_64-apple-darwin14.0.0
Thread model: posix

which I notice has an even newer target.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Still have hangs on Open Dialog Box
Message-ID: <54B44893.9040600@witthoft.com>

I thought this problem had gone away, but it's still hitting me.

Yosemite on a dual-core iMac, R 3.1.2 GUI 1.65 Mavericks build (6833).
I've verified Permissions and Disk, using DiskUtility.

What happens is: I select "Open" from the menu to try to open a new file 
inside R, and I get the OpenDialog window, but the contents of the 
current directory never fill the window; just spinning beachball of 
death.  I thought turning off DefaultFolder helped, but it didn't.  I 
have to force-quit R and delete  the file "com.apple.finder.plist" from 
my Library/Preferences directory to be able to successfully open a file 
from inside R (as opposed to double-clicking on a Finder window's file 
icon) the next time I open R.app GUI .

The only other thing I noticed is that, when R starts up,  a whole pile 
of previously-opened files are displayed and then disappear.  WHen I hit 
the  Mac OSX "F10" function key  to display all current windows 
belonging to R, I got a strange (at least to me) display.  All the 
current windows are displayed but ALSO a long row of mini-icons 
representing previously open (and closed) document windows.  I posted a 
screen shot at  https://app.box.com/s/qutc86rujitb49geur8c  ; this 
appears to match my "Recent" doc list in the File Menu.
I don't know what causes that -- Microsoft Office apps don't do this, 
but TextWrangler and GraphicConverter(for two examples) do.  I  don't 
know  whether it is related to  R's misbehavior on my machine.  All I 
know for certain is that no other application I've tried ever hangs on 
Open dialog boxes.

Any ideas?

Carl

Updated info:  I installed the latest patch version of R from 
research.att.com ,
and there are several things behaving differently.  Now I do not get any 
files opened when I open R, whereas previously all files open when I 
quit R re-opened (even if I'd used quit() and had a normal end of session).
In addition, the Window menu no longer displays windows (such as files 
being edited) which had been closed earlier in my R session.

BUT: I torture-tested by opening about 50 files inside R.  I then 
force-quit R, and then on restart,  R tries to re-open all the files 
again! I'm guessing this is desired behavior, to recover any lost work, 
but it's a bit unnerving.  At the very least, can you advise if there's 
a config file somewhere that I could delete to avoid this recovery mode?

Send all thanks to Apple - this is how the OS behave now - I find it extremely annoying, but AFAIK the app has no control over it, because they come as regular open request to the app.

That said, nothing really changed on the R side - we didn't touch the R.app for almost a year, so whatever you may be seeing has to do wither with your OS or the build you picked.

Cheers,

Ah, there was no announcement other than the discussions on requiring texinfo 5.1+ in R-devel and the NEWS: 
? ?configure? requires the ?texi2any? script from ?texinfo? 5.1 or later, in place of the ?makeinfo? program.
Since OS X ships with old texinfo we have to use a custom build. FWIW all this should really be on R-SIG-Mac - moving there.

Cheers,
Simon

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Mac Yosemite R.app console typing / autorepeat
	performance
Message-ID: <4733F881-E72B-444E-B662-BFCFBDAEF7FA@vims.edu>

I am having issues with performance in the R.app console on Mac Yosemite / OS X 10.10.1.  

1) While editing commands on the command line, left or right arrow gradually slows within a session from usable rates to rates like 2/second or slower.

2) Autorepeat works differently for different characters:

 # -> ######################################  repeats normally
 f -> f                                       single character
 a -> popup menu of differently-accented ?a? characters.
 arrow keys on an existing command line -> navigate as expected

I?m mostly irritated by the slowing navigation.

On trying to generate a repeatable example, I think it happens from having lots of text in the console window:

# open an R.app session
# try autorepeating ?#' across the console line while counting how many seconds it takes.
# put a lot of output in the window:
rnorm(100000)
# Autorepeat ?#? for the same number of seconds and see how much of the line is filled.   I get about 1/3 of the film as above.

If I do a couple more rnorm(100000)s, the character insertions get queued up and slower than they typing and autorepeat.

Is there a way to limit the scroll-history of the console buffer?

Dave

Hmmm.. you sure that deleting ~/Library/Saved Application

BTW, possibly coincidence, but since installing R version 3.1.2 Patched 
(2015-01-11 r67421)  I've gone 24 hrs without the OpenDialog hanging.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] hangs under Yosemite redux
Message-ID: <54C6A8B0.9070206@witthoft.com>

Back to that question of the gui hanging at commands like "Save As" I 
brought up a few weeks back.   Someone posted a similar question to SO 
and someone else posted the following claim:

"Apparently, this is a bug in R's GUI. Some OS X features/libraries that 
used to be in place in earlier versions of OS X have been removed in 
Yosemite.

You can work around this bug by running R from the terminal / command 
line. Fire up the terminal app (quickest way is to use Spotlight search: 
cmd+space -> terminal), and type the following command:

/Applications/R.app/Contents/MacOS/R
"

Is this possible? rational?  I don't know how Yosemite cranks up an 
executable, so have no idea how booting the R-executable directly might 
differ from a Finder double-click.

What I did find is that the Terminal window gives me the following warnings:

"

2015-01-26 15:48:55.319 R[57903:2792043] Failed to connect 
(cancelButton) outlet from (SelectList) to (NSButton): missing setter or 
instance variable
2015-01-26 15:48:55.319 R[57903:2792043] Failed to connect (okButton) 
outlet from (SelectList) to (NSButton): missing setter or instance variable
"

Tcl/Tk is part of the standard R 3.1.2 installation. You should not have had
to do a separate install (though perhaps you didn't). You shouldn't need
XTools (though if it's installed, I suppose that it should provide otool).

When the tcltk package loads it checks for the presence of otool, which I
believe is intended to determine whether there's a functioning X Windows
(though why this check is used is unclear to me).  This is a relatively new
check and may be source of the problem, or something may be broken in your
system. You might try reinstalling XQuartz and perhaps uninstalling the
Tcl/Tk that you installed separately from R (if you did so).

> > install.packages("tcltk")

This isn't necessary: the  tcltk package is part of the standard R
installation.

There's some problem with the CRAN mirror that you're accessing, but tcltk2
should have been installed along with the Rcmdr package and needn't be
installed in a separate step.

I'm copying this response to the R-SIG-MAC email list and to Simon Urbanek
and Brian Ripley, who are likely to have more insight into your problem that
I do.

Best,
 John

Message-ID: <C203A084-16B4-4D1F-BE63-7E402B08AD9F@stat.ucla.edu>

In my current compiles of R-devel from source (using clang from Yosemite and gfortran from homebrew)
I added "-Wl,-no_compact_unwind" to my LDFLAGS to get around the annoying warning
"create compact unwind for foo: stack subq instruction is too different from dwarf stack"

Yes, but this is nothing to do with R and everything to do with the 
unstated version of gfortran you are using (I see it with 4.9.2 built 
from the sources).

That gcc/gfortran do not play nicely with Apple's linker is something to 
take up with one of them.

Message-ID: <73F781A1-D1F9-4892-878D-B91A9C603014@prodsyse.com>

Hello:  


	  What should I do to diagnose and fix ?pdflatex is not available? from ?R CMD check? on a Mac running OS X 10.10.1 (see below for more details including sessionInfo.)?  


	  A blog on "Building R packages: missing path to pdflatex? (http://www.r-bloggers.com/building-r-packages-missing-path-to-pdflatex/ <http://www.r-bloggers.com/building-r-packages-missing-path-to-pdflatex/>) suggested the following:  


Sys.which("pdflatex?) 
# "" 
Sys.getenv("PATH")
# [1] "/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin?


	  However, the suggested fix did not work for me.  


		    1.  How can I determine if pdflatex is installed?  


		    2.  If it is, how can I find it?  If it?s not, what i the recommended install procedure?  


	  Thanks 
	  Spencer Graves
