Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Install error for gmm package
Message-ID: <1485444289.7495505.1680416102858.JavaMail.zimbra@omu.edu.tr>

Hi everyone, 

I have Macbook air M2 and I need the "gmm" package. But I cannot install conventionally this package. 
When I install and call this package, I see below error message: 

Loading required package: sandwich

Could you help me? 

Best wishes.

Hasan,

packages shouldn't be using gomp as it is not supported - it seems that gmm is hard-coding -lgomp even if it is not enabled by R. Although this is a bug in gmm (which the authors should fix), you can try to work around it by installing the GNU Fortran compiler as follows:

open the Terminal (under Application->Utilities) and type

cd /tmp
curl -O https://mac.r-project.org/tools/gfortran-12.0.1-20220312-is-darwin20-arm64.tar.xz
sudo tar fxz gfortran-12.0.1-20220312-is-darwin20-arm64.tar.xz -C /

Cheers,
Simon

Hi,

I tried installing the x86_64 alpha available today at https://mac.r-project.org/big-sur-x86_64/R-4.3-branch/R-4.3-branch-x86_64.pkg; however, I'm getting the following error:

installer: Upgrading at base path /

Abort trap: 6

Is this a problem with the .pkg file?

Hi Jen,

could you please report your macOS version, e.g. via sessionInfo()? Is 
it at least 11?

Sorry, thank you for kindly reminding me!

R aborts so I can't provide sessionInfo(), but that's likely the problem as we're running macOS 10.14.6 Mojave x86_64-apple-darwin18.7.0.

'they' probably cannot run R to run sessionInfo().  Use 'About this Mac' 
from the Apple menu to find the version without R.

The header has

__API_AVAILABLE(macosx(10.15), ios(13.0), tvos(13.0), watchos(6.0))
int timespec_get(struct timespec *ts, int base);

which says timespec_get is available from macOS 10.15 (Catalina)

We have had trouble with this before: configure.ac says

## timespec_get is C11.
## macOS added timespec_get in 10.15 but used 10.15's SDK for 10.14 
(Darwin 18)

and it skips detection for Darwin <= 18.

Jennifer,

that build in only for macOS 11 (Big Sur) and higher, older versions are no longer supported (neither by Apple nor by us). I'll update the installer to disallow installation on older macOS version to avoid confusion.

Thanks,
Simon

Hi Simon,

Maybe I'm off the mark, but:

 > R 4.3.0 CRAN builds are using Xcode 14.2, macOS 11.3 SDK and targetting macOS 
11 (Big Sur)

AFAICT, Xcode 14.x includes an SDK for macOS 12.3 but not one for macOS 11.3.

the SDK version (=system libraries) is independent of the Xcode version (=toolchain version). We are using macOS 11 SDK, because we want the binaries to run on macOS 11. R packages typically don't use run-time weak symbol guards, so they would likely crash when compiled against higher SDK version.

Cheers,
Simon

Message-ID: <19B7BFE5-2BB9-491D-99A2-BF572A5B41D1@R-project.org>

Dear Mac users,

the next major R release R 4.3.0 is coming very soon so I would like to ask you to, please, test the pre-releases from

https://mac.R-project.org

such that any possible new issues are detected *before* the release. The upcoming release will be for macOS 11 and higher only to leverage new compilers (important for modern C++ support) and libraries. As usual, there are two releases: one for the older Intel Macs (x86_64) and one for the new M1/M2 Macs (arm64) - please install the matching version.

R users can stop reading here, just test, please!

Package developers, please check the CRAN result pages for your package to make sure it passes checks. Also please note that we are now using a universal GNU Fortran compiler that works both on Intel and arm64 Macs - you can download an Apple Installer from
https://mac.r-project.org/tools/

There are two major changes for the Intel build relevant to advanced users:

a) .Platfrom$pkgType is "mac.binary.big-sur-x86_64" since we are targeting a new macOS version (this is to match arm64 which uses "mac.binary.big-sur-arm64"). It means that binaries for contributed packages in repositories live in bin/macosx/big-sur-x86_64/contrib/4.3.

b) the Intel build now matches the arm64 build such that dependent libraries are expected in /opt/R/x86_64 (to match arm64's /opt/R/arm64) to avoid conflicts with other tools. You can still add -I/usr/local/include to CPPFLAGS or -L/usr/local/lib to LDFLAGS if you want to use 3rd party libraries from /usr/local (refer to R and package documentation for details).

Finally, R will no longer sets the macos-version-min flag by default, which means R will build for the currently installed macOS version. This allows users to build packages that use the latest SDK and capabilities of the latest macOS without any changes. However, if you are distributing package binaries for use others, we strongly recommend that you set

export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=11.0

when compiling binaries which will make sure that they will run on macOS 11 and higher, otherwise your binary may not be compatible.

CRAN also uses the macOS11 SDK via

export SDKROOT=/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX11.sdk

However, depending on your Xcode version you may not have such SDK, so it is optional.

Cheers,
Simon

I have GNU Fortran (GCC) 12.0.1 20220312 (experimental)

in /opt/R/arm64/gfortran/bin/gfortran

Should it be uninstalled/removed in some way before installing
gfortran-12.2-universal.pkg, and if so, how?

Thanks, G?ran

Not necessary, as the newer compiler installs into /opt/gfortran.  You 
may need to change FC and FLIBS in a ~/.R/Makevars if you use one, and 
you may need to adjust your path if you use Fortran other than for R 
packages.

To remove the older version, delete /opt/R/arm64/gfortran/ .

The OpenMP binaries provided here

     https://mac.r-project.org/openmp/

still have the usr/local/ prefix.  Is that intentional?  If that prefix were
simply deleted, then users could unpack with (for example)

     tar -xvf openmp-14.0.6-darwin20-Release.tar.gz -C /opt/R/$(uname -m)

And then not need

     CPPFLAGS += -I/usr/local/include
     LDFLAGS += -L/usr/local/lib

just to include the header or link the shared library.

Hi Simon.

I'm seeing crashes when I try to compile rgl and run it in the new R on 
my Intel notebook.  I only installed R, I didn't update all the 
libs/tools/etc.

The crash report is copied below.  One oddity I notice on the 4th line 
of the report:  it says it is running "R 4.2.3 GUI 1.79 Big Sur Intel 
build (8220)".  When I run R.app and `version`, I see

 > version
                _
platform       x86_64-apple-darwin20
arch           x86_64
os             darwin20
system         x86_64, darwin20
status         RC

language       R
version.string R version 4.3.0 RC (2023-04-13 r84266)
nickname       Already Tomorrow

but when I choose "About R" in the GUI, I see 4.2.3 reported.  Maybe 
I've got both installed, and that's the cause of the crash?

Sorry, I think that was (mostly) a false alarm.  I may have had some old 
object files which weren't recompiled after the install; at least after 
a new clean build I'm not seeing the crash any more.

The bad version report in R.app is still there.

Mikael,

the OpenMP binaries are entirely unrelated to the R release. Also you cannot put libiomp anywhere else without modification, because it contains the path and is signed. Given that you need additional flags for OpenMP anyway, this is not really an issue, since you have to know what you are doing in the first place so you need several flags to make this work. If you are interested in OpenMP for your package then I'd suggest trying a static iomp build.

Cheers,
Simon

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] question about using edit() function on mac
Message-ID: <CALfCuu_dOsXKJ7o1zM_fbKuyn_bHaXsib2mXa85EJoSfSq4K9w@mail.gmail.com>

I have a question about using the edit() function inside an R program that
I am running in the standard R console, and on a mac mini with the most
recent OS.

 (1) I was wondering if there is a way to programmatically control the
screen location where the edit window appears, and the size of the edit
window.

(2) I also notice that the edit window for an array with say 4 columns
shows up with a fifth column that is empty and that stretches all the way
across to the right edge of the screen. Can I suppress this extra empty
column from showing up?

(3) Finally, and less importantly to me, is there any way to select the
font style and the font size that is used in the edit window?
Write to R

I believe you mean R.app.

I don't think there's anything in R, but it does remember the size from 
invocation to invocation (even across sessions), so it must be saving it 
somewhere.  Maybe if you found that spot you could change the value 
before opening it.

Again, I don't think so:  that wouldn't really be compatible with 
maintaining the size.

As far as I can see, no.

[Moved from R-pkg-devel]

Would that make sense?  You suggest pointing to R-4.3.0-x86_64.pkg, but 
I think fewer and fewer MacOS users would want that, so maybe it's not a 
good idea.

On the other hand, maybe R-latest-arm64.pkg and R-latest-x86_64.pkg 
should be created.

R-experts,

What is going wrong?

At the end of this page there is the installation command :
https://gitlab.science.ru.nl/gbucur/RUcausal/-/blob/master/README.Rmd 

Working with a MAC, I have tried to install the RUcausal library (copy and paste the installation command).

It is written that the package has been built on Linux using the GNU Compiler Collection. To install the package, open an R instance and run:
install.packages('devtools') # required package
devtools::install_git('https://gitlab.science.ru.nl/gbucur/RUcausal')

I get this error message :

  ERROR: package installation failed

It looks like you don?t have fortran.

Varin,

you're missing the Fortran compiler which the package requires. To make the life a bit easier on you, upgrade to R 4.3.0 and then install GNU Fortran from https://mac.r-project.org/tools/

If you don't want to upgrade R then you'll need the Fortran from here: https://github.com/R-macos/gcc-darwin-arm64/releases/tag/R-4.2.0-release

Cheers,
Simon

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] 'Default' macos (x86) download URL now gone?

Dirk,

thanks - the problem is that there is not a single installer package (for several years now), so that URL is ambiguous. Whether the missing link is a good or bad depends on how it is used. I would argue that any link to that URL is inherently bad, because there is no way of knowing that the link works for a particular system - that's why I have originally removed it with the R 4.3.0 release. I have restored it now, making it point to the R 4.3.0 arm64 release since that is arguably the closest to a single "latest R". R releases have not been stored in /bin/macosx since 2015, so anyone using a link there is asking for trouble.

For any CI I would strongly recommend using the "last-success" links: https://mac.r-project.org/big-sur/last-success/ in particular the .xz versions are they are specifically designed to be used by CI (small download, fast and localized install).

Cheers,
Simon

Or if you do have a gfortran installation which does not match that used 
for a binary installation of R you can use a ~/.R/Makevars file, as in 
https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-devel/R-admin.html#Customizing-package-compilation

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] binaries for R 4.3 x86_64
Message-ID: <d8c568987f1b4dee8485fbd0bfde57d0@inserm.fr>

Hi,

I am upgrading to R 4.3.  and trying to upgrade the packages.  I had to upgrade to macOS 12 first because I was at 10 and my 2017 Intel Mac Air doesn't seem to be able to run later versions.  I was looking at the Mac binaries at the R for mac OS page and it looks like both links

big-sur-x86_64 and big-sur-arm64 lead to a page with header:

Index of /bin/macosx/big-sur-arm64

Is this just a heading error or is there a misdirect in the link?

The formalities:

Thank you Uwe for the rapid response,

Any guidance would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you, in advance.

Actually, I was able to update everything from source.  I initially didn't think that would work because of the need to update Xcode and gfortran, but it all worked and none of that was necessary.  Thanks.

This has been fixed a while time ago so I suspect the culprit are outdated mirrors. If in doubt, please use

https://mac.R-project.org/bin/macosx

which is the most up-to-date.

Kenneth,

type="mac.binary" is not appropriate as forces is only for old High-Sierra binaries which don't exist for R 4.3.0 anymore as that build is no longer supported. You should leave type="both" (default, recommended) or type="binary".

Cheers,
Simon

Is this just a heading error or is there a misdirect in the link?

Misdirect, simply replace arm64 by x86_64 in the link for now. I am sure Simon will fix it soon, too.

No, you have fixed the direct link to the binary, but further down the 
page there is a link "big-sur-x86_64" that actally point to thw wrong 
directory.
That is not yet fixed on the master.

Best,
Uwe

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Using Microsoft Access from a Macintosh using R
Message-ID: <D070901D-D616-4571-8EC1-B4C2FBA85D97@icloud.com>

How can I make a Mac get data from a Microsoft Access database using R?

I?m sorry if this has been asked a million times before but the list archives don?t seem to be searchable and the Mac FAQ doesn?t mention this.

Also, I?m asking for a colleague who doesn?t like messing around with a lot of technical computer stuff and I do not have R on my own system. So please be patient.

It seems that there is a package called RODBC which needs to be installed. Is that done using R?s package manager?

And it seems that there is a driver from Actual Technologies with a Mac installer package.

Assuming that these two steps are taken, is there anything else that needs to be done? Can R then access the Access database directly or is there an intermediate step such as an Excel file? Is there a very short MWE
that demonstrates accessing a public Microsoft Access database using this method?

My colleague is thinking of buying a Windows system just to solve this problem!

Many thanks,

Jerry

Hi,

You have identified the key components that you will need, which are the RODBC package:

??https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RODBC/index.html

and the Actual Technologies ODBC driver pack for MS Access:

??https://www.actualtech.com/product_access.php

The latter has some basic installation instructions for that product on the above page, and Actual offers a limited function evaluation option, if you want to try before you buy. Actual also has their own tech support available. The key is using their tools to set up the correct DSN specification for the database that you want to retrieve data from within R.

I used to use the Actual ODBC driver pack for Oracle on my Mac, and it worked quite well, albeit, it has now been a few years since I needed that functionality.

For the RODBC package, it can be installed from within an R session using:

? install.packages("RODBC")

Note that Prof. Ripley has spent a significant amount of time over the years creating a vignette for the RODBC package:

??https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RODBC/vignettes/RODBC.pdf

in addition to the package manual, and I would urge you to review the vignette for helpful information.

That should get you started.

Note also that there is a specific e-mail list for R and databases:

??https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-sig-db

however the traffic on that list has been essentially non-existent for some time, and since this is a Mac specific issue, feel free to continue this thread, or post subsequent questions, here.

Regards,

Marc Schwartz

Simon,

| thanks - the problem is that there is not a single installer package (for several years now), so that URL is ambiguous. Whether the missing link is a good or bad depends on how it is used. I would argue that any link to that URL is inherently bad, because there is no way of knowing that the link works for a particular system - that's why I have originally removed it with the R 4.3.0 release. I have restored it now, making it point to the R 4.3.0 arm64 release since that is arguably the closest to a single "latest R". R releases have not been stored in /bin/macosx since 2015, so anyone using a link there is asking for trouble.

Restoring it _but switching the architecture under it_ is another subtle way
to still break things where the expectation based on a decade+ of prior
practice was that this works:

   installer: Error - R 4.3.0 for macOS (ARM64) can?t be installed on this computer.
   Error: Process completed with exit code 1.

I long have repaired my (main) script in r-ci but this will likely surprise others.

| For any CI I would strongly recommend using the "last-success" links: https://mac.r-project.org/big-sur/last-success/ in particular the .xz versions are they are specifically designed to be used by CI (small download, fast and localized install).

That is a fine idea but no replacement as it leads to a need for a different
deployment and how / where to untar etc.

Maybe you are someone wants to wrap that into a suitable script or 'action
snippet' and document that?   I can't, I don't even have a mac.

Hi Gang:

After hours of debugging, I?m stuck and hoping that someone has an
idea of what the issue is here.  Any hints/tips/etc. are greatly appreciated!

I?m getting this error from my CRAN package, nftbart.  Right now, I?m
preparing for a new release: v1.6.  However, I?m stumped by this error
message that I get when installing with OpenMP.  Without OpenMP,
everything is fine; however, the package benefits greatly from OpenMP.

I am getting the same results for R 4.2.3 and 4.3.0 RC.  The source code is
on github at https://github.com/rsparapa/bnptools.git

So, to demonstrate, you just need to do something like this?


$ git clone https://github.com/rsparapa/bnptools.git DIR

Oh, that was totally self-inflicted.
I had commented out PKG_LIBS in Makevars.in
That does work on Linux with OpenMP somehow.
However, it does NOT with macOS.  Thanks
