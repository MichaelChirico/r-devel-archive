Hi - I'm a postdoc at the University of Edinburgh who's urgently trying to install an older version of a package (Seurat) listed on CRAN but without success. The package is Seurat_4.4.0.tar.gz.

I currently work on a M1 Macbook Pro (with Sonoma installed) with RStudio version 4.3.2 and tried to install the package using the following code:
remotes::install_version(package = 'Seurat', version = package_version('4.4.0'))

However this appears to be unsuccessful - I was wondering if there is any guidance on how to install these on M1 macbooks? I have also tried uninstalling and reinstalling R many times which again did not succeed. Any help you could give me on this would be much appreciated.

BW,
Michael

Michael,

remotes is a contributed package, so you should contact the author if that is what fails (you didn't say). FWIW only the latest version package binaries are available on CRAN, so if you need a specific older version of a package you need to compile it from sources - so chances are you are missing the necessary dependencies or tools to do that, but we can't tell without more details about what exactly fails for you.

Cheers,
Simon

I just tried it with groundhog and seems to have worked.

On R 4.3.1, on a Mac M1, I ran this:

library('groundhog')
groundhog.library('Seurat','2023-11-01')

Uri


ps: you can get release dates of pkgs with groundhog::toc(pkg)

This usually happens when you are on a slow network, and downloading
the archive.rds file fails within the default 60 seconds. You can
increase the timeout from 60 seconds to 600 or even more by setting
the timeout option:

options(timeout = 600)

A more modern option is to use the pak package, which has larger
default timeouts and many other goodies as well:

pak::pkg_install("Seurat at 4.4.0")
