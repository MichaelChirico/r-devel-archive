In many, many places 'in the background', at C level as well as R level. 
  As I said, it is 'pervasive'.

R-devel's NEWS file.

If you develop R packages or if you work with non-ASCII data, consider 
holding off for a quite a while.  But I am not the right person to ask 
-- someone has to try the new versions to find and debug the problems ....

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Compiling a library with Rcpp causing many 'unknown
 type'/'no member named' errors
Message-ID: <YTBPR01MB2943DAFFC5B1297A7A66F1B6C1B0A@YTBPR01MB2943.CANPRD01.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Hi All,

I am having issues with building my package that uses Rcpp in it. Using 'install' I end up with a ton of compilation errors originating from Cpp include files. There are more details on this Stack Overflow post (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77491429/compiling-a-library-with-rcpp-causing-many-unknown-type-no-member-named-erro) including the output errors.

A user there suggested that I may be unable to use anaconda, which I am currently using, as a compiler and should switch to gfortran. However, I we were both unsure of how to direct R to use gfortran instead of anaconda, so he directed me to post to this mailing list. Could the compiler be the issue and if so, how do I switch to gfortran? Is there anything else that might be wrong?

Thanks,
Brian

Brian,

you are using Anaconda so all bets are off since that is not supported by CRAN. It looks like a broken compiler/runtime combination in Anaconda so your best bet would be to contact their support as this is unrelated to R (updating Anaconda sounds like an obvious first step, hoping the compiler/runtime issue has been fixed in newer version). I would recommend removing Anaconda and using released CRAN R version and Apple tools instead if you want a stable solution.

Cheers,
Simon

This problem appears to be solved with a new update to Mac OS Sonoma (14.1.1). The original R.app GUI (R 4.3.1 GUI) (not including the ?hack? fix kindly provided by Simon) now works like a charm. Deep sigh of relief all round.

Subject: How can I stop my R console and other R windows "flickering" after I updated my Mac OS to Sonoma 14.0?
Dear All,

I updated my Apple Silicon M1 Pro MacBook from Ventura to Sonoma 14.0. I have the latest version of R for Apple Silicon (4.3.1, "Beagle Scouts"). I also have the latest version of XQuartz (2.8.5).

On Ventura, my R setup worked fine ("classic" R.app GUI using console and script windows, not Rstudio or terminal). However, with Sonoma, when I try and toggle between the R console and an R script, the windows transition at very high speed between each other, making it nearly impossible to select either the console or the script.

This "flickering" phenomenon lasts for ~ 10-15 seconds each time I change windows between console and script, making the software nearly unusable. Changing the screen refresh rate does not help.

The problem is specific for R.app and does not affect other software.

Any suggestions gratefully received. I have also posted this question to stackoverflow.

Many thanks,

Desmond Smith

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Nightly builds of R-devel?
Message-ID: <17808c1b-66f5-4298-8616-9e2b0611c017@mailbox.org>

Hi Simon


I wonder if it's possible to provide more up-to-date builds of R-devel 
for macOS, via https://mac.r-project.org/ . I'd like to be able to "just 
install" the latest and greatest R version. As of today, the most recent 
is from the end of October, and it looks like three of my packages only 
break with an R-devel version more recent than that. Thanks!

Downstream issue: https://github.com/r-lib/rig/issues/204 .


Best regards

Kirill

Kirill,

Due to the necessary iconv workarounds for Sonoma introduced in the R 4.3.2 build, it complicates the automated nightly builds (they cannot reuse the same VM anymore) so the nightly process needs to be updated. I'm currently traveling so it will be restored when I get back later next week. Sorry about any inconvenience.

Cheers,
Simon
