Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] R.research.att.com maintenanace
Message-ID: <10D79B04-8E74-40C5-94EE-B76E4511F59A@R-project.org>

This is just a heads-up that we will be performing maintenance on the R.research.att.com machine. It is fairly old, disks are dying and it needs some overhaul. I'll try to expand the capacity while at it, but there may be downtime (if something goes wrong). It may happen today or early next week. The impact should be limited to the main Mac CRAN source, Mac devel site and maybe Mac checks - most of the other services (like bugs and general devel page) have been already migrated to a newer machine.

Cheers,
Simon

Message-ID: <CAC2h7usdg_iGVXB3uLXxQq3QVctOKY_aoMg-FDGBc+5wrcHHuQ@mail.gmail.com>

For timing purposes, is it possible to control the number of threads /
cores when I have compiled R to use the BLAS in the Accelerate framework
(by building R using
  ./configure --with-blas="-framework Accelerate" --with-lapack
)

? (The alternative is of course to build R using the supplied
single-threaded BLAS)

Best,
Kasper

This is a question about Accelerate not R.  But the R-admin manual does say

'In recent versions of macOS, threading in Accelerate is controlled by 
?Grand Central Dispatch? and is said not to need user control.'

It has quite a few other caveats about Accelerate, not least that it 
uses an LAPACK which is missing many bug fixes, some serious.

Thanks for the extremely helpful pointers on this.  Clearly I need to
remove --with-lapack in my configure step.

It seems the nightly R-devel builds have stopped updating. The last
one available seems to be from April 5th, R Under development
(unstable) (2018-04-05 r74542)

That also seems to be the date of the last log available at
http://r.research.att.com/log-R-devel.el-capitan.x86_64.html

I did not see anything on the maining list about this being
deliberate, apologies if I missed something.

Message-ID: <B3058AB3-4869-4E61-AB44-3D2255626005@plessthan.com>

R 3.5.0 (but problem predates this version)
OS X 10.13.6

Colleagues 

On occasion, I encounter an odd problem with multipage PDFs created by R (using the pdf command):
	I open the document in Preview, then I display the thumbnails in the sidebar.
	I then click on a particular thumbnail ? instead of selecting that thumbnail, Preview selects the one above or below.  
	This prevents me from copying the thumbnail of interest.

This might be a problem in Preview but I doubt that I would be able to get an answer via Apple support.  Has anyone in the R / OS X community experienced this?  If so, any solutions?

Hello,

I am having a similar problem now.

If I click on the console at either the ?Source script or load data in R?  or the ?Open document in editor? icons, I get the following message, but everything works fine:

objc[7032]: Class FIFinderSyncExtensionHost is implemented in both /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/FinderKit.framework/Versions/A/FinderKit (0x7fffb40dac90) and /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/FileProvider.framework/OverrideBundles/FinderSyncCollaborationFileProviderOverride.bundle/Contents/MacOS/FinderSyncCollaborationFileProviderOverride (0x10e497cd8). One of the two will be used. Which one is undefined.

A similar issue has been reported when running Python on HIgh Sierra, and it seems to be related to Tcl/Tk in High Sierra. 

https://github.com/jarvisteach/appJar/issues/285

However, if I load R Commander and then try to run or open a script by clicking the R console icons, R freezes, and I have to force quit.

I am running High Sierra on am iMac with 32 GB RAM.

A heads up:

The Mojave update removes /usr/include and (re)installing the Command 
Line Tools does not put the standard system headers there.  Workarounds 
are now described in the R-admin manual for R-devel and R-patched.

Thanks, Brian,

Yes, we have previously learned the hard way that timing R releases too close to MacOS updates is a bad idea...

The manual updates haven't made it to CRAN yet, you need to look in the sources. 

For those who might be curious, but lazy:

>>>> 
As from macOS 10.14 (?Mojave?) an additional step is needed to install the headers to /usr/include: from a Terminal run

sudo installer -pkg \
/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages/macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10.14.pkg \
-target /

Alternatively, change the include path via

CPPFLAGS="-isystem /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/include"
<<<<


Incidentally, probably unrelated, I discovered that the R-patched snapshots had stalled since Sep 13 due to an SVN database error. This should be cleared up now.

Hi Tim,

Be sure that you are running the latest version of Xcode:

  https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12

and that you also install/re-install the command line tools afterwards:

  xcode-select --install

With a major macOS version upgrade like this, you should do a fully clean install of R and afterwards, of XQuartz:

  https://www.xquartz.org

Regards,

Marc

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] possible bug in R's make install
Message-ID: <CAC2h7uvtuYEj6_QKBs6xxa5-46PKY3D9Z+ucG05G7rM=AuAE3Q@mail.gmail.com>

I am trying to compile and install R under High Sierra with Accelerate BLAS
but with R lapack.

My relevant configure call is   --with-blas="-framework Accelerate" but
omitting --with-lapack. Full call is pasted at the end of this email

I can do
  make
  make check
but make install fails with

make[2]: Nothing to be done for `install'.
/usr/local/clang6/bin/clang -I. -I../../src/include
-I../../../R-3.5.x-src/src/include -I/opt/X11/include -I/usr/local/include
-DHAVE_CONFIG_H    -Wall -mtune=native -g -O2  -L/usr/local/clang6/lib
-L/usr/local/lib -L/usr/local/opt/tcl-tk/lib

mkdir /usr/local/R/R-3.5.x/lib/R/modules
cp: /usr/local/R/R-3.5.x/lib/R/lib/libRlapack.dylib: No such file or
directory
make[3]: *** [install] Error 1
make[2]: *** [install] Error 1
make[1]: *** [install] Error 1
make: *** [install] Error 1

I manually verified that libRlapack.dylib had been build in the building
directory's "lib".  I then just did

sudo mkdir /usr/local/R/R-3.5.x/lib/R/lib

(my installation directory is /usr/local/R/R-3.5.x) and redid make install
which now worked.  I get

$ ls /usr/local/R/R-3.5.x/lib/R/lib
libRlapack.dylib

My _guess_ is that since I am using R's lapack and system BLAS that the
RHOME/lib directory does not get created.

Btw., this might be a bad idea (happy to hear about this) but the
installation should work since I can do make check

For what it's worth, the same bug is present on linux when compiling R
with a custom BLAS (either ATLAS or OpenBLAS). The directory needs to
be made by hand first. I beleive I have reported this some time ago
but no action was taken. Compiling R with R internal BLAS does not
results in the error.

Thanks Marc!

I didn't think the `xcode-select --install` was needed any longer.
Did that and all worked well with the `macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10.14.pkg`
install.

Many thanks again!

Excellent, as CRAN currently is not processing packages (but will start 
again on Mondy.

Best,

I'll try to expand the capacity while at it, but there may be downtime (if something goes wrong). It may happen today or early next week. The impact should be limited to the main Mac CRAN source, Mac devel site and maybe Mac checks - most of the other services (like bugs and general devel page) have been already migrated to a newer machine.
