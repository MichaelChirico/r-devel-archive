Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] fcaR plot not working
Message-ID: <E6AA1A3A-8565-44A0-9376-99409A478CF8@gmail.com>

Hello,
I have a MacBook Air M1

I newly installed R and R studio. Also fcaR(formal concept analysis for R).
I followed fcaR via the help files.
Finally I did fc_planets$standardize() : worked.
Then: fc_planets$concepts$plot()
Warning message:
You have not installed the 'hasseDiagram' package, which is needed to plot the lattice.
So, I installed:
install.packages("hasseDiagram?)
Then: library("hasseDiagram?)
Finally:
  fc_planets$concepts$plot()
It gave:
Warning in install.packages :
  dependencies ?Rgraphviz?, ?graph? are not available
trying URL 'https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/macosx/big-sur-arm64/contrib/4.4/hasseDiagram_0.2.0.tgz'
Content type 'application/x-gzip' length 37789 bytes (36 KB)
==================================================

No idea what to do to get a plot of the lattice. 
Any help would be appreciated.
Peter

Hi Peter:

I don?t know what the graph package is.  But Rgraphviz is an archived package on CRAN?

Both are current Bioconductor packages, so their software repository 
needs to be selected.

This is not really a macOS question.  On any platform

setRepositories(ind = c(1:4))
install.packages(c('fcaR', 'hasseDiagram'))

should work: I tested a vanilla R 4.4.1 on arm64 macOS.

Peter,

hasseDiagram unfortunately depends on packages outside of CRAN, namely in Bioconductor, so you have to add the corresponding repositories before you install it, e.g.:

setRepositories(ind=1:4)
install.packages("hasseDiagram")
# also installing the dependencies ?BiocGenerics?, ?Rgraphviz?, 'graph?

Ideally, hasseDiagram would warn the user and provide an informative error, but that you?d have to take up with the author.

Cheers,
Simon
