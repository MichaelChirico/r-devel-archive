Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] R 3.3.1 for OS X 10.7.5
Message-ID: <F04B3C8A-BF62-4E51-B1DD-235F4EA3E4FA@email.it>

As a long run user of R on linux and mac os x I'm an absolute beginner with this list. 
I have been smoothly using R on my macbook with Lion 10.7.5 regularly updating it by means of the CRAN binary precompiled distributions also resorting to http://r.research.att.com/. 
Now I see that the new version  3.3.1 is only available for Mavericks 10.9 and there's no a precompiled distribution (even in http://r.research.att.com/).
Does this mean that from now on support for Lion (or Snowleopard) binary precompiled distribution is terminated forever or is there a way to compile R 3.3.1?
Should I stick forever to 3.2.5?
Ciao
Vittorio

 From the manual (and please do follow the posting guide and read it):

C.3 OS X

(?OS X? will be renamed to ?macOS? from version 10.12 ?macOS Sierra? in 
late 2016.)

The instructions here are for ?x86_64? builds on 10.9 (Mavericks) or 
later. In principle58 R can be built for 10.6 to 10.8 but these have not 
been tested recently.

and the footnote says

[58] It will be necessary to install later versions of software such as 
libcurl.

You do realize that your OS is long unsupported by Apple and has 
insecure versions of a lot of its system software?

Message-ID: <SN2PR01MB2189366A1EE42DEC131BC685F7ED0@SN2PR01MB2189.prod.exchangelabs.com>

Hi,

I'm having trouble reading into R an access table (.accdb) with a Mac OS X 10.11.6 

I've created a DSN connection to my data base so when I use the odbcConnect function it returns:

RODBC Connection 1
Details:
     case=nochange
     DSN=mydsn
     UID=Admin
     PWD=******

So when I try to use sqlQuery(channel, "SELECT * Table")
Returns
[1] "HY000 0 [Actual][Access] near \"Table\": syntax error"
[2] "RODBC ERROR: Could not SQLExecDirect 'SELECT * Table'"

Please help me, I'm not familiar with Access at all.

And what ODBC driver are you using?  AFAIK Microsoft does not provide 
one, and the precise SQL syntax needed depends on the driver.

However, this is nothing to do with R, Macs or RODBC. I guess you meant

sqlQuery(channel, "SELECT * from Table")

and need to learn some basic SQL.  (Also, sqlFetch() would appear to do 
this job for you.)

could this be the problem?

If you had Googled it, you'd found:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9689104/installing-r-on-mac-warning-messages-setting-lc-ctype-failed-using-c

with the solution:

Open Terminal
Write or paste in: defaults write org.R-project.R force.LANG en_US.UTF-8
Close Terminal
Start R

Try this and see what happens after.
Hope this helps,
Adrian

I'm not sure this is really a mac question but since there is a mac issue with downloading that I have solved with package::download I offer this suggestion. Need to know your working or target directory name (or create it with path.expand) since download.file does not do path expansion.


Also note that your url is either malformed or at the very least confusing. Cannot tell if it is https: or http:. Should just be:


fileUrl <-
"http://data.baltimorecity.gov/api/views/dz54-2aru/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD"

# Then with downloader installed and assuming that a ./data/ subdirectory exists:

library(downloader)
download( fileUrl, destfile=path.expand("./data/cameras.csv")

Note that it would be more typical on a Mac to see "~/" than "./" or to see a setwd("./data") call.

Hi Valentina:

That's ok...that's how it downloads.

If you do
file.show("cameras.csv")

you will see your file

That's not an error message.

It's actually telling you that you got 9443 bytes. If the first number were 0, then you would be concerned (and you would have seen some sort of error message).

If you saw messed up output like that, you're probably using RStudio, 
which doesn't display download.file output properly.  In other front 
ends this would appear as a progress report.

Does anyone else see this?  It?s not a big deal, mostly cosmetic.  Thanks, Bryan

Start Mac R.app GUI
Open an existing .R file.
Click in the file.
The following warning appears in the console:

From that point forward everything works normally.

I see this was also noticed in Dec 2014 but I can't see that there was ever any resolution:

Message-ID: <3AF705E0-3F46-403E-AC78-E910A6C3D1C9@email.it>

I'm trying for the first time to compile R 3.3.1 on my old macbook with 10.7.5.
Among other things I have already successfully installed the xz port (which includes lzma) from the macports collection (xz-devel is now included in xz).
When as root user I launch  './configure'  the configure process stops with the following error:

$ ./configure
...........
...........
checking if bzip2 version >= 1.0.6... yes
checking whether bzip2 support suffices... no
checking for lzma_version_number in -llzma... no
configure: error: "liblzma library and headers are required"

I'm getting stuck here. Please help
Ciao

The problem is that MacPorts puts its packages in a location where a standard installation of R will not find them. It might be easier for you to install from the collection provided here (at least it is for me and I'm not particularly facile with Unix installations)):

Thanks to David advice I was able to overcome the lzma problem compiling the xz package downloaded from the suggested site.
Now my R 3.3.1 configure process is stuck to another point:
./configure
..................
checking pcre.h usability... yes
checking pcre.h presence... yes
checking for pcre.h... yes
checking pcre/pcre.h usability... no
checking pcre/pcre.h presence... no
checking for pcre/pcre.h... no
checking if PCRE version >= 8.10, < 10.0 and has UTF-8 support... no
checking whether PCRE support suffices... configure: error: pcre >= 8.10 library and headers are required
..............

Even though I downloaded and successfully installed the pcre-8.36.tar.bz2 file from the same http://r.research.att.com/src/ site (in /usr/local/include I can see the freshly installed pcre.h file).

How can I solve the problem ?
Ciao from Rome

Better advice is in the manual, at 
https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-admin.html#OS-X 
(although there is no guarantee that all of the binary packages will 
work with 10.7, many of them will).  And for PCRE, at 
https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-admin.html#Essential-programs-and-libraries 
.

Dear all

I am having some problems with your package.

The newest OS X doesn't support X11 (I am not sure if you use it)

I am also trying to install the package on Microsoft R
https://mran.microsoft.com <https://mran.microsoft.com/>


Below the errors from the installation:
