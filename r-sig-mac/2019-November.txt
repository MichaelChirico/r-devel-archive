Message-ID: <9abac6b3-d892-568e-2523-2fe1782af576@prodsyse.com>

Hello, All:


 ????? How can I get the dev files for libjpeg installed under macOS 
10.15.1 Catalina?


 ????? Simon Urbanek, the maintainer for the "jpeg" package, said I need 
them to install the "jpeg" package from sources.? I'm unable to get that 
package to install either as a binary or from sources;? see below.


 ????? Suggestions?
 ????? Thanks,
 ????? Spencer Graves

You probably have the right tools, but it wouldn't hurt to check:


https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools/


And have you installed the libjpeg library from the /libs/ directory?


http://mac.r-project.org/libs/

The directions for installation from a Terminal session are at the 
bottom of the page.

I have not updated to Catalina, but the error message suggested that 
jpeglib.h could not be found.


Hope this helps;

David

 ????? Thanks or the reply.? I tried to (re)install both the tools and 
libjpeg with apparent success.


 ????? However, when I tried "install.packages()" again, I got the same 
error message as before.


 ????? Other thoughts, e.g., diagnostic tests?


 ????? Thanks again.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] macOS Catalina problems due to C++ ABI changes
Message-ID: <4F9B2468-B48B-423D-971B-FF5A2443209B@waebers.de>

Dear Mac / R users,

the Stan project has currently some major issues with bringing RStan to work smoothly under macOS Catalina. RStan requires compilation of Stan models in C++ und makes heavy use of C++ exceptions. The handling of C++ exceptions seems to have bugs whenever macOS Catalina libc++ libraries are mixed with those distributed with R binaries which are in use with the recommended clang7 for R 3.6.1. An example code based on Rcpp to illustrate the issue with the exception is found here:

https://discourse.mc-stan.org/t/dealing-with-catalina/11285/195?u=wds15 <https://discourse.mc-stan.org/t/dealing-with-catalina/11285/195?u=wds15>

The throw_exception() function is expected to display under R ?this is an exception?, but the buggy behavior leads to a message of ?unkown exception?.

The example does work fine if R is installed under macOS and all packages are installed from source (and the XCode clang is used). In that case the exceptions work fine. Oddly, if you load just a single R package like readr, which involves C++ code and is installed as binary from CRAN, then the faulty behavior occurs again.

After some debugging of the problem there appears to be a solution to the problem on macOS Catalina. A solution is posted here:

https://discourse.mc-stan.org/t/dealing-with-catalina-ii/11802/42?u=wds15 <https://discourse.mc-stan.org/t/dealing-with-catalina-ii/11802/42?u=wds15>

In short, the described problems can be avoided by using the C++ libraries from clang only OR by avoiding the use of the libc++abi.1.dylib of the macOS system and instead using the ABI of the R libraries.

To me this sounds as if there was an ABI change in the distributed macOS Catalina C++ libraries. This would be very problematic with anything where a R package links against a system installed tool.

Maybe this should be considered in the binary packages of R for macOS, but I am not sure what is best here (it looks to me like a bug in Apples ABI). In any case, I do think that this problem needs consideration for future Mac binary packages distributed by CRAN.

Best,
Sebastian

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Error message reading files in R Commander
Message-ID: <91252D97-8867-46DD-BD17-431533E2110C@upr.edu>

Hi,

I am using R Commander in combination with RStudio. I configured RStudio to display the output on the RStudio console.

If I open a file in R Commander, then view the data file in R Commander and then try to read the same file again using R Commander, the following error message is displayed in the console and I cannot read the file with R Commander:

> Error in structure(.External(.C_dotTcl, ...), class = "tclObj") : 
>   [tcl] bad window path name ?.29?.

The message is always the same, except that the number at the end changes. Here are a few more examples:

> Error in structure(.External(.C_dotTcl, ...), class = "tclObj") : 
>   [tcl] bad window path name ".35".

> Error in structure(.External(.C_dotTcl, ...), class = "tclObj") : 
>   [tcl] bad window path name ".51".

> Error in structure(.External(.C_dotTcl, ...), class = "tclObj") : 
>   [tcl] bad window path name ".56".


Initially, I thought there could be a problem between R Commander and RStudio, but I got the same error message under the same conditions when I tested using R Commander with R alone (without RStudio).

The files seem to be fine, since I can access them directly with R or with RStudio.

My computer is  an iMac (27-inch, late 2012)
MacOS High Sierra version 10.13.6.  
R version 3.6.1
RStudio version 1.2.5001
R Commander version 2.6-0
XQuartz 2.7.11

Thanks.

I suggest that you contact the package maintainer (and author),

if you don't get a useful answer here.

Dear Jose,

I'm afraid that I can't duplicate this problem. I tried with the current CRAN version of the Rcmdr under RStudio, reading a text file repeatedly into the same data set. My session info is

The output that the Rcmdr generates each time in the RStudio console is

Rcmdr>  Duncan <- 
Rcmdr+    read.table("/Users/johnfox/Documents/Courses/2017-2018/ICPSR/Lectures/Duncan.txt",
Rcmdr+     header=TRUE, sep="", na.strings="NA", dec=".", strip.white=TRUE)
RcmdrMsg: [3] NOTE: The dataset Duncan has 45 rows and 4 columns.

Of course, there's a warning each time that Duncan will be overwritten, and the dataset in the viewer is automatically refreshed. That is, AFAICS everything works as it should.

You can find the data file I used at <https://socialsciences.mcmaster.ca/jfox/Books/RCommander/Duncan.txt>.

Can you elaborate what you did and ideally create a reproducible example of the problem?

Best,
 John

Dear Jos?,

Please keep the discussion on the r-sig-mac list rather than replying only to me, so that other potentially interested individuals can follow it. I'm therefore cc'ing this response to the list.

That's different from what I understood. When you use the "Data set" button in the Rcmdr toolbar you can choose among data sets that have *already* been read into the workspace, assuming that there are more than one.

I still can't duplicate the problem that you report. I can repeatedly select a data set using the button, and each time it becomes the active data set and the data viewer window is refreshed.

> I had the same issue when I tested with R Commander and R, without RStudio.

Yes, I saw that and I can't duplicate the problem in either context.

Best,
 John

Dear John,

To keep the session as simple as possible, this time I did not configure R Commander to send the output to the R console.

This is what I did.

1.  Load the file/workspace using R Commander.

2. Read the data set using R Commander?s ?Data set? button.

3. View the data set using R Commander?s ?View data set button?.

4. Close the ?View data set? window. 

5. Try to read the same data set using R Commander?s ?Data set? button.

This is the error message I got today. It was displayed in the R Console, not in the R Commander output window .

> Error in structure(.External(.C_dotTcl, ...), class = "tclObj") : 
>   [tcl] bad window path name ".3".



Additional information:

I tried to ?Refresh the active data set? from the ?Data?  ->  ?Active Data set? menu, and got the same error message, but with a different number at the end.

> Error in structure(.External(.C_dotTcl, ...), class = "tclObj") : 
>   [tcl] bad window path name ".6".


I saved the file with a different name, but when I tried to read the file with the new name I got a similar error message.
 
> Error in structure(.External(.C_dotTcl, ...), class = "tclObj") :

Thanks for your time.

What does this mean? What is a "file/workspace"? How did you "load" it with the R Commander? Can you share the "file/workspace" so that I can replicate what you did?

As I said in my earlier response, the R Commander's "Data set" button doesn't "read" a data set -- it chooses from among data frames currently in the user's R workspace.

Do you really mean a *file* -- that is stored on your computer's file system -- or a data frame in the R workspace? 

In either case, if you can share the file or data frame, creating a reproducible example, I'd be much more likely to be able to figure out what's happening.

Best,
 John

Dear John.

My apologies, and thanks for your patience. This is what I did today:

1. I read the data set using the R Commander menu ?Data?  -> ?Load dataset?.  When I am working with an R workspace, I load the workspace with the ?Data?  ->  ?Load dataset? menu, and then read the specific data set in the work space with the ?Data set? button.

2. Viewed the data set using R Commander?s ?View data set button?.

3. Closed the ?View data set? window. 

4. Try to read the same data set using R Commander?s ?Data set? button.

Then I get the error message.

After I found the problem with my files, I tested with a few data sets from the packages in R available thorough the ?Data?  ->  ?Data in packages? menu and had the same results. The files are: CO2, airquality  and ChickWeight included in the ?datasets? package, and ethanol from the ?lattice? package.

Dear Jos?,

As a general matter and an ideal, users should *never* see errors in the Rcmdr code -- the Rcmdr should ideally intercept all errors.

I'm now able to reproduce the error you reported. I believe that I've fixed it in the development version 2.7-0 of the Rcmdr package on R-Forge. I should test the fix some more, but if it holds up, I'll also apply it to Rcmdr 2.6-2 when and if that's submitted to CRAN.

If you want to try Rcmdr 2.7-0, you can download the source tree for the package from R-Forge via svn and build and install it yourself.

Also see some comments below:

Once again, the "Data set" button doesn't read a data set, it just makes a data frame in your R workspace the active data set in the Rcmdr. It also closes and reopens the data set viewer for the data set if such a window is open. The source of the error was that the Rcmdr didn't detect that you had closed the viewer window for the data set.

Please see my preceding remark.

These aren't files but data frames residing in memory. 

I apologize if these distinctions seem pedantic, but the failure to make them made it hard for me to understand your original report of the problem.

Thank you for the bug report.

John

> I tested with a few data sets from the packages in R available thorough the ?Data?  ->  ?Data in packages? menu and had the same results. The files are: CO2, airquality  and ChickWeight included in the ?datasets? package, and ethanol from the ?lattice? package.

Dear Jos?,

As a general matter and an ideal, users should *never* see errors in the Rcmdr code -- the Rcmdr should ideally intercept all errors.

I'm now able to reproduce the error you reported. I believe that I've fixed it in the development version 2.7-0 of the Rcmdr package on R-Forge. I should test the fix some more, but if it holds up, I'll also apply it to Rcmdr 2.6-2 when and if that's submitted to CRAN.

If you want to try Rcmdr 2.7-0, you can download the source tree for the package from R-Forge via svn and build and install it yourself.

Also see some comments below:

Once again, the "Data set" button doesn't read a data set, it just makes a data frame in your R workspace the active data set in the Rcmdr. It also closes and reopens the data set viewer for the data set if such a window is open. The source of the error was that the Rcmdr didn't detect that you had closed the viewer window for the data set.

Please see my preceding remark.

These aren't files but data frames residing in memory. 

I apologize if these distinctions seem pedantic, but the failure to make them made it hard for me to understand your original report of the problem.

Thank you for the bug report.

John

> I tested with a few data sets from the packages in R available thorough the ?Data?  ->  ?Data in packages? menu and had the same results. The files are: CO2, airquality  and ChickWeight included in the ?datasets? package, and ethanol from the ?lattice? package.
