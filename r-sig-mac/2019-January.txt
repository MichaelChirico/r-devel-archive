Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Incorrect help reference for OS X
Message-ID: <B8DBAD1D-F4E1-4059-8585-962EBE947F30@sh.se>

On startup of R version 3.5.2 for x86_64-apple-darwin15.6.0
I get the following:
?WARNING: You're using a non-UTF8 locale, therefore only ASCII characters will work.
Please read R for Mac OS X FAQ (see Help) section 9 and adjust your system preferences accordingly.?
I think it is section 7 that is intended.

If anyone else is also interested in this, I found a satisfactory
solution to prompt for passwords in R.app using AppleScript. It is now
available in the 'askpass' package on CRAN.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Extra Returns Accumulate in Console When Recalling
 Comands via History
Message-ID: <22793E72-5EBD-4DD0-AD05-778399D073C9@depauw.edu>

I don?t think this has been reported previously.  I?m running R 3.6 updating every few weeks.  Recently (roughly last month), I?ve noticed that for each command that is issued, an extra return is added in the console if one uses the up arrow to retrieve a previously used command from the history.

To reproduce, give a command like

mean(rnorm(100))

then use the up arrow to re-run the command, and one gets an extra return in the console added for each re-running.  Simply writing a command, not using the history, doesn?t do this, so it looks like an extra return is being added when the  history is accessed.

Thanks, Bryan
