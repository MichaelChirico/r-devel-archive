Further to Simon's instructions, point two, rerunning javareconf: if you want to
reconfigure Java in R to produce universal binaries, then specify the --arch=
switch for R. ?I ran the command line once with --arch=i386 and once with
--arch=x86_64 to produce a single version of rJava for both architectures.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] getting WriteXLS to work or else choosing file encoding
 of csv files output from R
Message-ID: <F61D6687-C812-471B-9D5F-1F4BEF7DF832@globetrotter.net>

Hi,

Until now, I have always been happy to export dataframes using write.csv2. The only drawback was than they often include accented vowels and Excel on Mac seems to ONLY be able to properly understand MacRoman encoding. So I used OpenOffice instead to open them. 

But for the next little while, colleagues using Windows and who do not have a clue about encoding (and who do not want to know about encoding) need to use my files. My files will have to be in ISOLATIN1 encoding. It is unfortunate that the write.table family of functions does not have a FileEncoding option like the read.table function family.

I thought I'd get away by saving into Excel files instead of csv. I successfully created Excel files using write.xlsx from xlsx package, but this created "monster" files that were in Excel format, opened in Excel, but all accented vowels came out wrong.

I found another package, WriteXLS  that has an encoding option for its WriteXLS function. It does not work on my Mac (running 10.6.5). The provided testPerl() function confirmed what the authors states in the INSTALL file I got with the package:

"Text::CSV_XS seems to be the one most likely to require separate installation, again, with the
exception of ActiveState Perl, as noted above. Thus, in most cases, this may be the only Perl
module that you will need to install beyond what is already provided in your Perl installation
and the WriteXLS package. "

testPerl()
Perl found.

The following Perl modules were not found on this system:

Text::CSV_XS

If you have more than one Perl installation, be sure the correct one was used here.

Otherwise, please install the missing modules. See the package INSTALL file for more information.


In the INSTALL file, instructions for Mac OS X are:
"

Once the tools are installed, you can then install any missing Perl modules by using the command line in a Terminal
such as:

  [sudo -H] cpan -i Text::CSV_XS

The 'sudo -H' is optional. It is required if you want to install the additional modules for yourself and other users 
of the Mac. Otherwise, if you just want to perform a 'local' install for yourself, it is not required."

The tools he refers to are the Developer's tools, which I have (though I did not do anything to keep them "up to date"). But running the above command resulted in this:

sudo -H cpan -i Text::CSV_XS

Is there another solution, such as easily (inside my R scripts) temporarily getting R to output csv files  in isolatin1?

Hi Denis,

Sorry that you are having issues with WriteXLS.  If my recollection is at all correct, I believe that the solution is to re-install XCode Tools on your system. The YAML related warnings are ignorable, but the other errors suggest problems with the XCode Tools install on your system. I would be sure to download the latest version of XCode Tools from:

  http://developer.apple.com/technologies/xcode.html

Note that the latest version of XCode is 3.2.5 and includes both OSX and iOS tools packaged together and weighs in at 3.5 Gb...it took around 35 minutes to download over my network connection here.

Let me know if that does not does not help you.

Regards,

Marc Schwartz

Most likely CP1252, which is the encoding used on Windows in W. 
European languages, not-quite-a-superset of latin1. (This is all in 
the R manuals, BTW.)

But that's just syntactic sugar.

     file: either a character string naming a file or a connection open
           for writing.  ?""? indicates output to the console.

See ?file for how to specify the encoding of a connection.  Very 
likely you want

con <- file('filename', open="w", encoding = "latin1")

(or "macroman": see ?iconvlist to find encoding names on your OS).

This works well for me for dataframe "test":

con <- file("test.csv", open="w", encoding = "LATIN1")
write.csv(test, con, row.names=F)
close(con)

I hesitated to use close() because this suggested it would be closed automatically:
"open opens a connection. In general functions using connections will open them if they are not open, but then close them again, so to leave a connection open call open explicitly."

But I quickly discovered I had to close manually.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] getting WriteXLS to work or else choosing file
 encoding of csv files output from R

Following Marc's suggestion, I installed the latest Developer's tools and was then able to install the missing Perl script from Terminal, as verified from within R by:

testPerl()
Perl found.

All required Perl modules were found.

I can now use WriteXLS when needed. Thanks Marc.

Dear R and Mac friend,

I am rather impressed by R, but dont know if it is worthwile to spend  
time learning it, if the Mac version is not comprehensive enough. I am  
a PhD student in macroeconometrics, with focus on time-series.

Would you recommend me to use R in that case? And which material and  
packages would you recommend to go trough and download?


Sincere regards
Deniz

I wouldn't worry about the quality of the Mac version of R. It just works.
It is more than excellent. 
The GUI R.app is easy and fun to use.
Commandline R works just fine.
32-bit and 64-bit version.
All thanks to the work of Simon Urbanek.

And there is a brilliant interface to R for the TextMate editor.

> Would you recommend me to use R in that case? And which material and packages would you recommend to go trough and download?

Goto CRAN and download the installer package for Mac OS X: R-2.12.0.pkg
If you haven't worked with R before, you should look at the Rintro manual.
Goto CRAN and click on Manuals; you'll be taken to the page with an overview of R documentation.

For further packages you can have a look at Task Views (also on CRAN). Have a look at the TimeSeries view.

Enjoy.

The power of R is virtually unmatched, and R for Mac works extremely well. 

The learning curve is steep, however, and documentation is difficult to grasp, even though it is abundantly available. I am more partial to a commercial data analysis package with which I grew up, but I have done enough work with R on the mac platform to recommend it highly.

With the caveat that it takes some time to learn. Once you have learned the language, however, you are truly not limited in any way in what you can do.

Install R and search the packages library for any packages that specifically address your needs. If they exist, start learning!

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] html help and browser vs. Rgui
Message-ID: <4D015DF5.2010004@witthoft.com>

I have two separate questions about help windows.

First:  I'm running R2.12 at home under 10.5.8, and at work under 10.6.4 
(Intel iMacs in both cases).

At home, when I invoke help, e.g.,
  >  ?sin ,
I get the help page in the Rgui help window (and my web browser is not 
called).

But at work, the Rgui help window opens, remains blank, and the sin help 
page shows up in my default web browser.

Is there a way I can either force my work machine to use the Rgui 
window, or at the least stop the useless help window from opening up?

Am I able to use the Rgui help window at home just thru some luck of 
pre-existing conditions (from the  R 2.8 or 2.9 days)?

I checked, and the Library/Frameworks/.../base/R/Rprofile files are the 
same on both machines, as are my personal   .Rprofile and .Renvir files 
in my home directory.


Second: I noticed that on both machines, when I use the Search bar in 
the document editor window (Rgui editor window),  the little pop-up 
results panel displays the help page, with properly functioning links to 
referenced help pages.  This suggests the help system is working "behind 
the scenes" somehow on my work machine, even though it fails to access 
the Rgui Help window.    Anything I can do to adjust this?


Many thanks for your help.


Carl

The default is what you see at home - and that is the intended behavior.

There is a preference "use.external.help" that allows you to use an external browser (at the request of some users) - you can enable it using (in Terminal):
defaults write org.R-project.R use.external.help YES

and disable it using
defaults delete org.R-project.R use.external.help 

So chances are that you enabled it at some point in the past (maybe?) - it's definitely NOT the default.

Alternatively (if that's not the issue?) it may be some strange setting of your browser - but you'd have to provide more detains on that (e.g. do you use a custom browser instead of Safari which may be forcing that behavior?).

Cheers,
Simon

Thanks, Simon.
I'll check out the current settings in my work machine's
org.R-project.R.plist file next week (we have Friday off. Yay!).

Carl
PS I use Firefox both at home and at work as my default, so I *hope* 
that's not the issue.

Next to "begging the question,"  the phrase "steep learning curve" is
probably the most misused cliche out there.

A 'learning curve' represents knowledge (or understanding) as a function 
of time.  THerefore,  the steeper the better.
Please help save the English language from descent into Humpty-Dumpty 
land, and train your colleagues in the correct usage of both these terms.

I agree with you completely about ``begging the question''.  The
nearly universal misuse of this expression drives me crazy.  I'm
not so sure about ``steep learning curve'' however.  My impression
is that this phrase has *always* been used to convey the idea that
a subject area is difficult to learn, whence to use it (as you suggest)
in the sense that the subject area can be learned quickly would be to
change the original meaning of the phrase.  That would be undesirable,
even given that the original meaning is counter-intuitive.

I recall having heard/read a ``justification'' for the original meaning
to the effect that what is envisaged is plotting effort expended on
the *y* axis and knowledge level on the *x* axis.  Thus a steep learning
curve would entail expending a great deal of effort for a small increase
in knowledge.

I agree that this is a silly choice of axes --- I certainly wouldn't make
such a choice.  But I don't suppose that there's any law against it.

	cheers,

As Carl said, a learning curve plots performance (knowledge) as a 
function of time, at least that is how it has been used in psychology 
and the learning sciences for a hundred years. So a "steep" learning 
curve implies "easy to learn" .... but the metaphor of being "steep" = 
"hard to climb" = "difficult" seems to be intuitively compelling for 
many people, so I gave up on correcting people on the wrong use of 
"steep learning curve" ;-)

Shouldn't that be "quick to learn"?

My own experience with R would suggest that easy and quick are not
always synonymous (eureka moment). I tend to think the R learning
curve qualifies as steep because it elevates you rapidly, if you are
able to rise with it, and also because it can be difficult to follow.

Just my two cents,

baptiste

There are many levels of knowledge/skills of R, the first levels are quick to do. But next levels are harder to pass.

I will say in a sentence that R is easy to learn but difficult to master, which applies to many things (danse, music, sport, ...)!

See  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_curve

Surely what is envisaged is the sheer effort involved in climbing
a step mountain side.  It does not have a graph in mind.  If one 
wants to change the metaphor and turn it into a graph, it is not 
at all obvious what the horizontal axis ought to be, though 
various rather strained interpretations can be proposed.  

There is a further aspect to the metaphor that deserves attention.
The reward for negotiating the steep learning curve is to reach
a great height, where marvellous vistas spread out before the
climber!

I share with Carl about the misuse of the term learning curve.

The original derivation was from learning theory where one plotted 
number of correct responses on the y axis against trial number on the 
x axis.  Steep learning curves thus implied rapid learning (of easy 
material).  Flat learning curves implied slow learning (of difficult 
material).

When I complain about this misuse of the term to my psychological 
colleagues, they smile, agree with me that their usage was incorrect, 
and then suggest I go back to worrying about how to code things in R.

When I teach R, I suggest that yes, the learning curve is steep, 
smile and then point out that therefore it is easy to learn. 
Realistically, as is true of learning any skill, the curve is 
negatively accelerated with asymptotic learning achieved only by the 
wizards of Core R.

Ah! That is interesting!

For me, the learning curve is like the energy required for a chemical or 
a biochemical reaction to occur. Thus, on the X-axis, you could have the 
amount of R learned/assimilated, and on the Y-axis, you have the 
energy/effort/time (or whatever measure of learning effort you like to 
use). Thus, a steep learning curve means you have to provide a lot of 
effort to reach a little bit of learning. A flatter learning curve 
allows you to progress faster with little effort (like running on a flat 
ground versus climbing a mountain, to reuse John's metaphor).

Still with the (bio)chemical reaction analogy in mind, anything that 
makes R more "digest" (a good tutorial, a good GUI, etc.) is like an 
enzyme that allows for the (bio)chemical reaction to occur with less energy.

Otherwise, I am always amazed that people could use a metaphor like 
here, a reference to the shape of a curve on a graph, without even 
knowing what exactly are the X- and Y-axes. Shame on us!
Best,

Philippe

Nothing to be ashamed of: We all know what is steep even if we cannot graph
it. 

I just wonder why the other supposed "misuse" was completely ignored in this
thread: there are many things in R that are "begging the question" but
nobody dares to ask.

And of course the inverse of a flat curve (assuming it is an invertible
function) always is a steep curve.
So steepness or flatness depends on your choice of axes.
If you plot "amount to be learned" on the x-axis
and "time needed" on the y-axis, you also get a steep curve.

The phrase ``to beg the question'' means to indulge in circular reasoning;
to assume what is to be proven.  Unfortunately that meaning is becoming lost
in the wilderness of ignorance that surrounds us, and the phrase is almost
universally used to mean ``to raise the question'' or ``to evince the necessity
of an answer to the question''.  The language thus loses subtlety and nuance,
and Newspeak takes over and limits our ability to express our thoughts.  And
that is doubleplus ungood! :-)

There seems to have been quite a lot of gnashing of teeth

issh on my iphone4 and found it capable of running R remotely -- complete
with forwarded x11 graphics, I've been wondering what all
the fuss was about.  Granted one would have to be rather
desperate to do anything very elaborate on the iphone, but
it would seem much more likely to be useful when invoking
an R session on a remote machine that you already were familiar
with than running de novo on the phone itself.  Setup was quite easy
once you are able to login to a remote machine, you need only to
enable x forwarding, and the dwm window manager and 
then invoking a plot command sends graphics that are viewable
by tapping the X symbol in the upper right corner of the screen
(twice).

Roger,

The main issue in the prior discussions was not running R remotely, but actually having an R application on the iPhone or iPad, the latter certainly being more suitable to productivity with R.

A stand-alone R application would not be possible under the current restrictions put in place by Apple, as discussed extensively in the past.

However, a remote SSH model, such as you describe, or using a client/server model via a GUI based application on the iPhone or iPad that submitted code to a remote server and returned text/graphical results (such as Wolfram|Alpha, see http://products.wolframalpha.com/iphone/), is certainly possible.

Regards,

Marc Schwartz

Not that - you could run remote sessions from the iPhone for years (there are many ways, ssh+X11, VNC, remote R GUIs, ...) we know that ;). The discussion you refer to (I guess) was about native R which is possible (we have arm support in the framework) but not distributable via Apple Store. I would still argue that it would be nice to have remote version of the R.app for the iPad but given all the other available options it's not a high priority.

Cheers,
Simon

Apparently your X11 is out of date - try installing all security upgrades from Apple (see Software Update).

That said, on Mac you are usually better off using Quartz - e.g. quartz(.., type="jpeg") instead of jpeg(), png() etc..

And the correct version should have been a part of the 10.5.8 system update:

hagal:~$ pkgutil --file-info /usr/X11/lib/libfontconfig.dylib 
volume: /
path: usr/X11/lib/libfontconfig.dylib

pkgid: com.apple.pkg.X11User
pkg-version: 10.5.3.1.1.1191932192

pkgid: com.apple.pkg.update.os.10.5.8.combo
pkg-version: 1.0.1.1191932192
install-time: 1271181602

so if in doubt, try re-installing the 10.5.8 update:

Thank you all for your reply and comments. I have actually come to  
like R a lot already. Yes, it takes some time to learn, especially  
since I am not used to programmming language.

Respect to all involved!!!

I use barebones.com's BBEdit 
so I have reminders and menu selections for converting 
to various character representations, hand editing spots,
 fixing line endings and 
Taking a quick look at data to work out strategies to use 
BASH, C, scripts or what 
have you to beat into shape. If $12?.00 USD is too 
much there is a free editor, Texwrangler.

They won't do anything you can't do other ways 
but they save this old mind time.

Message-ID: <252AF0B8-DFAE-4DB6-BA05-DF695019DF80@xs4all.nl>


I currently use Xcode 3.2.2 and gfortran-42-5659.pkg (obtained from the http://r.research.att.com/tools/ page) on Snow Leopard 10.6.5.

I would like to know if I can use the  gfortran from gfortran-42-5664.pkg (integrated with Xcode 3.2.3) with the recently released Xcode 3.2.5?
I'm asking since Software Update suggests updating Xcode, which is preferable to a direct dowload of 3.2.5 because of the size of a full download.

Apple has made no changes to the gcc since Xcode 3.2.3 (it's still at build 5664) so after updating to Xcode 3.2.5 you can use gfortran-42-5664.pkg to install the appropriate GNU Fortran version which is suitable for any of Xcode 3.2.3, 3.2.4 and 3.2.5.

Cheers,
