Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Warnings installing from source
Message-ID: <c65591a7-6b33-dac4-2620-1ec23eb3af0f@ehar.se>

When running

R CMD INSTALL xxx.tar.gz

I get a lot of warnings, the first being

ld: warning: -undefined dynamic_lookup may not work with chained fixups

followed by several of the type

ld: warning: could not create compact unwind for _yyy_: registers 72 and 
73 not saved contiguously in frame

where 'yyy' stands for names of fortran functions/subroutines in the 
package xxx.

I have installed the usual tools, including gfortran, from
https://mac.r-project.org/tools/

The C compiler is clang (14.0.0), for reasons I have forgotten.

However, the package loads an runs as usual(?), so I wonder what I 
should do about it? Nothing?  But what do the warnings mean?

Thanks, G?ran

PS. No warnings on Ubuntu.

G?ran,

you can ignore the Fortran warnings, the ones you listed are not related to the code.

As for "undefined dynamic_lookup may not work with chained fixups" the easiest is to run
export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=11.0
before you compile your package. Alternatively you can add -Wl,-no_fixup_chains to LDFLAGS.

Cheers,
Simon

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Change to BLAS (from default to Apple vecLib) doesn't
 report in sessionInfo()
Message-ID: <CAC=L8uxTDYvE=-ngd1piuK7GDzVkHmu5mxxxwjKXaK9X3iBR7g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

First post, and my apologies if this was addressed already elsewhere, but
did not seem so to me. This post is (I think) purely about the
behavior of sessionInfo()
after I switch the BLAS to Apple's Accelerate vecLib.

I installed R 4.2.2 on macOS Monterey 12.6.2 (with an M1 chip)
successfully. I run sessionInfo() with the following result:

R version 4.2.2 (2022-10-31)

Platform: aarch64-apple-darwin20 (64-bit)

Running under: macOS Monterey 12.6.2



Matrix products: default

BLAS:
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.2-arm64/Resources/lib/libRblas.0.dylib

LAPACK:
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.2-arm64/Resources/lib/libRlapack.dylib



locale:

[1] en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/C/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8



attached base packages:

[1] stats     graphics  grDevices utils     datasets  methods   base



loaded via a namespace (and not attached):

[1] compiler_4.2.2

And then I run a small piece of test code (taken from somewhere, sorry,
can't recall where):

N <- 20000
M <- 2000
X <- matrix(rnorm(N*M),N)
system.time(crossprod(X))

with result

> system.time(crossprod(X))
user  system  elapsed
49.471  0.082  49.553

Then I change my BLAS (using the vecLib supplied as part of the R
installation package), e.g., in the Terminal app:

cd /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/lib
ln -sf libRblas.vecLib.dylib libRblas.dylib

Afterwards, I restart R. Re-running the small piece of test code above
yields

> system.time(crossprod(X))
user  system  elapsed
0.339  0.015  0.197

which suggests to me that the switch to vecLib did, indeed, succeed.

However, sessionInfo() does something unexpected -- it no longer reports
anything for the BLAS row:

R version 4.2.2 (2022-10-31)

Platform: aarch64-apple-darwin20 (64-bit)

Running under: macOS Monterey 12.6.2



Matrix products: default

LAPACK:
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.2-arm64/Resources/lib/libRlapack.dylib



locale:

[1] en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/C/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8



attached base packages:

[1] stats     graphics  grDevices utils     datasets  methods   base



loaded via a namespace (and not attached):

[1] compiler_4.2.2

Anyone have any leads on whether a) this is a problem, and b) how to fix it
(if so)? Seems this has been the case at least for a couple of years, at
least based on an only tangentially related past thread (link here
<https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-mac/2020-November/013794.html>) where
the responder implicitly shows the same thing -- faster matrix
multiplication, but not reporting of BLAS in sessionInfo().

Thanks,
David

I experienced the same thing. I switched to libRblas.vecLib.dylib and got
the remarkable speedup
in matrix multiplication, but sessionInfo doersn't show that I'm using it.

My suspicion is the code here:

https://github.com/wch/r-source/blob/068a6a0d9d60b1ce42abc879900038649f4a929c/src/main/platform.c#L3358-L3363

It seems that the call to 'realpath()' fails on the path reported via
.dli_fname here, which (for me) is:

/System/Library/Frameworks/Accelerate.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/vecLib.framework/Versions/A/libBLAS.dylib

And indeed, the library does not appear to exist at that location. I'm
not sure if this is a real macOS bug or some property of how vecLib /
macOS frameworks work, though.

For posterity, I'm on macOS Ventura 13.1, running on an M1 macOS machine.

> sessionInfo()
R version 4.2.1 (2022-06-23)
Platform: aarch64-apple-darwin20 (64-bit)
Running under: macOS Ventura 13.1

Matrix products: default
LAPACK: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.2-arm64/Resources/lib/libRlapack.dylib

tl;dr: perhaps R should allow for failures in 'realpath()' above, at
least on macOS, and report the library path as gleaned directly from
dladdr()?

Thanks,
Kevin

This is a feature of macOS since Big Sur 11.0.1, it has a dynamic-linker 
cache of system libraries. The dynamic linker knows how to get the files 
from the cache, but one cannot see them using regular file-based 
utilities such as realpath. Yes, I think we can fall back to the 
argument of realpath() when it returns ENOENT (but we know the library 
should exist as we got it from the dynamic linker).

More here: 
https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos-release-notes/macos-big-sur-11_0_1-release-notes

I can reproduce the problem on my system. Now, what is interesting is 
that when R is rebuilt after the libraries have already been installed 
(e.g. when I use an uninstalled version of R linking to 
libRblas.vecLib.dylib from an installed R-devel snapshot build), the 
linker in the detection code reports:

/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.3-arm64/Resources/lib/libRblas.vecLib.dylib

which works fine with realpath(). But, when R is not re-built after the 
library is re-installed, I see what has been reported. It is not clear 
to me why the difference and possibly it means that, after the fix, 
users would see a bit unpredictably one from these:

BLAS: 
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.3-arm64/Resources/lib/libRblas.vecLib.dylib
BLAS: 
/System/Library/Frameworks/Accelerate.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/vecLib.framework/Versions/A/libBLAS.dylib

but that is still an improvement of what we get now and my intention was 
that the detection code output would be interpreted by a human, anyway.

Subject: netCDF driver missing from package terra 1.6.7 for Mac
Package terra 1.6.7 for Mac (x86_64 version) does not have the netCDF driver.
I have checked with Robert Hijmans who confirms that this important driver is present in the Windows build, but missing from the Mac build.

Could the package be built again to include the netCDF driver?

Many thanks,

I updated to Ventura and this problem of quartz freezing R went away.
Quartz now works without glitch.

My guess, unverified, is that I inadvertently set some environment variable and that
updating the operating system restored an original value.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Nightly builds for macOS Intel not available from
 https://mac.r-project.org/?
Message-ID: <CAB6GOe7OM_sw_afBZyBSTx_OJ-GfXh05k0-80rVu0u9=FT6CmA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I haven't found a .pkg file (or tar.gz) for Intel Macs for
R-4.2-branch or R-devel when I've looked over the last few days.
I first noticed this sometime last week (can't remember exactly when,
sorry), and have checked intermittently since but to no avail.
The corresponding files for arm64 Macs are available.

Am I missing where I can download R-devel for an Intel mac (ideally,
the .pkg version) or perhaps has something gone wrong with the
packaging or upload?

Thanks,
Pete

Thanks, Uwe, but it's R-devel I'm particularly interested in (for
testing packages in BioC-devel), which isn't available from
https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/.
Previously I think I've downloaded this from under 'Nightly builds for
macOS' on https://mac.r-project.org/

Cheers,
Pete

Peter,

see the "last-success" section in the https://mac.r-project.org/ page which links to
https://mac.r-project.org/high-sierra/last-success/
The main page only has a download link if the build was successful, but the above will retained the last successful build when if there is a problem with the current build (which is something I have to look into).

Cheers,
Simon

Thank you, Simon.
I hadn't before seen the 'last-success' section, very helpful.

Hi Travis:

I think for anyone to be able to help,  you need to provide the OS version you are running,  on which hardware  (Intel or Apple),  which link you used to download the installer,  and the exact error message you get.

Thanks,

-Roy

Travis,

quoting Roy?s previous message:

'I think for anyone to be able to help,  you need to provide the OS version you are running,  on which hardware  (Intel or Apple),  which link you used to download the installer,?

Hello Travis,

Just a quick suggestion, from the screenshot it can be seen the installer
is intended for the ARM architecture of MacOS.
Do you have an M1 Apple or an Intel Apply computer? There are different
installers for these two architectures.

Hope this helps,
Adrian

Then I don't know.
If you really are in a big hurry, try installing R into a virtual machine.

I don't have an ARM computer to test, but as far as I know you could also
install Rosetta to allow installers for Intel based architecture.

One of these solutions should work out until the installation problem is
resolved.
Best,
Adrian

Yes, that has been very widely tested.  We don't know what OS you or the 
OP are running, though.

Machines with M2 CPUs are very new (like 1-2 days old) and are 
presumably running 13.1 or 13.2.

I have just re-installed 4.2.2 on Macs running Ventura 13.2 with M1 Pro 
and M1 Mac CPUs.  If I had a failure my first step would be to look at 
the Console logs (the Console App is under Applications/Utilities).  And 
I would make sure my OS was up-to-date (13.2 is also new this week).

To the best of my understanding, in life nothing works just because one tries to do it multiple times ? conditions must change for success to come from failure.  Because computers especially do not change their settings based on multiple previous failed attempts to install a software, you must have changed something for the installation to work.  

We cannot say anything about this instance, but anybody with the same problem is well advised to provide a full information of what is going on, so we can help.  Also, a methodical approach in testing different things (different CRAN mirror download, different security settings, whatever) would help.

Hi,

I?ve been having issues downloading R and it is required for my statistics class. I have a macbook air with an M1 and it?s on Ventura. I followed the steps on the website to download R-4.2.2-arm64.pkg but everytime I get this error message:

Emily,

first, R may already be installed - check your Application folder.

If that is not the case, restart your computer. Only then try the installation again.

If you get an error again, go to Window in the top menu and select "Installer Log". This will pop up a window on the bottom. There in the top left select "Show All Logs" and then click on "Save" in the top right corner. Save the log and post it here.

Thanks,
Simon
