I still have theses same problems with R. I have not run into the LaTex issues yet.  The only solution that allows me to continue to work in R is to open R and open any scripts using XQuartz. I also must delete the R saved state every time it is generated. 

I am hopeful that someone will find a permanent solution.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Mac-only problem using readOGR(), which uses ogrInfo(),
 to read a shapefile from a directory on a USB pen drive
Message-ID: <4EA849F6-23B0-4351-A98E-187D3D9111D2@cornell.edu>

I ran across a Mac-only problem using readOGR(), which uses ogrInfo(), to read a shapefile from a directory on a USB pen drive. I tested the behaviour on a Windows 10 machine and did not get the problem. 

Trying to read from the USB drive, with relative and full paths:

> setwd("/Volumes/ISPRS/?) # this is my connected USB drive
> list.files()     
 [1] "map7100.dbf"                      "map7100.prj"                     
 [3] "map7100.sbn"                      "map7100.sbx"                     
[5] "map7100.shp"                      "map7100.shp.xml"                 
[7] "map7100.shx"  
> file.exists("map7100.shp")
[1] TRUE
> usa <- readOGR(dsn=".", layer="map7100")
Error in ogrInfo(dsn = dsn, layer = layer, encoding = encoding, use_iconv = use_iconv,  : 
  Cannot open data source
> usa <- readOGR(dsn="/Volumes/ISPRS", layer="map7100")
Error in ogrInfo(dsn = dsn, layer = layer, encoding = encoding, use_iconv = use_iconv,  : 
  Cannot open data source

But, readOGR reads the shapefile correctly if it?s located on the Mac?s internal drive:

> setwd("/Users/rossiter/data/edu/dgeostats/ex")
> file.exists("./ds/NEweather/map7100.shp")
[1] TRUE
> usa <- readOGR(dsn="./ds/NEweather", layer="map7100")
OGR data source with driver: ESRI Shapefile 
Source: "./ds/NEweather", layer: "map7100"
with 7926 features
It has 19 fields

All packages are up to date. Here is the sessionInfo():

Anyone have any luck with figuring this out? I have the same problem on 
both my personal and work computers immediately after installing Sierra.

I'm not sure if it's related, but LaTeX has also been giving me issues ever 
since I installed Sierra on my personal machine.

I'm close to completely wiping my personal machine to try to fix the R and 
LaTeX issues. If I do, I'll report back on if it fixes the issue.

Thanks,
David

I?ve had no trouble with using RStudio so it is definitely a GUI problem. I?ve also had no trouble with TeXShop so I assume that whatever LaTex editor you are using is the problem.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Mac-only problem using readOGR(),

 to read a shapefile from a directory on a USB pen drive

My thought is that it might be that USB drives are usually MSDOS formatted. Generally not a problem but maybe a problem because rgdal works with directories. Formatting  in a Mac with Disk Utility might be a work-around, with the limitation that the USB will only work in Macs.

I would also try verbose=TRUE which may give more information.

In the absence of other ideas contacting the package maintainer may help.

Thanks to Ken Beath, this indeed was the problem. I tested by formatting a USB drive to Mac format with Disk Info, copying the shapefiles onto it, and then reading with readOGR().

Problem solved, although the Mac-formatted USB drive could not be used to transfer files to and from Windows machines.

But, readOGR reads the shapefile correctly if it?s located on the Mac?s internal drive:

I reinstalled macOS yesterday as well as R and MacTeX, and everything is 
working again!
Killed half a day, but I'm excited to have things back :)
The reinstallation instructions I followed are at
https://support.apple.com/kb/PH25649?locale=en_US

*I'm curious what machines others who are encountering issues are using.* 
Here are the two machines where I encountered problems:

   - My personal machine: Macbook Pro Retina Mid 2014 (13-inch). Fixed 
   after macOS Sierra reinstall!
   - My work machine: Macbook Pro Retina Mid 2014 (15-inch). I haven't 
   tried reinstalling macOS Sierra on this machine.
   

My suspicion at this point is that the macOS Sierra update is at fault:

   - Reinstalling programs before the full macOS reinstall did not fix the 
   problems.
   - Going nuclear and reinstalling macOS, then reinstalling the same 
   programs did solve the problems.
   - I have not changed any of the files I was using or changed what 
   programs I use.


For the record, here are the exact programs where I was running into issues:

   - Regular R installation and R GUI from CRAN. I ran into problems when 
   I'd open an .R text file when R was not already open.
   - MacTeX installation and the TeXShop editor. The errors I encountered 
   were when using BIbTeX in particular -- typesetting using BibTeX worked 
   fine, but the files it generated would cause a failure when going back to 
   the regular LaTeX typesetting.

Given that none of my colleagues seem to have been hit with the issue, 
guessing that only a small minority of machines are affected.

I reinstalled macOS yesterday as well as R and MacTeX, and everything is 
working again!
Killed half a day, but I'm excited to have things back :)
The reinstallation instructions I followed are at
https://support.apple.com/kb/PH25649?locale=en_US

*I'm curious what machines others who are encountering issues are using.* 
Here are the two machines where I encountered problems:

   - My personal machine: Macbook Pro Retina Mid 2014 (13-inch). Fixed 
   after macOS Sierra reinstall!
   - My work machine: Macbook Pro Retina Mid 2014 (15-inch). I haven't 
   tried reinstalling macOS Sierra on this machine.
   

My suspicion at this point is that the macOS Sierra update is at fault:

   - Reinstalling programs before the full macOS reinstall did not fix the 
   problems.
   - Going nuclear and reinstalling macOS, then reinstalling the same 
   programs did solve the problems.
   - I have not changed any of the files I was using or changed what 
   programs I use.


For the record, here are the exact programs where I was running into issues:

   - Regular R installation and R GUI from CRAN. I ran into problems when 
   I'd open an .R text file when R was not already open.
   - MacTeX installation and the TeXShop editor. The errors I encountered 
   were when using BIbTeX in particular -- typesetting using BibTeX worked 
   fine, but the files it generated would cause a failure when going back to 
   the regular LaTeX typesetting.

Given that none of my colleagues seem to have been hit with the issue, 
guessing that only a small minority of machines are affected.

Message-ID: <CACgVrFcVxA5H2+EZZHZ9=Za=9MOXXuZKUCvrA=nOrMDFeCSvyA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi - In an off-list e-mail exchange David Diez suggested that the little
bash function I put together might be useful for others.  This isn't a
'fix,' just a way to simplify getting R running again.  From David's
experience it sounds like the only real fix available now is to completely
erase your hard drive and re-install Sierra, R, etc.

My problems with R generally occur when I attempt to open an existing file
when working in R.  I use "standard" R with the R GUI from CRAN.  Instead
of seeing the list of available files, an empty window appears along with
the dreaded spinning beach ball.  At this point I have to go to the Finder
and force R to quit.

I added the following function to my .bashrc file:

function fixRhang()
{
 cd ~/Library/Saved\ Application\ State
rm -R org.R-project.R.savedState/
cd
rm .Rhistory
}

After I force R to quit, I open an XQuartz window, and just enter

bash-3.2$ fixRhang

At this point, I can open R again and continue working (though obviously
the command history is empty).

I'm sure that there are better (or more efficient) ways of accomplishing
this, but it works for me.

It would be informative to try ogrInfo from the shell prompt (i.e., outside of R) to find out if this is an R problem or an ogrInfo problem.

    My thought is that it might be that USB drives are usually MSDOS formatted. Usually not a problem but rgdal works with directories. Formatting  in a Mac with Disk Utility might be a work-around, with the limitation that the USB will only work in Macs.
    
    I would also try verbose=TRUE which may give more information.
    
    In the absence of other ideas contacting the package author can help.

Good idea. From the shell, ogrInfo correctly reads the shapefile:

$ ogrInfo /Volumes/DRENTHE/ds/NEweather/ gdd50_7100j | more
INFO: Open of `/Volumes/DRENTHE/ds/NEweather/'
      using driver `ESRI Shapefile' successful.

Layer name: gdd50_7100j
Geometry: Point
Feature Count: 5556
Extent: (-177.350000, -14.330000) - (174.100000, 71.280000)
Layer SRS WKT:
GEOGCS["GCS_North_American_1927",
    DATUM["North_American_Datum_1927",
        SPHEROID["Clarke_1866",6378206.4,294.9786982]],
    PRIMEM["Greenwich",0.0],
    UNIT["Degree",0.0174532925199433]]
STATION_ID: Integer (6.0)
STATE: String (2.0)
STATION_NA: String (24.0)

etc.

This is indeed an MS-DOS USB device (which came from a meeting at the Drenthe (NL) provincial enviromental bureau, hence the volume name):

$ mount | grep DRENTHE
/dev/disk3s1 on /Volumes/DRENTHE (msdos, local, nodev, nosuid, noowners)

From R comes the failure with readOGR:

> usa <- readOGR(dsn="/Volumes/DRENTHE/ds/NEweather/", layer=?gdd50_7100?)
Error in ogrInfo(dsn = dsn, layer = layer, encoding = encoding, use_iconv = use_iconv,  : 
  Cannot open data source

In that case I'm surprised. R is generally pretty solid about interactions with the OS. I may try to reproduce this on my Mac, though probably not today or tomorrow. If I have the same failure, the next step will probably be to contact the rgdal author(s).

    This is indeed an MS-DOS USB device (which came from a meeting at the Drenthe (NL) provincial enviromental bureau, hence the volume name):
    
    $ mount | grep DRENTHE
    /dev/disk3s1 on /Volumes/DRENTHE (msdos, local, nodev, nosuid, noowners)
    
    From R comes the failure with readOGR:

    Error in ogrInfo(dsn = dsn, layer = layer, encoding = encoding, use_iconv = use_iconv,  :

Barry,

thanks to your crash report I think that particular issue should be hopefully fixed (it took me a while to reproduce as you need a big-enough script open so it changes the margins plus you need to have doc restore enabled). Please try out R 3.3.3 (if CRAN is not synced yet you can use http://r.research.att.com/bin/macosx/R-3.3.3.pkg directly) - make sure is says "R.app GUI 1.69 (7328)".

Thanks,
Simon

Paul,

one issue is that you have a saved workspace that causes R to crash - move it away (/users/PJO/.RData) - see R for Mac FAQ 10.11 "R.app GUI crashes on startup!". Second issue was a crash on macOS Sierra when restoring R documents as startup that was fixed in R 3.3.3.

Cheers,
Simon

R 3.4.0 (currently R-devel) will be built on some more recent macOS and possibly different compilers - the details are currently under discussion and TBD.

Message-ID: <8664BBA4-DA4B-4A01-A865-7D57794A90F0@stat.ucla.edu>

Not sure of this has already been discussed. There is now a libpcre
sitting in /usr/lib (OS X 10.12.4) and R-devel does not like
that version. So I had to use LDFLAGS to link with the pcre from 
homebrew if I wanted the build to finish.

OS X / macOS has had pcre 8.02 for years, and R has required at least 
8.12 for years.  (opensource.apple.com is currently broken, so I cannot 
check how many years.)

If all else fails, read the manual (?C.3):

'Those and other binary components are available from 
https://r.research.att.com/libs: you will need pcre and xz (for libzma) 
as recent macOS versions provide libraries but not headers for these 
(and the system pcre is too old at version 8.02).'

That build of pcre 8.36 is static, and so avoids any problems with 
dynamic load paths.  It is trivial to build later versions (statically) 
from the PCRE sources for yourself.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] Problem updating packages
Message-ID: <D7BA4BEE-C18B-4C47-8607-024247CA638B@gmail.com>


In MacOS 10.12.3 (Sierra), I can't update packages (though it worked on the same computer in MacOS 10.11):

update.packages( 
     lib  = lib <- .libPaths()[1],
     pkgs = as.data.frame(installed.packages(lib), stringsAsFactors=FALSE)$Package,
     type = 'source')

Warning: unable to access index for repository https://cloud.r-project.org/src/contrib:
  cannot open the connection
Warning message:
In read.dcf(file = tmpf) :
  cannot open compressed file '/tmp/RtmpS3f5mS/file959038dcc8eb', probable reason 'No such file or directory'

---

My internet connection works fine; updating hasn't worked since I upgraded MacOS to 10.12 from 10.11.
Confusingly, on a new MacBook Pro with 10.12.3 & R 3.3.3, updating works without error.  It feels as though something changed in the upgrade and now I can't get to where I got before.

I'd appreciate help in resolving this.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] slow compiling times with clang 4.0.0 (but faster code?)
Message-ID: <932a18a9-4594-acee-dd80-64034ee01a54@fredhutch.org>

Hi,

Following the lead of the R folks, we've started to build and check
Bioconductor packages on El Capitan using the compilers that Simon
made available here:

   https://r.research.att.com/libs/

The cran-usr-local-darwin15.6-20170320.tar.gz tarball contains
clang 4.0.0 that is used to compile package C and C++ code.

Our latest daily build report can be found here:

   https://bioconductor.org/checkResults/3.5/bioc-LATEST/

The builder running El Capitan + clang 4.0.0 is veracruz2:

   veracruz2:~ biocbuild$ clang -v
   clang version 4.0.0 (tags/RELEASE_400/final)
   Target: x86_64-apple-darwin15.6.0
   Thread model: posix
   InstalledDir: /usr/local/clang+llvm-4.0.0-x86_64-apple-darwin/bin

toluca2 is another builder that has the same specs than veracruz2
but is running Mavericks and uses the clang compiler from Apple's
Command Line Developer Tools:

   toluca2:~ biocbuild$ clang -v
   Apple LLVM version 6.0 (clang-600.0.57) (based on LLVM 3.5svn)
   Target: x86_64-apple-darwin13.4.0
   Thread model: posix

We're observing significantly slower compiling times on veracruz2
compared to toluca2. For example, looking at packages where
'R CMD INSTALL' time is dominated by compilation:

   683.0 vs 483.6 seconds for the mzR package (C++ code):

 
https://bioconductor.org/checkResults/3.5/bioc-LATEST/mzR/veracruz2-install.html
 
https://bioconductor.org/checkResults/3.5/bioc-LATEST/mzR/toluca2-install.html

   378.3 vs 299.9 seconds for the flowWorkspace package (C++ code):

 
https://bioconductor.org/checkResults/3.5/bioc-LATEST/flowWorkspace/veracruz2-install.html
 
https://bioconductor.org/checkResults/3.5/bioc-LATEST/flowWorkspace/toluca2-install.html

   186.3 vs 126.2 seconds for the rTANDEM package (C++ code):

 
https://bioconductor.org/checkResults/3.5/bioc-LATEST/rTANDEM/veracruz2-install.html
 
https://bioconductor.org/checkResults/3.5/bioc-LATEST/rTANDEM/toluca2-install.html

   109.4 vs 80.8 seconds for the rhdf5 package (C code):

 
https://bioconductor.org/checkResults/3.5/bioc-LATEST/rhdf5/veracruz2-install.html
 
https://bioconductor.org/checkResults/3.5/bioc-LATEST/rhdf5/toluca2-install.html

   etc...

The slowdown seems pretty consistent with a time_on_veracruz2 /
time_on_toluca2 ratio varying between 1.25 and 1.5.

In addition to clang 4.0.0 we also have the clang compiler from
Apple's Command Line Developer Tools on veracruz2:

   veracruz2:sandbox biocbuild$ /usr/bin/clang -v
   Apple LLVM version 8.0.0 (clang-800.0.42.1)
   Target: x86_64-apple-darwin15.6.0
   Thread model: posix
   InstalledDir: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin

If I switch between the 2 compilers on veracruz2 I observe a similar
slowdown i.e. the time_with_clang_4.0.0 / time_with_Apple_clang ratio
is about the same as the previous ratios. The only difference this
time is the compiler.

I was wondering if anybody else observed this or if this a known
"issue" with clang 4.0.0.

On the other hand the good news is that packages with no native
code seem to build and check slightly faster on veracruz2 than on
toluca2. For example:

https://bioconductor.org/checkResults/3.5/bioc-LATEST/GenomicFeatures/veracruz2-buildsrc.html
https://bioconductor.org/checkResults/3.5/bioc-LATEST/GenomicFeatures/toluca2-buildsrc.html

https://bioconductor.org/checkResults/3.5/bioc-LATEST/GenomicFeatures/veracruz2-checksrc.html
https://bioconductor.org/checkResults/3.5/bioc-LATEST/GenomicFeatures/toluca2-checksrc.html

Note that R was compiled with Apple's clang on toluca2 and with clang
4.0.0 on veracruz2. So is the deal that clang 4.0.0 produces more
efficient code at the cost of longer compilation times?

Cheers,
H.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] El Capitan binaries of CRAN packages and R
Message-ID: <c44cd645-0325-4992-ff5c-249b0f9fec22@fredhutch.org>

Hi,

Just wanted to point out 2 things about the new El Capitan binaries
in case they've not been noticed yet.

1) Many of the package binaries on CRAN (e.g. found here
   https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/macosx/el-capitan/contrib/3.4/) are
   currently broken. Most likely because they were generated just
   before the r72375 change in R (announced here
   https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/2017-March/073940.html).

   For example:
      library(e1071)
      example(svm)  # error: object 'R_svmtrain' not found
   or:
      library(rgl)
      rgl.clear()  # error: object 'rgl_clear' not found
   etc...

2) It looks like there has been no successful El Capitan build
   of R since March 21st on the "R for Mac OS X Developer's Page":

     https://r.research.att.com/

Hopefully these issues can be taken care of soon.

Thanks,
H.
