I?m not at the level where I could effectively debug this issue and normally I wouldn?t jump in, but this is a long holiday weekend in the US and it wouldn?t surprise me if Simon didn?t see this for a couple of days.  I would first try deleting R.app from the Applications folder and re-installing it with a clean copy:

http://r.research.att.com/mavericks/R-3.3-branch/R-GUI-7238-3.3-mavericks-Release.dmg <http://r.research.att.com/mavericks/R-3.3-branch/R-GUI-7238-3.3-mavericks-Release.dmg>

I do see  ?debug? versions but I have never seen it suggested that ordinary users deploy those versions as a first step.

I would also delete the .Rdata and the .Rapp.history files from your working directory. They have a record of getting corrupted an causing instabilities of obscure causes. They are ?hidden files? so you either need to ?show them? in the Finder or you need to sue Terminal.app to run a bash session and use mv. This is the first method:

Open Terminal found in Finder > Applications > Utilities
In Terminal, paste the following:          defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES
Press return
Hold the ?Option/alt? key, then right click on the Finder icon in the dock and click Relaunch.
Tor reverse that after deleting those files you would use the same steps with NO substituted for YES. (My preference is for leaving the hidden files shown.)

Best;

? as well as a suggestion from a different source that `sue`-ing the Terminal might not be appropriate.

I did wonder about using YES rather than TRUE. That was copied from a google hit.  ISTR that in the past I used TRUE. Didn?t notice the difference until after posting. I later did a search but failed to find documentation that YES was a bash synonym of TRUE. I now pulled up the $man defaults page and it includes this line:

-bool[ean]  Allows the user to specify a boolean as the value for the
                 given preference key.  Value must be TRUE, FALSE, YES, or NO.

So at least Finder.app won?t be sueing me.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] R dock icon bug, OSX10.11.5,
 upgrade from incomplete uninstall of R3.2 to 3.3.1
Message-ID: <CA+FgvxpYEKBP2C0FVNy3X8d=rRqrE3EF5axh4aDHadQuB85OLA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I ran into a situation where a complete deletion of all R resources
and a fresh install was needed with the upgrade to R 3.3.1. I've found
that despite following the manuals uninstall guidance, it appears
"something" R related is remaining somewhere on the hard drive. The
error presents if I right click the R icon from the Mac dock. The icon
is listing functions long since deleted from hard drive. This suggests
that the uninstall of R3.2 is perhaps incomplete. I can't tell if the
"something" extends a simple representation of old deleted files, or
perhaps there is something going on that's more significant. I've gone
down this path to clear up environment variable issues so I'm eager to
ensure I've removed .

Environment specs:
OSX 10.11.5
R3.3.1

Investigation steps taken: I've through the manuals, rseek.org
searches on this topic but haven't been able to find a solution. Also
pestered people in an R user group locally. 1 person confirmed they
see the same weird behavior on their machine. No details on their
specs however.

Remediation steps attempted:

- Trashed R.app and Rstudio.app, emptied trash
- Followed guidance on
https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-admin.html#Uninstalling-under-OS-X,
ran sudo rm from terminal and visually confirmed directories deleted.
- For some reason the official guide didn't mention directory, found
and manually deleted ~/library/application support/R/
- Icons were still in the dock, manually removed them.
- Unhid files, deleted all .RData, .Rhistory, etc files anywhere found
on harddrive
- Ran from terminal: defaults delete com.apple.dock, then killall Dock
- Arranged Finder "All My Files" view by application, confirmed
garbage .R files indeed weren't on hard drive
- In above step noted .R files associated with Xcode, opened Xcode and
confirmed no recent files displayed by app.
- Deleted all recently opened files by Apple > Recent Items > Clear Menu
- Rebooted and reinstalled R / Rstudio and check what happens, no change.
- Opened R, opened a different .R file. This new .R file is listed if
right clicking the icon but separated from the garbage .Rs file by a
line. Closed the test .R file, garbage still there.
- Created icon from both Launchpad and from ~/Applications/R.app,
garbage there in both methods

With help from David Winsemius, here?s what I tried so far:
	1. Deleting the .Rdata and the .Rapp.history files from my working directory
	2. Reinstalling R
	3. Setting my working directory on startup

Additionally, I have 3 Macs and all of them are having the same problem.

Does anyone have any ideas on fixing this problem?

Thank you for your suggestions.

Message-ID: <CAEWrQ+E7Rn93U_ebibzZueKFzZcMRKAqJyRYz_C_6ELiTiPdxw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I wrote a 76-line script to process 15,000 text files in batches of 1,000.
The script worked wonderfully on R GUI yesterday, but this morning R GUI
wouldn't even start up.
OSX's Activity Monitor indicates that R GUI uses 63GB of memory. That is
probably why OSX paused the app. I tried several methods in the hope of
fixing the problem, including throughly uninstalling R and RStudio using
CleanMyMac, resetting SMC and PRAM. When I re-installed R GUI, the memory
leak (?) is still there. R GUI still occupies 63GB. Can anyone please help?

My laptop: MacBook Pro (Retina, Early 2015) running OSX El Capitan, 3.1GHz
Intel Core i7 with 16GB 1867 MHz DDR3
Many thanks.

Hi, 

The problem is not with R but with an association file somewhere in the
operating system directories - probably in /Libraries, but I forget
where.  What this file does is 'remember' what filetypes are associated
with which applications.  If nobody beats me to it,  I'll try to dig
thru my memories (and AskDifferent, aka apple.stackexchange.com) for the
answer. 

Possible answer at
http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/91522/change-file-association-in-terminal
  : look at ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.LaunchServices.plist

Please consider reading R FAQ 7.42

https://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html#Why-is-R-apparently-not-releasing-memory_003f

You're talking about memory leak in the GUI - does it mean it takes a lot more memory than running it in R directly?

Cheers,
Simon

Julian,

I'm not sure I understand your question - can elaborate on "listing functions long since deleted"? Are you referring to R functions, your code or something like that? Your operation of R will create many artifacts depending on what you do, run and use - none of which is under our control.

As for applications, OS X has no central repository, the presence of an application is enough to get it registered. You can use mdfind to locate all instances of an application, for example to search the R GUI you can use

mdfind "kMDItemCFBundleIdentifier == 'org.R-project.R'"

For the framework you would use

mdfind "kMDItemCFBundleIdentifier == 'org.r-project.R-framework'"

The other thing to consider is the metadata registered which you can check with pkgutil via

pkgutil --pkgs | grep ^org.r-project

Finally, as Carl pointed out, OS X may be caching the the files association - I don't know if there is a way to force dis-asociation or if it will keep it in case you decide to re-install the application.

Cheers,
Simon

The presence of `zoo`, `xts`, and `IBrokers` in that list of non-attached namespaces seems unexplained. It's surely not a part of the standard base installation. `lattice` and `grid` are also not loaded by default so this suggests you have not completely removed all traces from the prior installation. Check to see that there isn't an .Rprofile or .Rdata still in the startup directory. (And delete them if there.)

I actually suggested reinstalling the R.app GUI using the binary installer at:
http://r.research.att.com/mavericks/R-3.3-branch/R-GUI-7238-3.3-mavericks-Release.dmg

I'm now wondering if it would be of value to instead install the Debug version:
http://r.research.att.com/mavericks/R-devel/R-GUI-7238-3.4-mavericks-Debug.dmg but that is a decision above my pay grade.

My R console very often (but not always) crashes on opening a script by
clicking on the icon.
All the best, Enrico

I am encountering the same issue here, but when I got a different result as 
below, what should I do for the next?

> Sys.getenv("DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH")
[1] 
"/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/lib:/Users/eileen/lib:/usr/local/lib:/usr/lib::"

Thanks,
Eileen
