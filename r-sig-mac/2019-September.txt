I shall def ask in the future (I just assumed what was on the macOS dev page was it and received the result of what I usually get for assuming things :-)

https://git.rud.is/hrbrmstr/official-rswitch has the official RSwitch from the SVN link you provided. It's been upgraded to a more modern Xcode project format and also has had deprecated Objective C methods migrated to non-deprecated ones. The nib has been converted to a xib and it should render equally well on dark and light mode enabled systems. Ideally it would get entitlements and be signed & notarized (and, you are likely well aware of these modern day hurdles but I'm just saying it for completeness to the entire list who might not as steeped in the development of mac apps). I can put ^^ on GitHub or anywhere else if it would be more convenient than my self-hosted gitea instance.

https://git.rud.is/hrbrmstr/RSwitch is the revamped Swift version I've made and it's now (as of the non-released 1.4.2 dev version) on-par feature-wise with the original in that it includes the precise version info along with the maj.min symlink version; and, it uses pretty much the same methods as the original RSwitch did/does including reading of Rversion.h to get the precise maj.min.pat version. A png of that is attached (I never remember if attachments make it or not so said png is at https://rud.is/gl/rswitch-swift.png). Two recent releases (1.4.0 and 1.4.1) have made it through the notarization gauntlet as well.

I've expanded the scope of it a bit (or more) as you'll see as you scan through it but it's def welcome to be on CRAN. I'm not sure of some of the expanded scope (it also references a vendor product) wld make that problematic or not, tho.

I have repeatedly been encountering a problem reading into R nexus files that I created in PAUP* 4.0a. I use the savetrees command in PAUP in order to get rid of edge lengths in .tre files received from my collaborator. This is useful to me since I thought I could edit things like tree and tip labels in the nexus file. But even without modifying the file exported by PAUP, I encounter this error message when I try to read the file into R (3.6.0 running on a Mac under OS 10.12.6). The Translate block has 26 labels, for the 26 taxa.

Warning message:
In matrix(x, ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE) :
  data length [51] is not a sub-multiple or multiple of the number of rows [26]

Any suggestions as to what the problem might be would be most welcome.

Thank you, ---tad.

That looks like a package issue, so I would contact the author. Some authors can be very helpful.

Message-ID: <f041f435-e28f-d819-c36a-1f08a08412e6@stats.ox.ac.uk>

As a test (I would not recommend it), I installed Command Line Tools 11 
on my Mojave machine.

1) As expected, it does not contain any macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS 
package, so the second approach in
https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-devel/R-admin.html#Recommended-C_002fC_002b_002b-compilers
is needed to use the non-Apple builds of clang.  If you do not need 
OpenMP support, one can simple use the CLT's compilers.

2) This contains the SDK for 10.15 (as did CLT 10.2.1).  However, it 
conditionally declares timespec_get, a C11 function that is finally 
added in 10.15.  autoconf does not understand the conditioning, so R's 
configure defined HAVE_TIMESPEC_GET in src/include/config.h.  I have 
worked around this in R-patched and R-devel, but for earlier versions of 
R simply comment out that line in src/include/config.h after running 
configure and before make.

Message-ID: <15FA9953-C843-4A22-8F6A-03E68858C2CD@gmail.com>

I have recently installed R 3.6.1 on my MacBook running Mac OS Mojave 10.14.5 in order to run a custom package called MH1823 (probability of detection).  This package requires me to load the following packages from CRAN, tcltk, tcltk2, survival and xlsx.

 

I have installed survival, xlsx and tlctk2 (i believe tcltk is embedded).  When I look at Package Manager i see that although the above packages are installed they are not loaded.  I can load survival but when I try to load ?xlsx? i get the following  error message is:

 

Error: package or namespace load failed for ?xlsx?:

 .onLoad failed in loadNamespace() for 'rJava', details:

  call: dyn.load(file, DLLpath = DLLpath, ...)

  error: unable to load shared object '/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.6/Resources/library/rJava/libs/rJava.so':

  Referenced from: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.6/Resources/library/rJava/libs/rJava.so

  Reason: image not found

starting httpd help server ? done

 

 

there may be a couple of hints in here.

 

 .onLoad failed in loadNamespace() for 'rJava', details  suggests the problem starts with calling rJava.

 

the next line in the error:

error: unable to load shared object '/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.6/Resources/library/rJava/libs/rJava.so':

I have checked this path and see no problems, everything seems to stack up and I find jJava.so where it is supposed to be.  However in the next line:

 dlopen(/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.6/Resources/library/rJava/libs/rJava.so, 6): Library not loaded: /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-11.0.1.jdk/Contents/Home/lib/server/libjvm.dylib

I don?t know what the number , 6 after Java.so means but have presumed version number and may be why Java8 is not working.  I also note the path ?. /JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-11.0.1.jdk/ appears as . /JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk/

suggesting a different build

 

the same occurs when I try to load the local source package MH1823

 

When I try to load HM1823 I get the error message:

* installing *source* package ?mh1823? ...

** using staged installation

** R

** data

** inst

** byte-compile and prepare package for lazy loading

Error: package or namespace load failed for ?xlsx?:

Execution halted

ERROR: lazy loading failed for package ?mh1823?

* removing ?/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.6/Resources/library/mh1823?

>

 

I find that the error message is substantially the same suggesting rJava and/or the version of Java.  I have tried removing Java 8 from my machine and installing Java 6 but don?t see any difference.  It is easy to see that Java 8 has been removed but not easy to see that 6 is installed properly as the path names are still the same.

 

When I try to load either tcltk or tcltk2, my instance of R stops responding entirely.

 

I have also installed Xquartz as I believe this is needed for Mac OS X

 

Can anyone provide some advice on what the issue might be?  I have tried reading through the FAQ?s but not found anything to point me in the right direction to correct the problem.

 

Regards,

I try to suppress any memories of this stuff every time I have had to deal with it, but...

Would "R CMD javareconf" help, maybe?

Hi Thomas,

I have a similar problem and I solved installing the jdk version 11.0.1 (I
guess this is the version that rJava expect that you have installed).  You
need to search in the JDK archive to find this version.  I tried the last
JDK version 11.0.4 and it didn't work.

After that I wrote in the terminal:

R CMD javareconf

And it works for me.

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] code-signing for builds of R from the developer page?
Message-ID: <CAJXgQP3V9cfZVmEG-mXv244Y_RVD4R7GaSWr9xy0jChMS4wWwg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

It looks like the builds of R from http://mac.r-project.org/ are typically
not code-signed, and so one normally gets a Gatekeeper warning when trying
to install them. E.g. I see (on macOS 10.14.6):

?R-3.6-branch-el-capitan.pkg? can?t be opened because it is from an
unidentified developer.

Your security preferences allow installation of only apps from the App
Store and identified developers.


Is there any chance this might change in the future?

Thanks,
Kevin

Hello:

 ????? I ask, my "Bitdefender Antivirus for Mac" blocks "R CMD check" 
with a pop up saying, "Bitdefender Safe Files blocked a new process, sh, 
from accessing your protected files.? What would you like to do?"? I'm 
allowed to allow access "For 5 minutes" or "For this time only" -- or I 
can block it forever.? I've been clicking "Allow access".


 ????? If I knew where "sh" was on my hard drive, I might be able to add 
it to a "white list" maintained by the antivirus.? Sadly, I don't know 
where it is.

Hi Spencer,

Typically via 'which' from a terminal:

~  which sh
/bin/sh

There is also 'whereis', but that will only check default system binary paths, whereas 'which' will also search your $PATH.

In this case, they return the same information:

~  whereis sh
/bin/sh


It sounds like you have the "Safe Files" option in Bitdefender enabled, which is optional, which is why the messages. I use BF also.

Regards,

Marc Schwartz

Hi, Marc:? Thanks.? I got exactly the same two answers as you got. Now I 
need to get back with Bitdefender to figure out what to do with that 
information.? Spencer

Subject: [R-SIG-Mac] How to NOT remove build directory after building a
 package?
Message-ID: <A73ED056-C83B-45BB-AB45-FA22606010D7@mac.com>

Hi,


I have been trying to build a CRAN package from the source on Mac+Fink.  However, I got an error during the build process.  How can I tell R not to remove the temporary build directory?


checking for gsl-config... /sw/opt/gsl25/bin/gsl-config
checking if GSL version >= 2.1... checking for gcc... gcc
checking whether the C compiler works... no
configure: error: in /private/tmp/RtmpqJYplW/Rbuildc37f217e13c4/gsl': configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables See config.log' for more details
ERROR: configuration failed for package 'gsl'
removing '/private/tmp/RtmpqJYplW/Rinstc37f5c43ba09/gsl'
-----------------------------------
ERROR: package installation failed


I am using Fink because Fink can install multiple versions of libraries (gsl in this case).  However, to have multiple versions, GSL libraries are installed in non-standard direcotry (/sw/opt/gsl25).  By setting:
$ export GSL_CONFIG=/sw/opt/gsl25/bin/gsl-config
I have managed to tell the location of GSL, but gcc failed somehow.  But the config.log was deleted by R.


Thanks
?

Using fink is asking for a lot of trouble, but, anyway, use

R CMD INSTALL --no-clean-on-error

The other alternative is run INSTALL on the directory instead of the tar ball.

Cheers,

For some reason signing doesn't work in cron jobs even if the keychain is unlocked. Hence only runs that I run from the shell are successfully signed (like releases). If anyone has a solution, I'd like to hear it.

Greetings and Salutations All, 

I think `launchd` jobs would properly sign the installer. `launchd` is Apple's re-envisioning of `cron`.

So, would it be possible to port over the cron job to `launchd`?

Sincerely,

JJB

Something like:

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
    <plist version="1.0">
    <dict>

      <key>Label</key>
      <string>is.rud.buildr</string>

      <key>ProgramArguments</key>
      <array>
        <string>sh</string>
        <string>-c</string>
        <string>/Users/bob/Development/R-3.6.1/build-and-sign.sh</string>
      </array>

      <key>StartCalendarInterval</key>
      <dict>
        <key>Hour</key>
        <integer>13</integer>
      </dict>

      <key>UserName</key>
      <string>bob</string>

      <key>SessionCreate</key>
      <true/>

      <key>WorkingDirectory</key>
      <string>/Users/bob/Development/R-3.6.1</string>

      <key>StandardOutPath</key>
      <string>/Users/bob/tmp/buildr-stdout.log</string>

      <key>StandardErrorPath</key>
      <string>/Users/bob/tmp/buildr-sterr.log</string>

    </dict>
    </plist>

put into ~/Library/LaunchAgents/whatever.you.want.plist

then:

    $ launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/whatever.you.want.plist

will run the build-and-sign.sh script at 1300 daily (made that up b/c it just turned 1300 here as I was typing) with std[out|err] logs preserved.

The key elements of the plist to enable access to the cert are:

      <key>UserName</key>
      <string>bob</string>

and:

      <key>SessionCreate</key>
      <true/>

That should work on any recent/supported macOS.

Use:

      $ launchctl unload -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/whatever.you.want.plist 

to unload any active launchd agent so you can reload.

To get verbose output from the code signing in the logs do:

    codesign -vs "Developer-id-stirng-from-keychain" file

I belive only:

    Resources/bin/exec/R

and any dylibs in:

    Resources/lib/

[need to|should be] be signed.

While the script name I used is "build and sign" there's no reason you couldn't just have a launchd process for the code signing and keep the R build in cron.

There are (or used to be, at least) quite a few google-able solutions to other scenarios for this, the most common of which has the use of Jenkins (or other build pipeline managers) to manage build pipelines for macOS and iOS apps. I did a quick "jenkins macos code sign" and they all still seem to be there (just looked at the list, didn't dig into the URLs to see if they're alive).

(apologies for a second spam addendum, I hit "send" too quickly)

In theory, once the latest Xcode is truly stable (the Xcode 11 GM is broken in some places so there's going to be another release before Apple release macOS Vista in October) the notarization "API" (that's way too kind of a word for it) should be fully baked and can be added to any build pipeline. That will require some other things for command line binaries (e.g. an Info.plist and entitlements file just for the notarization) to get ask for, receive, and then staple a ticket to a command line app.

R.app will likely "need" said stapling come January 2020 (to avoid the "this app is malware" message from Apple).

For the previous mail, you should be able to also use `productsign` to sign the installer the same way.

Thanks, Bob (and JJB)!

I have put the signing in a launch agent and we?ll see.

As for notarization, that will be interesting. The R installer is fine, the R.app likely, too (except for the hardening requirement and Xcode versions), but I?m not sure how that will affect the R.framework. I?ll experiment later next week.

Cheers,
Simon

I can confirm the newest published installers for R on
http://mac.r-project.org/ are now signed. Thanks for taking a look so
quickly!

Best,
Kevin
