Message-ID: <87h7hexxuf.fsf@gmail.com>

Hello,

I have been surprised when converting a character string to a date with the following
format,

in R 4.1.0 (linux debian 10)

as.Date("20-12-2020","%Y-%m-%d")
[1] "20-12-20"

in R 4.0.5 (window 10)

as.Date("20-12-2020","%Y-%m-%d")
[1] "0020-12-20"


Here I was expecting a blunt and sharp NA, am I missing something?

Best regards,
Jeremie

Yes, it is rather strange to specify "2020" as the day and "20" as the 
4digits year, so different implementations may print the year in 2 or 4 
digits. What you want is actually

as.Date("20-12-2020","%d-%m-%Y")

Hi Jeremie,
Try:

as.Date("20-12-2020","%y-%m-%d")
[1] "2020-12-20"

Hm.

Seems to me, that both your codes are wrong but printing in Linux is
different from Windows.

With
as.Date("20-12-2020","%Y-%m-%d")
you say that 20 is year (actually year 20) and 2020 is day and only first
two values are taken (but with some valueas result is NA)

I can confirm 4.0.3 in Windows behaves this way too.

Thanks for this info. I'm looking for something that produce NA if the
date is not exactly in the specified format so that it can be
corrected. I was relying on the format parameter of the date for that.

The issue is that there can be so many variations in date format that for the time
being I still find it easier to delegate the correction to the user. A
particular nasty case is when there are multiple date format in the same
column.


Best regards,
Jeremie

Hi Adrianna,
I can see why you may be confused about the input file to create the
dataframe for bibliometrix. Looking at the 'convert2db' function, it
seems to shuffle the various formats to a common order used by other
functions. The help page describes that order. I would look at the
sample file 'scientometrics' as it seems to be a plain text file. If
you set up your CSV file in that format, it should be read by the
convert2df function with the default 'plaintext' format argument.

Hi

Maybe you could inspect

parse_date_time {lubridate}	R Documentation

from package lubridate.

Or see answers here

You could explicitly test whether the specified format
is as expcected, perhaps with a regex such as

    s <- c("2020-01-20", "20-12-2020")
    grepl("^[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9]$", s)

and/or by checking the components of the dates:

    valid_Date <- function(s) {
        tmp <- strsplit(s, "[-]")
    
        year <- as.numeric(sapply(tmp, `[[`, 1))
        valid.year <- year < 2500 & year > 1800
    
        month <- as.numeric(sapply(tmp, `[[`, 2))
        valid.month <- month >= 0 & month <= 12
    
        day <- as.numeric(sapply(tmp, `[[`, 3))
        valid.day <- day >= 1 & day <= 31
    
        ans <- as.Date(s)
        ans[!(valid.year & valid.month & valid.day)] <- NA
        ans    
    }

Subject: [R] concatenating columns in data.frame
Message-ID: <e0a0d23f-c4a6-540c-be31-90ba894dba11@gmail.com>

I need to create a new data.frame column as a concatenation of existing 
character columns. But the number and name of the columns to concatenate 
needs to be passed in dynamically. The code below does what I want, but 
seems very clumsy. Any suggestions how to improve?


df = data.frame("A"=sample(letters, 10), "B"=sample(letters, 10), 
"C"=sample(letters,10), "D"=sample(letters, 10))

# Which columns to concat:

use_columns = c("D", "B")


UpdateCombo = function(df, use_columns) {
 ??? use_df = df[, use_columns]
 ??? combo_list = lapply(1:nrow(use_df), function(r) {
 ??? r_combo = paste(use_df[r,], collapse="_")
 ??? return(data.frame("Combo" = r_combo))
 ??? })
 ??? combo = do.call(rbind, combo_list)

 ??? names(combo) = "Combo"

 ??? return(combo)

}


combo_col = UpdateCombo(df, use_columns)

df_combo = do.call(cbind, list(df, combo_col))


Thanks

You can do the same steps but without so much intermediate saving to
shorten it

f <- function(x) {
  do.call(rbind,lapply(1:nrow(x),
                       function(r) {paste(x[r,], collapse="_")}))
}

df_combo <- cbind(df,Combo=f(df[,c(4,2)]))

I'd do this:


UpdateCombo <-
  function(df, use_columns){
    pasteUnder <- function(...) paste(..., sep="_")
    do.call(pasteUnder, df[, use_columns])
  }

df_combo <- cbind(df, Combo=UpdateCombo(df, use_columns))

HTH,

Why not simply:

## reprex
set.seed(123)
df = data.frame("A"=sample(letters, 10), "B"=sample(letters, 10),
                "C"=sample(letters,10), "D"=sample(letters, 10))
df
use_columns = c("D", "B")

## one liner
df$combo_col <- do.call(paste,c(df[,use_columns], sep = "_"))
df

In case you are wondering, this works because by definition *a date
frame **is** a list*, so the concatenation is list concatenation.

Why not? 

Because I erroneously thought that there is a "data.frame' method for `c` and that this would cause a problem.

But I was wrong, so your solution wins.

Please make the effort to post plain text email... formatted email gets stripped and what remains is often garbled.

Most people use dbGetQuery... but reading the help page accessible via ?dbSendQuery should clarify how it should be used.

Message-ID: <CH2PR13MB3640B172896B6B89B1A65431FA1F9@CH2PR13MB3640.namprd13.prod.outlook.com>

Hi R-Helpers,

I am taking it upon myself to delve into the world of lists for R.  In no small part because I appear to have discovered a source of data for an exceptionally good price but that delivers much of that data in json format.

So over the last day or so I managed to fight the list processing tools to a draw and get a list that has only selected elements (actually it ends up in matrix form).  But when I try to convert that to a data frame I can't get it to a form that is workable.

I have visited some pages about converting a matrix to a data frame but they result in highly redundant and inelegant data.

I am thinking that someone who works with lists and matrices knows how to do this quite easily and would be willing to provide a solution.

The reproducible example is shown below.  Just to be explicit, what I am trying to get to is something along the lines of a data frame like this.

Date              netIncome      Gross Profit
2020-09-30 57411000000 104956000000
2019-09-30 55256000000   98392000000

.....

The closest I get is a matrix that looks like this

> wanted
            2020-09-30        2019-09-30       2018-09-30        2017-09-30       2016-09-30       2015-09-30       2014-09-30
date        "2020-09-30"      "2019-09-30"     "2018-09-30"      "2017-09-30"     "2016-09-30"     "2015-09-30"     "2014-09-30"
netIncome   "57411000000.00"  "55256000000.00" "59531000000.00"  "48351000000.00" "45687000000.00" "53394000000.00" "39510000000.00"
grossProfit "104956000000.00" "98392000000.00" "101839000000.00" "88186000000.00" "84263000000.00" "93626000000.00" "70537000000.00"

Code for example

library(jsonlite)
test <- jsonlite::fromJSON("https://eodhistoricaldata.com/api/fundamentals/AAPL.US?api_token=OeAFFmMliFG5orCUuwAKQ8l4WWFQ67YX")

hist<-test[[13]]
ISY<-hist$Income_Statement$yearly
wanted<-sapply(ISY, "[", j = c("date","netIncome","grossProfit"))


Your guidance would be much appreciated.

Subject: [R] concatenating columns in data.frame
References: <e0a0d23f-c4a6-540c-be31-90ba894dba11@gmail.com> 
Message-ID: <056701d76ef4$173342f0$4599c8d0$@verizon.net>

Micha,

Others have provided ways in standard R so I will contribute a somewhat odd solution using the dplyr and related packages in the tidyverse including a sample data.frame/tibble I made. It requires newer versions of R and other  packages as it uses some fairly esoteric features including "the big bang" and the new ":=" operator and more.

You can use your own data with whatever columns you need, of course.

The goal is to have umpteen columns in the data that you want to add an additional columns to an existing tibble that is the result of concatenating the rowwise contents of a dynamically supplied vector of column names in quotes. First we need something to work with so here is a sample:

#--start
# load required packages, or a bunch at once!
library(tidyverse)

# Pick how many rows you want. For a demo, 3 is plenty N <- 3

# Make a sample tibble with N rows and the following 4 columns mydf <- tibble(alpha = 1:N, 
               beta=letters[1:N],
               gamma = N:1,
               delta = month.abb[1:N])

# show the original tibble
print(mydf)
#--end

In flat text mode, here is the output:

> print(mydf)
# A tibble: 3 x 4
alpha beta  gamma delta
<int> <chr> <int> <chr>
  1     1 a         3 Jan  
2     2 b         2 Feb  
3     3 c         1 Mar

Now I want to make a function that is used instead of the mutate verb. I made a weird one-liner that is a tad hard to explain so first let me mention the requirements.

It will take a first argument that is a tibble and in a pipeline this would be passed invisibly.
The second required argument is a vector or list containing the names of the columns as strings. A column can be re-used multiple times.
The third optional argument is what to name the new column with a default if omitted.
The fourth optional argument allows you to choose a different separator than "" if you wish.

The function should be usable in a pipeline on both sides so it should also return the input tibble with an extra column to the output.

Here is the function:

my_mutate <- function(df, columns, colnew="concatenated", sep=""){
  df %>%
    mutate( "{colnew}" := paste(!!!rlang::syms(columns), sep = sep )) }

Yes, the above can be done inline as a long one-liner:

my_mutate <- function(df, columns, colnew="concatenated", sep="") mutate(df, "{colnew}" := paste(!!!rlang::syms(columns), sep = sep ))

Here are examples of it running:


> choices <- c("beta", "delta", "alpha", "delta") mydf %>% 
> my_mutate(choices, "me2")
# A tibble: 3 x 5
alpha beta  gamma delta me2     
<int> <chr> <int> <chr> <chr>   
  1     1 a         3 Jan   aJan1Jan
2     2 b         2 Feb   bFeb2Feb
3     3 c         1 Mar   cMar3Mar
> mydf %>% my_mutate(choices, "me2",":")
# A tibble: 3 x 5
alpha beta  gamma delta me2        
<int> <chr> <int> <chr> <chr>

Does this meet your normal need? Just to show it works in a pipeline, here is a variant:

mydf %>%
  tail(2) %>%
  my_mutate(c("beta", "beta"), "betabeta") %>%
  print() %>%
  my_mutate(list("alpha", "betabeta", "gamma"),
            "buildson", 
            "&")

The above only keeps the last two lines of the tibble, makes a double copy of "beta" under a new name, prints the intermediate result, continues to make another concatenation using the variable created earlier then prints the result:

Here is the run:

> mydf %>%
  +   tail(2) %>%
  +   my_mutate(c("beta", "beta"), "betabeta") %>%
  +   print() %>%
  +   my_mutate(list("alpha", "betabeta", "gamma"),
                +             "buildson", 
                +             "&")
# A tibble: 2 x 5
alpha beta  gamma delta betabeta
<int> <chr> <int> <chr> <chr>   
  1     2 b         2 Feb   bb      
2     3 c         1 Mar   cc      
# A tibble: 2 x 6
alpha beta  gamma delta betabeta buildson
<int> <chr> <int> <chr> <chr>    <chr>   
  1     2 b         2 Feb   bb       2&bb&2  
2     3 c         1 Mar   cc       3&cc&1  

As to how the darn function works, that was a learning experience for me to build using features I have not had occasion to use. If anyone remains interested, read on. 

The following needs newish features:

	"{colnew}" := SOMETHING

The colon-equals operator in newer R/dplyr can be sort of used in an odd way that allows the name of the variable to be in quotes and in brackets akin to the way glue() does it. The variable colnew is evaluated and substituted so the name used for the column is now dynamic.

The function does a paste using this:

	!!!rlang::syms(columns)

The problem is paste() wants multiple arguments and we have a single argument that is either a vector or another kind of vector called a list. The trick is to convert the vector into symbols then use "!!!" to convert something like 'c("alpha", "beta", "gamma")' into something more like ' "alpha", "beta", "gamma" ' so that paste sees them as multiple arguments to concatenate in vector fashion.

And, the function is not polished but I am sure you can all see some of what is needed like checking the arguments for validity, including not having a name for the new column that clashes with existing column names, doing something sane if no columns to concatenate are offered and so on.

Just showing a different approach. The base R methods are fine.

Subject: [R] concatenating columns in data.frame

I need to create a new data.frame column as a concatenation of existing character columns. But the number and name of the columns to concatenate needs to be passed in dynamically. The code below does what I want, but seems very clumsy. Any suggestions how to improve?


df = data.frame("A"=sample(letters, 10), "B"=sample(letters, 10), "C"=sample(letters,10), "D"=sample(letters, 10))

# Which columns to concat:

use_columns = c("D", "B")


UpdateCombo = function(df, use_columns) {
     use_df = df[, use_columns]
     combo_list = lapply(1:nrow(use_df), function(r) {
     r_combo = paste(use_df[r,], collapse="_")
     return(data.frame("Combo" = r_combo))
     })
     combo = do.call(rbind, combo_list)

     names(combo) = "Combo"

     return(combo)

}


combo_col = UpdateCombo(df, use_columns)

df_combo = do.call(cbind, list(df, combo_col))


Thanks

Bill,

A Matrix can only contain one kind of data. I ran your code after modifying
it to be proper and took a transpose to get it risght-side up:

t(wanted)
date         netIncome        grossProfit      
2020-09-30 "2020-09-30" "57411000000.00" "104956000000.00"
2019-09-30 "2019-09-30" "55256000000.00" "98392000000.00" 
2018-09-30 "2018-09-30" "59531000000.00" "101839000000.00"
2017-09-30 "2017-09-30" "48351000000.00" "88186000000.00"

That looks better, I think.

So I did this:

wanted <- t(wanted)

It has rownames and colnames and you can make it a data frame easily enough:

mydf <- data.frame(wanted)

But the columns are all character strings, so CONVERT them as you wish:

> mydf
date      netIncome     grossProfit
2020-09-30 2020-09-30 57411000000.00 104956000000.00
2019-09-30 2019-09-30 55256000000.00  98392000000.00
2018-09-30 2018-09-30 59531000000.00 101839000000.00

Your numbers are quite large and may or may not be meant to be integers:

> mydf$netIncome <- as.numeric(mydf$netIncome)
> mydf$grossProfit <- as.numeric(mydf$grossProfit)
> head(mydf)
date  netIncome grossProfit
2020-09-30 2020-09-30 5.7411e+10 1.04956e+11
2019-09-30 2019-09-30 5.5256e+10 9.83920e+10
2018-09-30 2018-09-30 5.9531e+10 1.01839e+11
2017-09-30 2017-09-30 4.8351e+10 8.81860e+10
2016-09-30 2016-09-30 4.5687e+10 8.42630e+10
2015-09-30 2015-09-30 5.3394e+10 9.36260e+10

The first entries may have something wrong as they become NA when I make
them integers.

The date column is the same as the rownames and is not in a normal vector
format. It shows as a list and you may want to convert it to one of several
formats R supports for dates or a more normal character string. 

So here is how I made it a character string:

> mydf <- as.data.frame(wanted)
> mydf$date <- as.character(mydf$date)
> mydf$netIncome <- as.numeric(mydf$netIncome)
> mydf$grossProfit <- as.numeric(mydf$grossProfit)
> head(mydf)
date  netIncome grossProfit
2020-09-30 2020-09-30 5.7411e+10 1.04956e+11
2019-09-30 2019-09-30 5.5256e+10 9.83920e+10
2018-09-30 2018-09-30 5.9531e+10 1.01839e+11
2017-09-30 2017-09-30 4.8351e+10 8.81860e+10
2016-09-30 2016-09-30 4.5687e+10 8.42630e+10
2015-09-30 2015-09-30 5.3394e+10 9.36260e+10

If you want a DATE, it can now be converted again using one of many methods.

Just FYI, numbers that big and rounded might work just as well measured in
millions as in what I did to grossProfit:

> mydf$grossProfit <- as.integer(mydf$grossProfit/1000000)
> mydf$netIncome <- as.integer(mydf$netIncome/1000000)
> head(mydf)
date netIncome grossProfit
2020-09-30 2020-09-30     57411      104956
2019-09-30 2019-09-30     55256       98392
2018-09-30 2018-09-30     59531      101839
2017-09-30 2017-09-30     48351       88186
2016-09-30 2016-09-30     45687       84263
2015-09-30 2015-09-30     53394       93626

Some of the numbers are negative though.

If rownames are not needed:

> rownames(mydf) <- NULL
> head(mydf)
date netIncome grossProfit
1 2020-09-30     57411      104956
2 2019-09-30     55256       98392
3 2018-09-30     59531      101839
4 2017-09-30     48351       88186
5 2016-09-30     45687       84263
6 2015-09-30     53394       93626

It may be easier to work with this, but again, if you need the dates to be
real dates, as in graphing.

Hope that helps.

Hello List,I need to generate summary report for many tables (>200 tables). For each table, I can use the script to generate repost:
res <- dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT * FROM BIODBX.MECCUNIQUE2")view(dfSummary(res), file = "W:/project/_Joe.B/MSSQL/try/summarytools.BIODBX.MECCUNIQUE2.html")rm(res)
BIODBX.MECCUNIQUE2 is the name of table.
I have all of tables' name in a data frame. So, I'm trying to write a function to do this:

1. I created? a function summ, the argument is Tabname. I put the Tabname in the function.

Hello List,

The previous post look massy. I repost my question. Sorry,


I need to generate summary report for many tables (>200 tables). For each table, I can use the script to generate report:

}
for (i in dbtable$Tot_table)
{
? Tabname <- as.character(sqldf(sprintf("SELECT Tot_table FROM dbtable", i)))
? summ(Tabname)
}

1. I created? a function summ, the argument is Tabname. I put the Tabname in the function. I hope it can be replaced one by one
2. the table dbtable contents all tables' name (>200 rows), the field name is Tot_table

Hi R-Helpers,

I am taking it upon myself to delve into the world of lists for R.  In no small part because I appear to have discovered a source of data for an exceptionally good price but that delivers much of that data in json format.

So over the last day or so I managed to fight the list processing tools to a draw and get a list that has only selected elements (actually it ends up in matrix form).  But when I try to convert that to a data frame I can't get it to a form that is workable.

I have visited some pages about converting a matrix to a data frame but they result in highly redundant and inelegant data.

I am thinking that someone who works with lists and matrices knows how to do this quite easily and would be willing to provide a solution.

The reproducible example is shown below.  Just to be explicit, what I am trying to get to is something along the lines of a data frame like this.

Date              netIncome      Gross Profit
2020-09-30 57411000000 104956000000
2019-09-30 55256000000   98392000000

.....

The closest I get is a matrix that looks like this

Modify the summ() function to start like this

summ <- function(Tabname){
   query <- sprintf(" SELECT * FROM %s",Tabname)
  res <- dbGetQuery(con, query)

etc

 Hello Eric,
Following your suggestion, I modified the code as:
summ <- function(Tabname){
? query <- sprintf(" SELECT * FROM %s",Tabname)
? res <- dbGetQuery(con, query)
? view(dfSummary(res), file = "W:/project/_Joe.B/MSSQL/try/summarytools.Tabname.html")
? rm(res)
}

for (i in dbtable$Tot_table)
{
? Tabname <- as.character(sqldf(sprintf("SELECT Tot_table FROM dbtable", i)))
? summ(Tabname)
}
after submitted the work, I got the error message below:

?Error: nanodbc/nanodbc.cpp:1655: 42000: [Microsoft][ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server][SQL Server]Invalid object name 'c'.?

One more question,? in the code of "view(dfSummary(res), file = "W:/project/_Joe.B/MSSQL/try/summarytools.Tabname.html")",
can Tabname part be replacted automatic also??
Thank you,

Hello List,

The previous post look massy. I repost my question. Sorry,


I need to generate summary report for many tables (>200 tables). For each table, I can use the script to generate report:
res <- dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT * FROM BIODBX.MECCUNIQUE2")
view(dfSummary(res), file = "W:/project/_Joe.B/MSSQL/try/summarytools.BIODBX.MECCUNIQUE2.html")
rm(res)
BIODBX.MECCUNIQUE2 is the name of table.

I have all of tables' name in a data frame. So, I'm trying to write a function to do this:
summ <- function(Tabname){
? res <- dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT * FROM Tabname")
? view(dfSummary(res), file = "W:/project/_Joe.B/MSSQL/try/summarytools.Tabname.html")
? rm(res)
}
for (i in dbtable$Tot_table)
{
? Tabname <- as.character(sqldf(sprintf("SELECT Tot_table FROM dbtable", i)))
? summ(Tabname)
}

1. I created? a function summ, the argument is Tabname. I put the Tabname in the function. I hope it can be replaced one by one
2. the table dbtable contents all tables' name (>200 rows), the field name is Tot_table
3. I want use "for" to establish a loop, which can automatic generate a summary report for each table

but I got error message below:
?Error: nanodbc/nanodbc.cpp:1655: 42000: [Microsoft][ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server][SQL Server]Invalid object name 'Tabname'.??

4..local(conn, statement, ...)?
3.dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT * FROM Tabname")?
2.dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT * FROM Tabname")?
1.summ(Tabname)?

it seems the tables' name is not successfully pass into query. can someone give me an instruction for this?
many thanks,

Hard for me to tell without more details but it looks like the following
has several bugs

for (i in dbtable$Tot_table)
{
  Tabname <- as.character(sqldf(sprintf("SELECT Tot_table FROM dbtable",
i)))
  summ(Tabname)
}

Your sprintf() statement seems to use 'i' but actually does not.
You probably want to rewrite/rearrange this code. More like

x <- sqldf("SELECT Tot_table FROM dbtable")
for ( Tabname in x )
summ(Tabname)

no doubt this is wrong but put a browser() call after the x <- sqldf(...)
line and inspect x and go from there

 Hi Eric,
Thank you spent time to help me for this.

Here is the thing: I was requested to manage a sql server for my group. the server has many schemas and the tables (>200). I use ODBC to connect the server and get the schema name + table name into a data frame.

For each of schema + table on server, I need to run a summary report. So I wrote a summary script like this:

res <- dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT * FROM BIODBX.MECCUNIQUE2")
view(dfSummary(res), file = "W:/project/_Joe.B/MSSQL/try/summarytools.BIODBX.MECCUNIQUE2.html")
rm(res)

the script works well. but I don't want to write 200+ times of the script to summary each table. So, I'm trying to write the function to do this. this is my goal.

First of all, I'm not sure if this is the right way to do the summary report, because I'm a new R user. So please correct me if my idea is doable.

Second, would you please tell me what is "more detail" information do you need?

Thank you,
Kai

One more question,? in the code of "view(dfSummary(res), file = "W:/project/_Joe.B/MSSQL/try/summarytools.Tabname.html")",
can Tabname part be replacted automatic also??

 Modify the summ() function to start like this?
summ <- function(Tabname){? ?query <- sprintf("SELECT * FROM?%s",Tabname)

Hello List,

The previous post look massy. I repost my question. Sorry,


I need to generate summary report for many tables (>200 tables). For each table, I can use the script to generate report:
res <- dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT * FROM BIODBX.MECCUNIQUE2")
view(dfSummary(res), file = "W:/project/_Joe.B/MSSQL/try/summarytools.BIODBX.MECCUNIQUE2.html")
rm(res)
BIODBX.MECCUNIQUE2 is the name of table.

I have all of tables' name in a data frame. So, I'm trying to write a function to do this:
summ <- function(Tabname){
? res <- dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT * FROM Tabname")
? view(dfSummary(res), file = "W:/project/_Joe.B/MSSQL/try/summarytools.Tabname.html")
? rm(res)
}
for (i in dbtable$Tot_table)
{
? Tabname <- as.character(sqldf(sprintf("SELECT Tot_table FROM dbtable", i)))
? summ(Tabname)
}

1. I created? a function summ, the argument is Tabname. I put the Tabname in the function. I hope it can be replaced one by one
2. the table dbtable contents all tables' name (>200 rows), the field name is Tot_table
3. I want use "for" to establish a loop, which can automatic generate a summary report for each table

but I got error message below:
?Error: nanodbc/nanodbc.cpp:1655: 42000: [Microsoft][ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server][SQL Server]Invalid object name 'Tabname'.??
[Microsoft][ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server][SQL Server]Statement(s) could not be prepared.?

8.OdbcResult(connection = conn, statement = statement, params = params,? ? ?immediate = immediate)?
7..local(conn, statement, ...)?
6.dbSendQuery(conn, statement, params = params, ...)?
5.dbSendQuery(conn, statement, params = params, ...)?
4..local(conn, statement, ...)?
3.dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT * FROM Tabname")?
2.dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT * FROM Tabname")?
1.summ(Tabname)?

it seems the tables' name is not successfully pass into query. can someone give me an instruction for this?
many thanks,
Kai

Definitely doable and you are on the right path and maybe even close.
The error message you got showed your query as having the wrong info after
the 'FROM'
keyword

<SQL> ' SELECT * FROM c("BIODBX.MECCUNIQUE2", "BIODBX.QDATA_HTML_DUMMY",
"BIODBX.SET_ITEMS", "BIODBX.SET_NAMES", "dbo.sysdiagrams",
"GEMD.ASSAY_DEFINITIONS",

etc

i.e you are passing the full vector of table names and not a single one
(the first being the one specified in your working example)

You have to figure out how to correctly set up your loop on this vector of
table names.
The debugger - browser() - is your friend! Learn how to use it, as I
suggested before.

I know what you mean Jeff. Yes I am very familiar with base R techniques. What I had hoped for was to do two things that some of the other methods mentioned do that ended up bringing two data.frames together as part of the solution.

Much of what I used is now standard R. I was looking at the accessory functions now commonly used in dplyr that let you dynamically select which columns to work with like begins_with() to choose. Sadly, they seem to work on a top-level but not easily within a call to something like paste(...) where they are not evaluated in the way I want.

But the odd method I tried can also be used in standard R with a bit of work. You can create a function without using dplyr that takes your df and uses it to concatenate and end with something like:

df$new_col <- do_something(df, selected_cols)

That too adds a column without the need to merge larger structures explicitly..

But your other point is a tad religious in a sense. I happen to prefer learning a core language first then looking at enhancement opportunities. But at some point, if teaching someone new who wants to focus on getting a job done simply but not necessarily repeatedly or in some ideal way, it is best to do things in a way that their mind flows better.

Many things in the tidyverse are redundant with base R or just "fix" inconsistencies like making sure the first argument is always the same. But many add substantially to doing things in a more step-by-step manner.

I do not worship the base language as it first came out or even as it has evolved. I do like to know what choices I have and pick and choose among them as needed. Of course a forum like this is more about base R than otherwise and I acknowledge that. Still, the ":=" operator is now base R. There is a new pipeline operator "|>" in base R. Some ideas, good or otherwise, do get in eventually.

I started doing graphs using base R as in the plot() command. It was adequate but I wanted better. So I learned about Lattice and various packages and eventually ggplot. I can now do things I barely imagined before and am still learning that there is much more I can do with packages underneath much of the magic and also additional packages layered above it, in some sense. So I do not approach that with an either-or mentality either.

Note I am not really talking about just R. I have similar issues with other languages I program in such as Python. None of them were created fully-formed and many had to add huge amounts to adapt to additional wants and needs. Base R for me is often inadequate. But so what?

The task being asked for in this thread in isolation, indeed may not be done any better using packages. However, if it is part of a larger set of tasks that can be pipelined, it may well be and I personally was wondering if there was a way in dplyr. There probably is a much better way than I assembled if I only knew about it, and if not, they may add this kind of indirection in a future release if deemed worthy of doing. I have gone back to programs I did years ago with humungous amounts of code using what I knew then and reducing it drastically now that I can tell a function to select say all my column names that end in .orig and apply a set of functions to them with output going to the base name followed by .mean and .sd and so on. All that can often be done in one or two lines of code where previously I had to do 18 near repetitions of each part and then another and another. That used a limited form of dynamism.

Be that as it may I think the requester has enough info and we can move on.

I use parts of the tidyverse frequently, but this post is the best argument I can imagine for learning base R techniques.

Subject: [R] add a variable a data frame  to sequentially count unique rows
Message-ID: <SJ0PR02MB7645A67CD8ACF60FA841FE87D41F9@SJ0PR02MB7645.namprd02.prod.outlook.com>

Hi R users,

In this test file,
test  <- data.frame(group1=c("g1", "g1", "g1", "g2", "g2", "g2", "g2", "g2", "g2"),
                                       group2=c("k1", "a2", "a2", "c5", "n6", "n6", "n6", "m10","m10"),
                                       count= c( 1,     1,    2,   1,     2,   2,     2,    3,    3 ));

I have group 1 and group2 variable and want to add the count variable to sequentially count unique rows defined by group1 and group2.  

I hope to use the following functions in library (tidyverse),  No one worked well.
test %>% group_by(group1, group2) %>% mutate(count = row_number())
test %>% group_by(group1, group2) %>% mutate(count = 1:n())
test %>% group_by(group1, group2) %>% mutate(count = seq_len(n()))
test %>% group_by(group1, group2) %>% mutate(count = seq_along(group1, group2))

Can you help me to make the third column in the test data frame?

Thank you,

Ding

It is poor analytical design to keep duplicates. If they are not duplicates then there should be a distinguishing additional column. IMO you should re-think your analysis rather than accomplish this short-term goal only to find down the road that this duplication causes future problems.

Hi Jeff,

Thank you for your quick response!!
I made this following summary file, however, I want to add the count number sequentially into the original file, because I have several more columns to explain or annotate the first two columns.

count_test <- test %>% group_by(group1 ) %>%summarise(Number_of_region = n_distinct(group2))

Your example makes no sense (to me, anyway). Please check it
carefully. Note that the count in rows 2 and 3 increment but the
counts in rows 5-7 or rows 8-9 do not. So your specification seems
inconsistent to me.

I am not sure I understand... you are referring to files but we are not 
discussing files here. There are "input" and "output" phases yet to be 
dealt with that separate the analysis you do in R from the files 
themselves. We are discussing data frames here.

Regardless, you either have duplicates in your input (faulty data) or you 
do not have duplicates because there are additional distinguishing columns 
that you have not identified. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_key)

The solution to the problem that you should not have involves making a 
sensible (not faulty) copy of your data, setting up the count column, and 
then joining the faulty data with the sensible data.

Note that the ordering of the result happens to be retained when using 
dplyr::left_join, but is not retained using most other join 
implementations (such as base::merge). There can be significant 
performance gains to be had by giving up on record ordering, which is one 
of the reasons why having a valid primary key can be so important.

library(dplyr)
lookup_df <- (   test
              %>% select( group1, group2 )
              %>% filter( !duplicated( . ) )
              %>% group_by( group1 )
              %>% mutate( count1 = seq.int( n() ) )
              %>% ungroup()
              )
ans <- left_join( test, lookup_df, by = c( "group1", "group2" ) )

Hi Bert,

I am very sorry that I made a mistake for the second count value. The original data are much more complicated, I just made a toy table.


 test  <- data.frame(group1=c("g1", "g1", "g1", "g2", "g2", "g2", "g2", "g2", "g2"),
                                        group2=c("k1", "a2", "a2", "c5", "n6", "n6", "n6", "m10","m10"),
                                         count=   c( 1,       2,        2,       1,      2,   2,     2,    3,    3 ));

I want to get count column.

the summary count is below.
count_test <- test %>% group_by(group1 ) %>%summarise(Number_of_region = n_distinct(group2))

Thank you,

Ding

Your example makes no sense (to me, anyway). Please check it carefully. Note that the count in rows 2 and 3 increment but the counts in rows 5-7 or rows 8-9 do not. So your specification seems inconsistent to me.

I am very agnostic about tidyverse/base R. However, the complexity of 
setting up NSE functions is often simply not needed, and I encounter so 
many people who simply disregard base R as being too outdated so that they 
never learn how simple solutions in R can be. The contrast between your 
solution and Bert's was... perhaps informative, but a nuclear bomb where 
an axe was sufficient.

Of course a forum like this is more about base R than otherwise and I acknowledge that. Still, the ":=" operator is now base R. There is a new pipeline operator "|>" in base R. Some ideas, good or otherwise, do get in eventually.

I can now do things I barely imagined before and am still learning that there is much more I can do with packages underneath much of the magic and also additional packages layered above it, in some sense. So I do not approach that with an either-or mentality either.

However, if it is part of a larger set of tasks that can be pipelined, it may well be and I personally was wondering if there was a way in dplyr. There probably is a much better way than I assembled if I only knew about it, and if not, they may add this kind of indirection in a future release if deemed worthy of doing. I have gone back to programs I did years ago with humungous amounts of code using what I knew then and reducing it drastically now that I can tell a function to select say all my column names that end in .orig and apply a set of functions to them with output going to the base name followed by .mean and .sd and so on. All that can often be done in one or two lines of code where previously I had to do 18 near repetitions of each part and then another and another. That used a limited form of dynamism.

Hi Jeff,
Your code generated the count what I wanted.    

As I emailed to Bert, yes, I made a mistake when generating the toy table,  the second count value should be 2.
Correct file is 
test  <- data.frame(group1=c("g1", "g1", "g1", "g2", "g2", "g2", "g2", "g2", "g2"),
                    group2=c("k1", "a2", "a2", "c5", "n6", "n6", "n6", "m10","m10"),
                    count=   c(  1,      2,        2,        1,        2,        2,       2,          3,        3 ));
  
I also thought about removing of duplicates first and then doing a merge.  For some reason,  I  thought  one line of code  from tidyverse library could do it .

Thank You,

Ding

I am not sure I understand... you are referring to files but we are not discussing files here. There are "input" and "output" phases yet to be dealt with that separate the analysis you do in R from the files themselves. We are discussing data frames here.

Regardless, you either have duplicates in your input (faulty data) or you do not have duplicates because there are additional distinguishing columns that you have not identified. (https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_key__;!!Fou38LsQmgU!9delUPpdk-OQmYXQ0xQaFd2NDqykIVLC403VICI0m2ihoIqtK3XP0PTJ7-ev$ )

The solution to the problem that you should not have involves making a sensible (not faulty) copy of your data, setting up the count column, and then joining the faulty data with the sensible data.

Note that the ordering of the result happens to be retained when using dplyr::left_join, but is not retained using most other join implementations (such as base::merge). There can be significant performance gains to be had by giving up on record ordering, which is one of the reasons why having a valid primary key can be so important.

library(dplyr)
lookup_df <- (   test
              %>% select( group1, group2 )
              %>% filter( !duplicated( . ) )
              %>% group_by( group1 )
              %>% mutate( count1 = seq.int( n() ) )
              %>% ungroup()
              )
ans <- left_join( test, lookup_df, by = c( "group1", "group2" ) )

Ding,

Just to get you to stop asking, here is a solution I hope works.

In English, if you are asking that ONE instance of a duplicate be marked in
a new column with TRUE or 1 while all remaining ones are marked as FALSE or
2 or whatever, that is easy enough. The method is to use the assistive
function row_number() inside a grouped mutate() and only one item has a row
number of 1 and all others higher.

If I load your test variable (see below) I can add another column I called
count2 fairly easily with this:

test %>% 
  group_by(group1,group2) %>% 
  mutate(count2 = ifelse(row_number()==1, TRUE, FALSE)) %>%
  ungroup()

The output matches your first count variable made by hand:

> test %>% 
  +   group_by(group1,group2) %>% 
  +   mutate(count2 = ifelse(row_number()==1, TRUE, FALSE)) %>%
  +   ungroup()
# A tibble: 9 x 4
group1 group2 count count2
<chr>  <chr>  <dbl> <lgl> 
  1 g1     k1         1 TRUE  
2 g1     a2         1 TRUE  
3 g1     a2         2 FALSE 
4 g2     c5         1 TRUE  
5 g2     n6         2 TRUE  
6 g2     n6         2 FALSE 
7 g2     n6         2 FALSE 
8 g2     m10        3 TRUE  
9 g2     m10        3 FALSE

Now if you actually want to have a count of first and 2nd and third, it is
even easier:

test %>% 
  group_by(group1,group2) %>% 
  mutate(counter = row_number()) %>%
  ungroup()

Unfortunately for you, my version of output suggest you made a mistake on
the last row with g2/n6:

> test %>% 
  +   group_by(group1,group2) %>% 
  +   mutate(counter = row_number()) %>%
  +   ungroup()
# A tibble: 9 x 4
group1 group2 count counter
<chr>  <chr>  <dbl>   <int>
  1 g1     k1         1       1
2 g1     a2         1       1
3 g1     a2         2       2
4 g2     c5         1       1
5 g2     n6         2       1
6 g2     n6         2       2
7 g2     n6         2       3
8 g2     m10        3       1
9 g2     m10        3       2

There are of course other ways to do such things but the above seems simple
enough.

Subject: [R] add a variable a data frame to sequentially count unique rows

Hi R users,

In this test file,
test  <- data.frame(group1=c("g1", "g1", "g1", "g2", "g2", "g2", "g2", "g2",
"g2"),
                                       group2=c("k1", "a2", "a2", "c5",

                                       count= c( 1,     1,    2,   1,     2,
2,     2,    3,    3 ));

I have group 1 and group2 variable and want to add the count variable to
sequentially count unique rows defined by group1 and group2.  

I hope to use the following functions in library (tidyverse),  No one worked
well.
test %>% group_by(group1, group2) %>% mutate(count = row_number()) test %>%
group_by(group1, group2) %>% mutate(count = 1:n()) test %>% group_by(group1,
group2) %>% mutate(count = seq_len(n())) test %>% group_by(group1, group2)
%>% mutate(count = seq_along(group1, group2))

Can you help me to make the third column in the test data frame?

Thank you,

Ding

Still can't makes sense of it. Shouldn't rows 5-7 have 3 for counts
and rows 8-9 have 2? If not, then I give up trying to figure out what
you mean. Maybe someone wlse can.

Hi Avi,

Thank you for your patient with me!!  

Your code below generated what I want.  
test %>%
  group_by(group1,group2) %>%
  mutate(count2 = ifelse(row_number()==1, TRUE, FALSE)) %>%
  ungroup()

your code reminded me of the SAS first. And last. Function.  I gave up SAS several years ago.

  ungroup()

The output matches your first count variable made by hand:

> test %>%
  +   group_by(group1,group2) %>% 
  +   mutate(count2 = ifelse(row_number()==1, TRUE, FALSE)) %>%
  +   ungroup()
# A tibble: 9 x 4
group1 group2 count count2
<chr>  <chr>  <dbl> <lgl> 
  1 g1     k1         1 TRUE  
2 g1     a2         1 TRUE  
3 g1     a2         2 FALSE 
4 g2     c5         1 TRUE  
5 g2     n6         2 TRUE  
6 g2     n6         2 FALSE 
7 g2     n6         2 FALSE 
8 g2     m10        3 TRUE  
9 g2     m10        3 FALSE

Now if you actually want to have a count of first and 2nd and third, it is even easier:

test %>%
  group_by(group1,group2) %>%
  mutate(counter = row_number()) %>%
  ungroup()

Unfortunately for you, my version of output suggest you made a mistake on the last row with g2/n6:

> test %>%
  +   group_by(group1,group2) %>% 
  +   mutate(counter = row_number()) %>%
  +   ungroup()
# A tibble: 9 x 4
group1 group2 count counter
<chr>  <chr>  <dbl>   <int>
  1 g1     k1         1       1
2 g1     a2         1       1
3 g1     a2         2       2
4 g2     c5         1       1
5 g2     n6         2       1
6 g2     n6         2       2
7 g2     n6         2       3
8 g2     m10        3       1
9 g2     m10        3       2

There are of course other ways to do such things but the above seems simple enough.

Subject: [R] add a variable a data frame to sequentially count unique rows

Hi R users,

In this test file,
test  <- data.frame(group1=c("g1", "g1", "g1", "g2", "g2", "g2", "g2", "g2", "g2"),
                                       group2=c("k1", "a2", "a2", "c5", "n6", "n6", "n6", "m10","m10"),
                                       count= c( 1,     1,    2,   1,     2,
2,     2,    3,    3 ));

I have group 1 and group2 variable and want to add the count variable to sequentially count unique rows defined by group1 and group2.  

I hope to use the following functions in library (tidyverse),  No one worked well.
test %>% group_by(group1, group2) %>% mutate(count = row_number()) test %>% group_by(group1, group2) %>% mutate(count = 1:n()) test %>% group_by(group1,
group2) %>% mutate(count = seq_len(n())) test %>% group_by(group1, group2) %>% mutate(count = seq_along(group1, group2))

Can you help me to make the third column in the test data frame?

Thank you,

Ding

Subject: [R] Plotting the ASCII character set.
Message-ID: <20210703140259.600cb00c@rolf-Latitude-E7470>


I have (used to have?) a function plot_ascii() which would display the
ascii character set in a graphical display.  It simply used text() to
place the symbols on a 16 x 16 grid.  The labels used by text() were
taken from a character vector that I called "all.ascii".  According to
my notes, the entries of this vector were obtained from a posting to
R-help made by the redoubtable Martin Maechler back in 2002.

This function *used* to work!  Now it doesn't.  When I invoke
plot.ascii() I get an error:

> Error in text.default(tmp, labels = all.ascii) : 
>   invalid string in PangoCairo_Text

To give a simple example, just looking at *one* of the characters,
which comes from the string "\260" in my data file:

    a <- "\260"
    plot(0,0,type="n",xlim=c(0,1),ylim=c(0,1),ann=FALSE,axes=FALSE)
    text(0.5,0.5,labels=a)

Same error.  If I type the name a I get "\xb0", which I don't
understand.  Can't get my head around character encoding.

If I do

    plot(0,0,type="n",xlim=c(0,1),ylim=c(0,1),ann=FALSE)
    text(0.5,0.5,labels="\ub0")

then I get the degree symbol plotted; I guess that b0 is the hex
encoding of the degree symbol; apparently 260 is the octal encoding of
this symbol.

Can anyone suggest how I might get my plot_ascii() function working
again?  Basically, it seems to me, the question is:  how do I persuade
R to read in "\260" as "\ub0" rather than "\xb0"?

I hope for enlightenment! :-)

cheers,

Rolf Turner

Hello,

Either I'm not understanding or isn't this just any of


aggregate(count ~ ., data = test, FUN = length)

test %>% count(group1, group2, name = "Count")


?

Hope this helps,

Part of the problem is that the "\xb0" byte is not in ASCII, which
covers only the lower half of possible 8-bit bytes. I guess that the
strings containing bytes with highest bit set used to be interpreted as
Latin-1 on your machine, but now get interpreted as UTF-8, which
changes their meaning (in UTF-8, the highest bit being set indicates
that there will be more bytes to follow, making the string invalid if
there is none).

The good news is, since it's Latin-1, which is natively supported by R,
there are even multiple options:

1. Mark the string as Latin-1 by setting Encoding(a) <- 'latin1' and
let R do the re-encoding if and when Pango asks it for a UTF-8-encoded
string.

2. Decode Latin-1 into the locale encoding by using iconv(a, 'latin1',
'') (or set the third parameter to 'UTF-8', which would give almost the
same result on a machine with a UTF-8 locale). The result is, again, a
string where Encoding(a) matches the truth. Explicitly setting UTF-8
may be preferable on Windows machines running pre-UCRT builds of R
where the locale encoding may not contain all Latin-1 characters, but
that's not a problem for you, as far as I know.

For any encoding other than Latin-1 or UTF-8, option (2) is still valid.

I have verified that your example works on my GNU/Linux system with a
UTF-8 locale if I use either option.

Ivan

Thanks Ivan. That solves most of the problem, but there are still
glitches. I get a plot OK, but a substantial number of the characters
are displayed as a wee rectangle containing a 2 x 2 array of digits
such as

>   0 0
>   8 0

Also note that there is a bit of difference between the results of using
Encoding() and the results of using iconv(). E.g. if I do

a <- "\x80"
b <- iconv(a,"latin1","UTF-8")
Encoding(a) <- "latin1"

then when I type "a" I get the Euro symbol "?", but when I type "b"
I get the string "\u0080".

But that doesn't really matter.  More problematic is the fact that if I
do either

    plot(0,0,type="n",xlim=c(0,1),ylim=c(0,1),ann=FALSE,axes=FALSE)
    text(0.5,0.5,labels=a,cex=6)
or

    plot(0,0,type="n",xlim=c(0,1),ylim=c(0,1),ann=FALSE,axes=FALSE)
    text(0.5,0.5,labels=b,cex=6)

then I get wee rectangle with 0 0 8 0 arranged in a 2 x 2 array inside.
(Setting cex=6 makes it easier for my ageing eyes to see what the
digits are.)

Is there any way that I can get the Euro symbol to display correctly in
such a graphic?

Thanks.

cheers,

Rolf

Pick a font that is supported on your OS that has the desired glyph. 
Also look at the examples in:

Interesting. I didn't pay attention to it at first, but now I see that
a range of code points, U+0080 to U+009F, corresponds to control
characters (also, 0+00A0 is non-breakable space), not anything
printable. Also, Latin-1 doesn't define any meaning for bytes
0x80..0x9f, but here they are decoded to same-valued Unicode code
points. And the actual code point for ? is U+20AC, not even close to
what we're working with.

You are right. I didn't know that, but my reading of the function
translateToNative in src/main/sysutils.c suggests that R decodes
strings marked as 'latin1' as Windows-1252 (if it's available for the
system iconv()) and uses the actual Latin-1 as a fallback.

?Encoding does warn that 'latin1' is ambiguous and system-dependent
with regards to bytes 0x80..0x9f, so text() seems to be right to use
Latin-1 and not Windows-1252 when trying to plot byte 0x80 encoded as
CE_LATIN1 as U+0080. Although there's a /* FIXME: allow CP1252? */
comment in src/main/sysutils.c, function reEnc, which is used by text().

> Is there any way that I can get the Euro symbol to display correctly
> in such a graphic?

I think that iconv(a, 'CP1252', '', '\ufffd') should work for you. At
least it seems to work for the ? sign. It does leave the following
bytes undefined, represented as ? U+FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTER:

as.raw(which(is.na(
 iconv(sapply(as.raw(1:255), rawToChar), 'CP1252', '')
)))
# [1] 81 8d 8f 90 9d

Not sure what can be done about those. With Latin-1, they would
correspond to unprintable control characters anyway.

The problem with the Euro symbol is that it was invented after the first 
8 bit encodings, so it was stuck in later.  If you want it, this seems 
helpful:

 From https://web.stanford.edu/~laurik/fsmbook/faq/utf8.html:

"The proper Unicode code point for ? [this may or may not display 
correctly as the Euro sign in your browser] is decimal 8364 (0x20AC). In 
Windows CP1252 ? has the code 128 (0x80); in ISO-8859-15 (also known as 
Latin-9) the ? code is 164 (0xA4); in Macintosh Roman it is 219 (0xDB)."

So a fairly portable way to display it would be "\u20ac".  That works in 
a plot on my Mac; on other graphics devices it depends on whether the 
glyph is defined, but I'd expect it is fairly widespread.

The "\x80" character varies across 8 bit encodings.  In many of them 
it's a non-printable character, but not on Windows.

3L))

str(x)
#? cplx [1:5, 1:3, 1:3] 5.62+0i 5.76+0i 8.52+0i ...

The dimensions (i,j,k) of my array are 5, 3, 3. For every value of i, I 
am interested in the squared matrices made up of the j columns for all 
the k indice. For a given value i I have to keep the row i for every k. 
For example if i=1, I am interested by the matrix x[1,,]
##
x[1,,]

##? ??????????? [,1]???????? [,2]???????? [,3]
## [1,]? 5.619679+0i -2.695220+0i -6.772295+0i
## [2,] -2.695220-0i? 3.168315+0i? 3.797884-0i
## [3,] -6.772295-0i? 3.797884+0i? 8.558108+0i

Now, for every value of i, I want to calculate the SVD decomposition and 
get the diagonal matrix created by the singular values. When I set the i 
value it works:
diag( svd(x[1,,])$d )

# [,1]???? [,2]????? [,3]
# [1,] 15.73833 0.000000 0.0000000
# [2,]? 0.00000 1.502771 0.0000000
# [3,]? 0.00000 0.000000 0.1049992


But when I try to do a loop on the i value it doesn't work:

apply(x, c(2,3), FUN = function(x) diag( svd(x)$d ))


# [,1]??????? [,2]??????? [,3]
# [1,] Numeric,361 Numeric,81? Numeric,144
# [2,] Numeric,81? Numeric,400 Numeric,81
# [3,] Numeric,144 Numeric,81? Numeric,900

I do not understand how to do the apply on an array in order to get my 
diagonals matrices. I think that I miss something about the 
understanding of the array object.

Thank you for your help

Laurent

Hi Laurent,
I am not sure how to get apply()  to work but the following uses lapply()
and returns the matrices in a list.

lapply(1:3, FUN = function(i) diag( svd(x[i,,])$d ))

HTH,
Eric

Thank you very much Eric, I did not think to use lapply.

apply _always_ returns a matrix of vector results. That is, the result of each call to FUN may be a matrix, but a matrix is merely a vector with dimensions that are in this case ignored. So restore the dimensions on the result:

array(apply(x, 1, FUN = function(x) diag( svd(x)$d )), dim=c(3,3,5))

Thank you for the explanations. Indeed I made a mistake for the MARGIN 
understanding. But when I use the command I have an error because there 
is no simplify argument in the apply command ?

Use a different indexing strategy:

res <- apply(x, 1, FUN = function(x) diag( svd(x)$d ))

The result is flattened but each of the columns in that `res`-object are the entries in a 3x3 matrix. Reform it by:

It is good trick and we have to know that R arrays use the 'column major 
mode' to store the value.
Thank you

Subject: [R] conditional output of string to file n times...
Message-ID: <651e323f-30de-37ce-dd6d-0ac0889a6848@gmail.com>

Suppose I have a file with the the following structure - call the two 
space-separated fields 'label' and 'count':

ABC 3
DDG 5
ABB 2


What I need to do is parse each line of the file, and then depending on 
the value of count, write out the value of 'label' to a new file, but 
'count' times. In other words, take the preceding, and output

ABC
ABC
ABC
DDG
DDG
DDG
DDG
DDG
ABB
ABB

I was wondering if there was an elegant/simple way to do this? I can do 
this relatively easily in perl, or awk, but am stumped by getting a bit 
of R code to accomplish the same thing.

Many thanks in advance...

Hi Evan,
I assume you know how to get the data into a data frame (e.g. via read.csv).
Here I will create the example data explicitly, creating a data frame x.

x <- data.frame( label=c("ABC","DDG","ABB"), count=c(3,5,2) )

Then create a character vector with the data as you want it.

y <- unlist(sapply( 1:nrow(x), function(i) rep( x$label[i], x$count[i] ) ))

Finally print it to a file, say 'myfile' (to get one element per line I did
a bit of a trick).

write.table(x=t(t(y)),file="myfile",row.names=FALSE,col.names=FALSE,quote=FALSE)

HTH,

rep(label, times = count) should give you a character vector with the
answer ready for writeLines().

Hello,

Use ?rep.
Since you say you have a file, in the code below I will read the data 
from a connection. Then create the string.


txtfile <- "ABC 3
DDG 5
ABB 2"

tc <- textConnection(txtfile)
df1 <- read.table(tc)
close(tc)

rep(df1[[1]], df1[[2]])
#[1] "ABC" "ABC" "ABC" "DDG" "DDG" "DDG" "DDG" "DDG" "ABB" "ABB"


Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

And just for the fun of it, a tidverse way.  I quite like uncount()

### get the library
library(tidyverse) # or just library(tidyr)

### create data as per nice base R e.g.
x <- data.frame(label = c("ABC","DDG","ABB"), count = c(3,5,2))
### use uncount to ... well, uncount it!
uncount(x, count) -> y
y

# or using tidyverse piping to do the same
x %>%
  uncount(., count) -> y

### and one of many ways to write to a simple file
### make sure you do this in a safe place!
cat(y, file = "safefile.txt", sep = "\n")


Cheers all,

Chris

Figured it out on my own. Basically, use the replicate command for each 
line of the data.frame, then appending to a file.

Subject: [R] How to estimate the parameter for many variable?
Message-ID: <CALcx2Bm+Py5Asc7KT+-2x6mW0j5zO6YNKBFktsn4usjjXAz7DQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

Can I ask something about programming in marginal distribution for spatial
extreme?
I really stuck on my coding to obtain the parameter estimation for
univariate or marginal distribution for new model in spatial extreme.

I want to run my data in order to get the parameter estimation value for 25
stations in one table. But I really didn't get the idea of the correct
coding. Here I attached my coding

x <- data.matrix(Ozone_weekly2)
x
head(gev.fit)[1:4]
ti = matrix(ncol = 3, nrow = 888)
ti[,1] = seq(1, 888, 1)
ti[,2]=sin(2*pi*(ti[,1])/52)
ti[,3]=cos(2*pi*(ti[,1])/52)
for(i in 1:nrow(x))
  + { for(j in 1:ncol(x))
    + {x[i,j] = 1}}

My problem is highlighted in red color.
And if are not hesitate to all. Can someone share with me the procedure,
how can I map my data using spatial extreme.
For example:
After I finish my marginal distribution, what the next procedure. It is I
need to get the spatial independent value.

That's all
Thank you.

Hello,


I can't provide too much help without knowing which packages `hotspot` and
`levelplot` come from. It might be something as simple as
`as.data.frame(matrixaaaaaa)` instead of `matrixaaaaaa`.

 Hello List,
I have a? one column data frame to store file name with extension. I want to create new column to keep file name only without extension.
I tried to use strsplit("name1.csv", "\\.")[[1]] to do that, but it just retain the first row only and it is a vector.? how can do this for all of rows and put it into a new column?
thank you,

Hello,


I would suggest something like `tools::file_path_sans_ext` instead of
`strsplit` to remove the file extension. This is also vectorized, so you
won't have to use a `sapply` or `vapply` on it. I hope this helps!

You would need to loop through the list to use strsplit() -- you are
confused about list structure.

Here's a simple way to do it using regex's -- **assuming that there is
only one period in your names that delineates the extension.** If this
is not true, then this **will fail**. This is vectorized and so will
be more efficient than looping.

d <- data.frame (fn = c("name1.csv", "name2.txt"))
d
d$first <- sub("\\..+","",d$fn)
d

Your example is confusing/garbled.  You are applying strsplit() to a
single character string namely "name1.csv".  Your intent presumably is
to apply it to a *vector* (say "v") of file names.

A syntax which would work is

   sapply(strsplit(v,"\\."),function(x){x[1]})

E.g.

    v <- c("clyde.txt","irving.tex","melvin.pdf","fred.csv")
    sapply(strsplit(v,"\\."),function(x){x[1]})

which gives the output

> [1] "clyde"  "irving" "melvin" "fred"

Note that the output of strplit() is a *list* the i-th entry of which
is a vector consisting of the "split" of the i-th entry of the vector
to which strsplit() is applied.  In your example (corrected, so that it
makes sense, by replacing the string "names.csv" by my vector "v") you
get

    strsplit(v,"\\.")[[1]]
    [1] "clyde" "txt" 

the result of splitting "clyde.txt"; you want the first entry of this
result, i.e. "clyde".

My "sapply()" construction produces the first entry of each entry of the
list produced by strsplit().

It is useful to get your thoughts clear, understand what you are doing
and understand what the functions that you are using do.  (Read the
help!)

Thanks to Ivan Krylov, David Winsemius and Duncan Murdoch for their
informative replies to my cri de coeur.  The most complete answer was
however provided off-list by Andrew Simmons who wrote a new and
carefully structured function plotASCII() to replace my old no-longer
functioning plot_ascii() function.

In the belief that others on the list might well be interested in seeing
Andrew's very elegant solution to my problem, I have attached (with
Andrew's permission) the code for plotASCII() (in the file
"plotASCII.txt").

Note that Andrew, very cautiously, uses syntax such as
"graphics::text(<whatever>) rather than just text(<whatever>).
I guess it never hurts to be cautious.

fwiw, i almost always use '[.]' in preference to '\\\\\\\\.', as it
seems to be more likely to get through the various levels of quoting in

Hi Siti,
I think we need a bit more information to respond helpfully. I have no
idea what "Ozone_weekly2" is and Google is also ignorant. "gev.fit" is
also unknown. The name suggests that it is the output of some
regression or similar. What function produced it, and from what
library? "ti" is known as you have defined it. However, I don't know
what you want to do with it. Finally, as this is a text mailing list,
we don't get any highlighting, so the text to which you refer cannot
be identified. I can see you have a problem, but cannot offer any help
right now.

Hello,

Also, in the code

x <- data.matrix(Ozone_weekly)

[...omited...]

for(i in 1:nrow(x))
   + { for(j in 1:ncol(x))
     + {x[i,j] = 1}}

not only you rewrite x but the double for loop is equivalent to


x[] <- 1


courtesy R's vectorised behavior. (The square parenthesis are needed to 
keep the dimensions, the matrix form.)
And, I'm not sure but isn't

head(gev.fit)[1:4]

equivalent to

head(gev.fit, n = 4)

?

Like Jim says, we need more information, can you post Ozone_weekly2 and 
the code that produced gev.fit? But in the mean time you can revise your 
code.

Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

 Hello all,
I have to learning R from beginning, since my group will get rid of SAS. So, my question may not be very clear for professional R user. I always dealing with column in data frame, not data vector.?
Many thanks to Greg's example. it is very helpful.
one more question, how can I know if the function is for column manipulations or for vector?
Thank you,
Kai

You should be able to download and install a precompiled binary (no

Hi Siti,
I think some progress has been made. You have a data set with 888 rows
and 19 columns:

ow2<-read.table("Ozone_weekly2.txt",
  header=TRUE)
dim(ow2)
[1] 888  19

The values may be parts per million ozone in the atmosphere. The
columns may represent different measuring locations and my guess is
that rows are times of measurement, perhaps in weeks given the name.
If so, you might have run ismev::gev.fit() on all of the columns,
looking for estimated maxima at each location. Is this at all close to
what you are doing?

Dear all,

Thank you very much for the feedback.

Sorry for the lack of information about this problem.

Here, I explain again.

I use this package to run my coding.

library(ismev)
library(mgcv)
library(nlme)

The purpose of this is I want to get the value of parameter estimation
using MLE by applying the GEV distribution.

x <- data.matrix(Ozone_weekly2)                      x refers to my data
that consists of 19 variables. I will attach the data together.
x
head(gev.fit)[1:4]
ti = matrix(ncol = 3, nrow = 888)
ti[,1] = seq(1, 888, 1)
ti[,2]=sin(2*pi*(ti[,1])/52)
ti[,3]=cos(2*pi*(ti[,1])/52)



*for(i in 1:nrow(x))  + { for(j in 1:ncol(x))
the problem in here, i don't no to create the coding. i target my
output will come out in matrix that     + {x[i,j] = 1}}
                   show the parameter estimation for 19 variable which have
19 row and 3 column*


*                                                              row -- refer
to variable (station)  ; column -- refer to parameter estimation for GEV
distribution*thank you.

Hello,

The following lapply one-liner fits a GEV to each column vector, there 
is no need for the double for loop. There's also no need to create a 
data set x.


library(ismev)
library(mgcv)
library(EnvStats)

Ozone_weekly2 <- read.table("~/tmp/Ozone_weekly2.txt", header = TRUE)

# fit a GEV to each column
gev_fit_list <- lapply(Ozone_weekly2, gev.fit, show = FALSE)

# extract the parameters MLE estimates
mle_params <- t(sapply(gev_fit_list, '[[', 'mle'))

# assign column names
colnames(mle_params) <- c("location", "scale", "shape")

# see first few rows
head(mle_params)



The OP doesn't ask for plots but, here they go.


y_vals <- function(x, params){
   loc <- params[1]
   scale <- params[2]
   shape <- params[3]
   EnvStats::dgevd(x, loc, scale, shape)
}
plot_fit <- function(data, vec, verbose = FALSE){
   fit <- gev.fit(data[[vec]], show = verbose)
   x <- sort(data[[vec]])
   hist(x, freq = FALSE)
   lines(x, y_vals(x, params = fit$mle))
}

# seems a good fit
plot_fit(Ozone_weekly2, 1)       # column number
plot_fit(Ozone_weekly2, "CA01")  # col name, equivalent

# the data seems gaussian, not a good fit
plot_fit(Ozone_weekly2, 4)       # column number
plot_fit(Ozone_weekly2, "CA08")  # col name, equivalent



Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Hello,

With the condition for the location it can be estimated like the following.


fit_list2 <- gev_fit_list <- lapply(Ozone_weekly2, gev.fit, ydat = ti, 
mul = c(2, 3), show = FALSE)
mle_params2 <- t(sapply(fit_list2, '[[', 'mle'))
# assign column names
colnames(mle_params2) <- c("location", "scale", "shape", "mul2", "mul3")
head(mle_params2)


Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Dear Rui ang Jim,

Thank you very much.

Thank you Rui Barradas, I already tried using your coding and I'm grateful
I got the answer.

ok now, I have some condition on the location parameter which is cyclic
condition.

So, I will add another 2 variables for the column.

and the condition for location is this one.

 ti[,1] = seq(1, 888, 1)
  ti[,2]=sin(2*pi*(ti[,1])/52)
  ti[,3]=cos(2*pi*(ti[,1])/52)
  fit0<-gev.fit(x[,i], ydat = ti, mul=c(2, 3))

Thank you again.

Subject: [R] How to create a matrix from a list without a for loop
Message-ID: <bdb386ff-f370-3a2d-03f2-090c8d6f74dd@free.fr>

Dear R-Help-list,

 ? I have a list init_l containing 16 dataframes and I want to create a 
matrix 4 x 4 from this list with a dataframe in every cell of the 
matrix. I succeeded to do that but my loop is very uggly (cf. below). 
Could somebody help me to write nice R code to do this loop ?

Thank you very much

Laurent


##
## mock data, 16 dataframes in a list
##
init_l <- lapply( seq(1,16) , function(x) {
 ? data.frame( V1 = rnorm(3),
 ????????????? V2 = rnorm(3),
 ????????????? V3 = rnorm(3)
 ??????????? )
})

##
## lists matrix creation with n = 4 columns and n = 4 rows
##
n <- 4
## an example of row to create the matrix with lists in the cells
one_row <- rbind( rep( list(rep(list(1),3)) , n) )
mymat <- do.call( "rbind" , rep( list(one_row) , n) )

##
## The UGGLY loop I would like to improve:
##

## populate the matrix
k <- 1
for( i in 1:n){
 ? for( j in 1:n){
 ??? mymat[i,j][[1]] <- list( init_l[[ k ]] )
 ??? k <- k+1
 ? }
}

colnames(mymat) <- c("X1", "X2", "X3", "X3")
rownames(mymat) <- c("X1", "X2", "X3", "X4")


mymat

# X1???? X2???? X3???? X3
# X1 List,1 List,1 List,1 List,1
# X2 List,1 List,1 List,1 List,1
# X3 List,1 List,1 List,1 List,1
# X4 List,1 List,1 List,1 List,1


#
# verification, it works
#
mymat[2,2]
init_l[[6]]

##
init_l[[6]]

library(tidyverse)
mymat.t <- as.tibble(mymat)
mymat.t
unnest(mymat.t[2,2],cols="X2")[[1]][[1]]

mymat.df <- as.data.frame(mymat)
mymat.df[2,2][[1]][[1]]


thx

Try
   matrix(init_l, nrow=4, ncol=4,
dimnames=list(c("X1","X2","X3","X4"),c("X1","X2","X3","X4")))
It doesn't give exactly what your code does, but your code introduces an
extra level of "list", which you may not want.

Just assign a dimension attribute and you will have your two dimensional 
structure

Hello List,
I use for loop to read csv difference file into data frame rr.? The data frame rr will be deleted after a comparison and go to the next csv file.? Below is my code:
for (j in 1:nrow(ora))

? rdcsv? <- noquote(paste0("'w:/project/_Joe.B/Oracle/data/", mycsv))
? rr? ? ?<- read.csv(rdcsv)
}
but when I run this code, I got error message below:

it complained about  ASSAY_DEFINITIONS not about  RESPONDENTS.
Can you try with the ASSAY_DEFINITIONS  file?

Subject: [R] problem for strsplit function
In-Reply-To: Your message of "Thu, 08 Jul 2021 15:24:25 +0000."

Kai,

> one more question, how can I know if the function is for column
> manipulations or for vector?

i still stumble around R code.  but, i'd say the following (and look
forward to being corrected! :):

1.  a column, when extracted from a data frame, *is* a vector.

2.  maybe your question is "is a given function for a vector, or for a
    data frame/matrix/array?".  if so, i think the only way is reading
    the help information (?foo).

3.  sometimes, extracting the column as a vector from a data frame-like
    object might be non-intuitive.  you might find reading ?"[" and
    ?"[.data.frame" useful (as well as ?"[.data.table" if you use that
    package).  also, the str() command can be helpful in understanding
    what is happening.  (the lobstr:: package's sxp() function, as well
    as more verbose .Internal(inspect()) can also give you insight.)

    with the data.table:: package, for example, if "DT" is a data.table
    object, with "x2" as a column, adding or leaving off quotation marks
    for the column name can make all the difference between ending up
    with a vector, or with a (much reduced) data table:
----
> is.vector(DT[, x2])
[1] TRUE
> str(DT[, x2])
 num [1:9] 32 32 32 32 32 32 32 32 32
>
> is.vector(DT[, "x2"])
[1] FALSE
> str(DT[, "x2"])
Classes ?data.table? and 'data.frame':  9 obs. of  1 variable:
 $ x2: num  32 32 32 32 32 32 32 32 32
 - attr(*, ".internal.selfref")=<externalptr>
----

    a second level of indexing may or may not help, mostly depending on
    the use of '[' versus of '[['.  this can sometimes cause confusion
    when you are learning the language.
----
> str(DT[, "x2"][1])
Classes ?data.table? and 'data.frame':  1 obs. of  1 variable:
 $ x2: num 32
 - attr(*, ".internal.selfref")=<externalptr>
> str(DT[, "x2"][[1]])
 num [1:9] 32 32 32 32 32 32 32 32 32
----

    the tibble:: package (used in, e.g., the dplyr:: package) also
    (always?) returns a single column as a non-vector.  again, a
    second indexing with double '[[]]' can produce a vector.
----
> DP <- tibble(DT)
> is.vector(DP[, "x2"])
[1] FALSE
> is.vector(DP[, "x2"][[1]])
[1] TRUE
----

    but, note that a list of lists is also a vector:
> is.vector(list(list(1), list(1,2,3)))
[1] TRUE
> str(list(list(1), list(1,2,3)))
List of 2
 $ :List of 1
  ..$ : num 1
 $ :List of 3
  ..$ : num 1
  ..$ : num 2
  ..$ : num 3

    etc.

hth.  good luck learning!

cheers, Greg

 Hi Migdonio,
I did try your code:
# Initialize the rr variable as a list.

rr <- as.list(rep(NA, nrow(ora)))


# Run the for-loop to store all the CSVs in rr.

for (j in 1:nrow(ora))

{

? ? ? ? mycol ?<- ora[j,"fname"]

? ? ? ? mycsv ?<- paste0(mycol,".csv")

? ? ? ? rdcsv ?<- noquote(paste0("w:/project/_Joe.B/Oracle/data/", mycsv))

? ? ? ? rr[[j]] ? ? <- read.csv(rdcsv)

}

this code is working, but rr is not a data frame, R said: Large list ( 20 elements .....). how can I use it as a data frame one by one?
Thank you for your help
Kai

 It seems that your problem is that you are using single quotes inside of the double quotes. This is not necessary. Here is the corrected for-loop:
for (j in 1:nrow(ora))
{
? ? ? ? mycol ?<- ora[j,"fname"]
? ? ? ? mycsv ?<- paste0(mycol,".csv")
? ? ? ? rdcsv ?<- noquote(paste0("w:/project/_Joe.B/Oracle/data/", mycsv))
? ? ? ? rr ? ? <- read.csv(rdcsv)
}
Also note that the rr variable will only store the last CSV, not all CSV. You will need to initialize the rr variable as a list to store all CSVs if that is what you require. Something like this:
# Initialize the rr variable as a list.
rr <- as.list(rep(NA, nrow(ora)))
# Run the for-loop to store all the CSVs in rr.
for (j in 1:nrow(ora))
{
? ? ? ? mycol ?<- ora[j,"fname"]
? ? ? ? mycsv ?<- paste0(mycol,".csv")
? ? ? ? rdcsv ?<- noquote(paste0("w:/project/_Joe.B/Oracle/data/", mycsv))
? ? ? ? rr[[j]] ? ? <- read.csv(rdcsv)
}

The key things to remember are that in R a "list" object is a vector 
whose elements are R objects, and that matrices are just vectors with 
dimension attributes.

Those two ideas are each useful for other things, too!

"1.  a column, when extracted from a data frame, *is* a vector."
Strictly speaking, this is false; it depends on exactly what is meant
by "extracted." e.g.:

> d <- data.frame(col1 = 1:3, col2 = letters[1:3])
> v1 <- d[,2] ## a vector
> v2 <- d[[2]] ## the same, i.e
> identical(v1,v2)
[1] TRUE
> v3 <- d[2] ## a data.frame
> v1
[1] "a" "b" "c"  ## a character vector
> v3
  col2
1    a
2    b
3    c
> is.vector(v1)
[1] TRUE
> is.vector(v3)
[1] FALSE
> class(v3)  ## data.frame
[1] "data.frame"
## but
> is.list(v3)
[1] TRUE

which is simply explained in ?data.frame (where else?!) by:
"A data frame is a **list** [emphasis added] of variables of the same
number of rows with unique row names, given class "data.frame". If no
variables are included, the row names determine the number of rows."

"2.  maybe your question is "is a given function for a vector, or for a
    data frame/matrix/array?".  if so, i think the only way is reading
    the help information (?foo)."

Indeed! Is this not what the Help system is for?! But note also that
the S3 class system may somewhat blur the issue: foo() may work
appropriately and differently for different (S3) classes of objects. A
detailed explanation of this behavior can be found in appropriate
resources or (more tersely) via ?UseMethod .

"you might find reading ?"[" and  ?"[.data.frame" useful"

Not just 'useful" -- **essential** if you want to work in R, unless
one gets this information via any of the numerous online tutorials,
courses, or books that are available. The Help system is accurate and
authoritative, but terse. I happen to like this mode of documentation,
but others may prefer more extended expositions. I stand by this claim
even if one chooses to use the "Tidyverse", data.table package, or
other alternative frameworks for handling data. Again, others may
disagree, but R is structured around these basics, and imo one remains
ignorant of them at their peril.

"Strictly speaking", Greg is correct, Bert.

https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-lang.html#List-objects

Lists in R are vectors. What we colloquially refer to as "vectors" are more precisely referred to as "atomic vectors". And without a doubt, this "vector" nature of lists is a key underlying concept that explains why adding a dim attribute creates a matrix that can hold data frames. It is also a stumbling block for programmers from other languages that have things like linked lists.

And without a doubt, this "vector" nature of lists is a key underlying concept that explains why adding a dim attribute creates a matrix that can hold data frames. It is also a stumbling block for programmers from other languages that have things like linked lists.

I would also object to v3 (below) as "extracting" a column from d. 
"d[2]" doesn't extract anything, it "subsets" the data frame, so the 
result is a data frame, not what you get when you extract something from 
a data frame.

People don't realize that "x <- 1:10; y <- x[[3]]" is perfectly legal. 
That extracts the 3rd element (the number 3).  The problem is that R has 
no way to represent a scalar number, only a vector of numbers, so x[[3]] 
gets promoted to a vector containing that number when it is returned and 
assigned to y.

Lists are vectors of R objects, so if x is a list, x[[3]] is something 
that can be returned, and it is different from x[3].

OK, I stand somewhat chastised.

But my point still is that what you get when you "extract" depends on
how you define "extract." Do note that ?"[" yields a help file titled
"Extract or Replace Parts of an object"; and afaics, the term "subset"
is not explicitly used as Duncan prefers. The relevant part of the
Help file says for "[" for recursive objects says: "Indexing by [ is
similar to atomic vectors and selects a list of the specified
element(s)."  That a data.frame is a list is explicitly stated, as I
noted; that lists are in fact vectors is also explicitly stated (?list
says: "Almost all lists in R internally are Generic Vectors") but then
one is stuck with: a data.frame is a list and therefore a vector, but
is.vector(d3) is FALSE. The explanation is explicit again in
?is.vector ("is.vector returns TRUE if x is a vector of the specified
mode having no attributes other than names. It returns FALSE
otherwise."). But I would say these issues are sufficiently murky that
my warning to be precise is not entirely inappropriate; unfortunately,
I may have made them more so. Sigh....

Cheers,
Bert

 Thanks Bert,
I'm reading some books now. But it takes me a while to get familiar R.

Best,

And without a doubt, this "vector" nature of lists is a key underlying concept that explains why adding a dim attribute creates a matrix that can hold data frames.

I would also object to v3 (below) as "extracting" a column from d. 
"d[2]" doesn't extract anything, it "subsets" the data frame, so the 
result is a data frame, not what you get when you extract something from 
a data frame.

People don't realize that "x <- 1:10; y <- x[[3]]" is perfectly legal. 
That extracts the 3rd element (the number 3).? The problem is that R has 
no way to represent a scalar number, only a vector of numbers, so x[[3]] 
gets promoted to a vector containing that number when it is returned and 
assigned to y.

Lists are vectors of R objects, so if x is a list, x[[3]] is something 
that can be returned, and it is different from x[3].

"But it takes me a while to get familiar R."

Of course. That is true for all of us. Just keep on plugging away and
you'll get it. Probably far better than I before too long.

?"[[" gives you the same page, but I agree:  this part of the 
documentation isn't written very clearly. The "Introduction to R" manual 
uses the terms I used (see section 2.7, "Index vectors; selecting and 
modifying subsets of a data set"), as does the source code (and the R 
Language Definition manual, though it's not as clear as the Intro).

But the point isn't to chastise you, it's to educate you (and the OP). 
Thinking of [] as subsetting is more helpful than thinking of it as 
extraction.  That way the result of x[c(1,2)] makes sense.  It's a 
little bit more of a stretch, but the result of x[[c(1,2)]] also makes 
sense when you think of it as extraction.

My mental model for the `[` vs `[[` behavior is that `[` indexes multiple results while `[[` indexes only one item. If returning multiple items from a list the result must be a list. For consistency, `[` always returns a list when applied to a list. The double bracket drops the containing list.

The is.vector() behavior is not intuitive to me... I avoid that function, as I think it is more useful to think of lists as vectors than as something "other".

A bit too fast there, Duncan... x[[c(1,2)]] is illegal.

This discussion has developed in such a way that it seems a better
subject line would be "problem for the hairsplit function". :-)

Subject: [R] error message from read.csv in loop
In-Reply-To: <550599640.2967267.1625853711087@mail.yahoo.com>

Hello,

1. When there are systematic errors, use ?try or, better yet, ?tryCatch.
Something like the code below will create a list of errors and read in 
the data if none occurred.
The code starts by creating an empty list for tryCatch results. It uses 
?file.path instead of noquote/paste0 to assemble the file name and wraps 
tryCatch around read.csv. Then, after the for loop, it gets the wrong 
reads and displays the error messages.
3. I'm assuming that after processing the data file by file you discard 
the data.frame if it's read without problems and move on to the next 
one. It would also be possible to store them all in a list, together 
with the errors.


ok <- vector("list", nrow(ora))
for (j in 1:nrow(ora))
{
 ? mycol? <- ora[j,"fname"]
 ? mycsv? <- paste0(mycol, ".csv'")
 ? rdcsv? <- file.path("w:/project/_Joe.B/Oracle/data", mycsv)
 ? rr <- tryCatch(read.csv(rdcsv), error = function(e) e)
 ? if(inherits(rr, "error"))
 ??? ok[[i]] <- rr
 ? else ok[[i]] <- TRUE
}

i_err <- sapply(ok, inherits, "error")
for(e in ok[i_err]) message(e$message)


2. I'm assuming that you want to process file by file and? if the data 
are read without problems you discard the data.frame after processing it 
and move on to the next file. It is also possible to store them all in a 
list, together with the errors.


fun <- function(j, data = ora, mypath = "w:/project/_Joe.B/Oracle/data")
{
 ? mycol? <- data[j, "fname"]
 ? mycsv? <- paste0(mycol, ".csv")
 ? rdcsv? <- file.path(mypath, mycsv)
 ? tryCatch(read.csv(rdcsv), error = function(e) e)
}

df_list <- lapply(seq_len(nrow(ora)), fun)
i_err <- sapply(df_list, inherits, "error")
df_list[!i_err]? # these are ok

# hypothetical processing strategy
processing_results <- lapply(df_list[!i_err], function(rr) {
 ? # code goes here
 ? # ...etc...
})


Hope this helps,

Rui Barradas

Thanks again. See you later.

 It seems that your problem is that you are using single quotes inside of
the double quotes. This is not necessary. Here is the corrected for-loop:

for (j in 1:nrow(ora))
{
        mycol  <- ora[j,"fname"]
        mycsv  <- paste0(mycol,".csv")
        rdcsv  <- noquote(paste0("w:/project/_Joe.B/Oracle/data/", mycsv))
        rr     <- read.csv(rdcsv)
}

Also note that the rr variable will only store the last CSV, not all CSV.
You will need to initialize the rr variable as a list to store all CSVs if
that is what you require. Something like this:

# Initialize the rr variable as a list.
rr <- as.list(rep(NA, nrow(ora)))

# Run the for-loop to store all the CSVs in rr.
for (j in 1:nrow(ora))
{
        mycol  <- ora[j,"fname"]
        mycsv  <- paste0(mycol,".csv")
        rdcsv  <- noquote(paste0("w:/project/_Joe.B/Oracle/data/", mycsv))
        rr[[j]]     <- read.csv(rdcsv)
}

Hello Kai,

Just as you did to store the data inside of rr. Try class(rr[[1]]) or
class(rr[[2]]) and so on to explore a bit more. The variable rr is a list
that contains dataframes within it. To access the dataframes you must use
the syntax rr[[i]] where i is the index of the element of the list (or the
number of the dataframe in your case). For example:

df1 <- rr[[1]]
class(df1) # Check if this is class "data.frame".

df2 <- rr[[2]]
class(df2)

You can also try other ways to store the dataframes more efficiently. This
is just a quick-and-dirty solution to the code you provided. I recommend
reading more about lists in R to understand how they work and how they
differ from other data structures like vectors.

Hope this helps,
Warm regards.

Hello, is it kosher to call cox.zph on a syvcoxph model fit? I see that
someone proposed a modified version of cox.zph that uses resid(fit,
'schoenfeld', **weighted=TRUE**).

"It seems that your problem is that you are using single quotes inside of
the double quotes."

That is FALSE. From ?Quotes:
"Single and double quotes delimit character constants. They can be
used interchangeably but double quotes are preferred (and character
constants are printed using double quotes), so single quotes are
normally only used to delimit character constants containing double
quotes."

Of course, pairs of each type of quote must properly match, must not
get confused with quotes in the delineated string, etc. , but they are
otherwise interchangeable. The whole of ?Quotes, especially the
examples, is informative and worth the read (imo).

My method would be to use parse and deparse and substitute.  It would iterate over each file name and build a new list of file names with the last four characters removed to have only the left side, and only the last four remaining to have only the right side.  Then a new dataframe would be created of the partial file names.   

Deparse and substitute to get the file names into a string, then use character removal on the sides, put the file name into a new vector, and then create the relevant data frame if desired.

This allows one to Rely on their software development metaphor.  It might lack a certain finess, but the metaphor is either a loom or a boxing match against a CSV so it?s fun. :)

I think Migdonio is right.  From the error message the problem is that 
the filename was being specified as 
"'w:/project/_Joe.B/Oracle/data/ASSAY_DEFINITIONS.csv'"

That is not a legal filename:  the single quotes probably tell Windows 
to interpret it as a single filename entry, not drive, path, filename. 
Or maybe the drive is being interpreted as "'w", which isn't a legal 
drive id.

In any case, if you set f to an existing full path, and file.exists(f) 
returns TRUE, you'll find that file.exists(paste0("'", f, "'")) returns 
FALSE.

Thank you very much for the clarification. I will try to use a more precise
language next time.

Subject: [R] rWind: Error in if (is.numeric(v) && any(v < 0)) { : missing

Message-ID: <CAC_+zupYzFm+d00L2BzjOo-se8A0OvTeSmFOWFXG9=oqbTBToQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I'm trying to work with rWind but when try to create a shortestpath (From
point a to B with gdistance package) I have this error:


Error in if (is.numeric(v) && any(v < 0)) { :
  missing value where TRUE/FALSE needed

so this is the code:

library(rWind)
library(raster)
library(gdistance)

w<-wind.dl(2020, 2, 12, 0,-17,28,45,50) #download all Mediterranea area

wind<-wind2raster(w) # create two raster about speed and direction wind

Conductance<-flow.dispersion(wind)

AtoBo<- shortestPath(Conductance,spagna,libano,output="SpatialLines")
#create shortestpath (spagna and libano are two SpatialPointsDataFrame)

where I wrong?

Thanks in advance
E

This error can result from v with NAs.
e.g. to reproduce the error message

> v <- as.numeric(NA)
> if (is.numeric(v) && any(v < 0))  cat("hello world\n")

Hi Eric,
I know but I can't understand where is the error.
the function shortestpath wants:

x="TransitionLayer", origin="Coords", goal="Coords"
or
x="TransitionLayer", origin="numeric", goal="numeric"
 or
x="TransitionLayer", origin="SpatialPointsDataFrame",
goal="SpatialPointsDataFrame"

so I followed the example in the rWind package and works, than I changed
the coordinates and I have the error

Subject: [R] density with weights missing values
Message-ID: <1Mv2xO-1lCIn818i0-00qxLT@mail.gmx.net>

Dear R users,

This works as expected:

? plot(density(c(1,2, 3, 4, 5, NA), na.rm=TRUE))

This raises an error

? plot(density(c(1,2, 3, 4, 5, NA), na.rm=TRUE, weights=c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)))
? plot(density(c(1,2, 3, 4, 5, NA), na.rm=TRUE, weights=c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, NA)))

This seems to work (it triggers a warning that the weights don?t add up to 1, which makes sense*):

? plot(density(c(1,2, 3, 4, 5, NA), na.rm=TRUE, weights=c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1)))

Questions

? But shouldn?t the na.rm filter also filter the corresponding weights?
? Extra question: In case the na.rm filter is changed to filter the weights, the check for sum(weights) == 1 might trigger false positive warnings since the weights might not add up to 1 anymore

Best wishes,

Matthias

Weighted mean behaves differently:
? weight is excluded for missing x
? no warning for sum(weights) != 1

Does your copy of R say that the weights must add up to 1?
?density doesn't say that in mine.   But it does check.

The behavior is as documented AFAICS.

na.rm
logical; if TRUE, missing values are removed from x. If FALSE any
missing values cause an error.

The default is FALSE.

weights
numeric vector of non-negative observation weights.

NA is not a non-negative numeric.

The thing is that for na.rm=TRUE, I would expect the weights corresponding to the missing x to be removed, as well. Like in weighted.mean. So this one shouldn't raise an error,density(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, NA), na.rm=TRUE, weights=c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1))Or am I missing something??

My point (confusingly made!) is that documented behavior is all you
should expect. The docs say that weights must be non-negative numeric.
If they aren't...

"Consistency" of behavior among different functions is highly
subjective -- it depends exactly on what one considers to be
"consistent", nicht wahr? And, of course, with thousands of packages
and hundreds of weight functions used for different purposes, this
seems a practical impossibility here.

However, I would agree that given R's "organic" growth over time,
"jarring" inconsistencies (i.e. that most would agree are
inconsistent) may exist. This may be such a case. But, again, all you
can do is follow the docs whether or not the behavior meets your
"reasonable" expectations.

Just my opinion, of course. Consume at your own risk.

Sure, you might think that.

But most likely the reason this code has not been corrected is that when you give weights for missing data the most correct result is for your entire density to be invalid.

Fix your inputs so they make sense to you and there is no problem. But absent your intellectual input to restructure your problem the weights no longer make sense once density() removes the NAs from the data.

You're right, of course. Extrapolating your argument a bit, the whole practice of na.rm is questionable, since there's always a reason for missingness (that is not in x and rarely elsewhere in the data)Best wishes?Matthias?

I think the missing weights are more crucial than equally-weighted missing data would be.

what if there is a heavy weight on the missing values? it could completely change the interpretation of the result.

For what it's worth, I partly agree with you:  if you specify na.rm = 
TRUE, it shouldn't make your x and weights vectors incompatible.

Regarding the warning about the sum of weights:  perhaps there's some 
reason that someone would want to create an unnormalized density, and 
that lets you do it.  An unnormalized mean doesn't make any sense, so I 
wouldn't call it a design flaw that the weighted density behaves 
differently than the weighted mean.  On the other hand, it would likely 
make more sense to normalize the density, and that's how I hope I would 
have designed it.

Thinking about this, I guessed density() was a really old function, so 
this was a case of trying to be S-compatible, but it turns out the 
weights argument was added in 2005 in r34130, so perhaps someone still 
remembers what the thinking was.

P.S.  I think you're posting in HTML, which makes your messages look

The cox.zph function does a formal score test.  No, it does not account for robust 
variance.  I hadn't considered that case, but will now think about it.  It is quite easy 
to show that there is a problem: just give everyone a weight of 100.

The stackexchange conversation was new to me.  The solution there won't work with the 
current code, which does not make use of resid().  It has been updated to do the proper 
score test, the older version of cox.zph, which they modified, used an approximation.

I'm sure the 'weights' argument in weighted.mean() has been used
much more often than the one in density().
Hence, it's quite "probable statistically" :-)  that the
weighted.mean() behavior in the NA case has been more rational
and thought through 

So I agree with you, Matthias, that ideally density() should
behave differently here,  probably entirely analogously to weighted.mean().

Still, Bert and others are right that there is no bug formally,
but something that possibly should be changed; even though it
breaks back compatibility for those cases,  such case may be
very rare (I'm not sure I've ever used weights in density() but
I know I've used it very much all those 25 years ..).

https://www.r-project.org/bugs.html

contains good information about determining if something may be
a bug in R *and* tell you how to apply for an account on R's
bugzilla for reporting it formally.
I'm hereby encouraging you, Matthias, to do that and then in
your report mention both density() and weighted.mean(), i.e., a
cleaned up version of the union of your first 2 e-mails..

Thank you for thinking about this and concisely reporting it.

Thanks Martin and the others. I will do so accordingly. 

I guess the 0.1% of the population who uses density with weights will write code like this

x = c(1, 2, 3, NA)
weights = c(1, 1, 1, 1)
density(x[!is.na(x)], weights=weights[!is.na(x)])

These people won?t be affected. For the 0.01% of people with code like this,

density(x, weights=weights[!is.na(x)], na.rm=TRUE)

the corrected version would almost surely raise an error. Note that the error message can, in principle, check if length(x[!is.na(x)]) == length(the provided weights) and tell the programmer that this was the old behavior.

Best wishes,

Matthias

PS. Sorry for the HTML email. I?ve given up trying to fix such behavior.

another small part to could be improved, indeed,
thank you, Richard.

One difference is that density has a named argument 'weights' not 
present in weighted.mean, which instead has 'w' for weights.
Annoying.

So, in your examples, the argument 'weights = ' is always ignored, at 
least for weighted.mean.default:

 > stats:::weighted.mean.default
function (x, w, ..., na.rm = FALSE)
{
     if (missing(w)) {
         if (na.rm)
             x <- x[!is.na(x)]
         return(sum(x)/length(x))
     }
     if (length(w) != length(x))
         stop("'x' and 'w' must have the same length")
     if (na.rm) {
         i <- !is.na(x)
         w <- w[i]
         x <- x[i]
     }
     sum((x * w)[w != 0])/sum(w)
}

But, using 'w' for weights, missing values in weights will work only if 
na.rm = TRUE and they match missing values in x. As documented.

[...]
> ? no warning for sum(weights) != 1

and no warning for sum(w) != 1

That's because the weights w are normalized (after removing weights 
corresponding to missing values in x).
