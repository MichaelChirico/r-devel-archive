# R Mailing Lists

The R ecosystem includes a few mailing lists for technical issues. The archives of these lists are freely available, and can be searched specifically (e.g. on Google for `r-devel`) with pattern `{search terms} site:/stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/` (h/t @gmbecker).

This repository exists so you can clone it & then use command-line facilities like `grep`/`awk` to search more flexibly, or if you wanted to turn these archives into a data set (e.g. for NLP).

Infinite gratitude to the maintainers of R, CRAN, and the `r-devel` mailing list.

## `r-devel` archives: technical questions about R itself

> This list is intended for questions and discussion about code development in R. Questions likely to prompt discussion unintelligible to non-programmers or topics that are too technical for R-help's audience should go to R-devel

## `r-package-devel` archives: technical questions about R package development

> This list is to get help about package development in R. The goal of the list is to provide a forum for learning about the package development process. We hope to build a community of R package developers who can help each other solve problems, and reduce some of the burden on the CRAN maintainers. If you are having problems developing a package or passing R CMD check, this is the place to ask!
